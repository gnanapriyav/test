declined In the Shahs judgment                            the significance of the offer is that if he Kosygin could sell MIG23s to Iran                            then he would have no difficulty

Middle                            EastAfrica Shah then said he wanted to make a couple of points                        about visit: I told Kosygin that I                        would not stand for any subversion in Persian Gulf and that I would not                        stand for disintegration of what is left of Pakistan On this latter                            Kosygin agreed that Pakistan as presently constituted                        should remain a political entity As for Gulf area Shah noted that                            Kosygin suggested he talk with                        the people down there Shah said his reaction to this was Who do I talk                        to I cannot talk to the PFLOAG Shah                        then stated that he and Kosygin                        discussed Iraq Kosygin asked him why                        he was building up his military forces According to Shah his rejoinder was                        You are doing the same thing in Iraq Shah said he pointed out to                            Kosygin that he could crush                        Iraq any time he wanted to but that a strong Iran would be a responsible                        power not an adventurous one During course of talks with Kosygin Shah had feeling that Soviet Union                        was most anxious for good relations to be developed between Iraq and Iran                        Shah believes that Soviet interest in this development is due to their                        recognition that this would bring about a stronger Iraq since Iran would be                        stopped from playing its Kurdish card Shah took attitude he would be glad                        to talk with Iraq and will be ready to work things out with Iraq if that                        country were prepared to meet his terms It is clear that Shah has no rpt no intention of making deal with any                        government like present Baathist one in Baghdad He said he is prepared to                        put up with nuisance which Iraq causes him ie border raids killing of                        border guards etc since these things affect him little At this juncture                        Shah repeated that Khalatbari would                        fill me in on other aspects of Kosygin visitThe Embassy                            conveyed the substance of the April

that we take the Shahs                            statements on Irans attitude toward the Soviet Union with a                            considerable grain of salt He continues to make antiSoviet noises to                            us to reassure us at the same time that he continues to improve                            relations with the USSR Ibid                                NEAIRN

security system He said that                        this matter had first come up in passing during his trip to Moscow last fall                        and that it had not been mentioned by Kosygin during recent visit but had been put forward by                        Russian side during drafting of communiqu He stated that he did not see                        how he could object to the language since his only interest was to insure                        that Communist China participated in any such Asian security system At this                        juncture Khalatbari pointed out that                        language of communiqu did not specifically mention Communist China Shah                        bridled and stated If communiqu said all nations of Asia it obviously                        includes Communist China It seems clear that Shah has become a bit touchy                        and defensive about inclusion of this item in communiqu4 Shah then mentioned his concern about stability of Saudi Arabia concern                        which I understand he has voiced many times in past He clearly feels that King Faisal is inflexible and that cooperative relations between                        Saudi Arabia and Iran are not possible under these circumstances He insists                        that King Faisal is supporting                        Sheikh of Ras alKhaimir in making difficulties over Abu MusaIrans occupation of the Gulf island of Abu Musa was                            contested by the Sheikh of Ras alKhaimah and other Arab leaders For                            information on the Gulf islands dispute see Foreign                                    Relations 19691976 volume E4 Documents on Iran and                                Iraq 19691972 Documents 68 and 153 Shah reiterated his                        oftrepeated contention that Abu Musa was stolen from Iran by British                        Even on Russian charts Iran was written in next to that island Shah                        then mentioned King Faisals                        unwillingness to permit designation of strong successor or to bring about                        social reforms which are required in his country Shah indicated he thought                        at one time that Prince Fahd might emerge as strong figure but he doubts now                        that this is coming to pass He mused that Saudi Arabia is really not a                        country but only a couple of cities and that its lack of social progress                        makes it ripe for some type of radical takeover5 Shah then touched on difficulties between Kuwait and Iraq In response to                        a query he admitted that he had encouraged King Hussein to volunteer troops                        to Kuwait in case of hostility but indicated his doubt that Jordanian troops                        could fight effectively that far from Amman He also indicated he had                        encouraged King Faisal to support                        Kuwait but had begun to wonder in recent days whether there were not signs                        that Saudi Arabia was cooling in its support for Kuwaiti position He said                        he would appreciate any information we could provide indicating whether or                        not this garblewas the case6 In discussing change in arrangements with oil consortium to a                        salespurchase agreement Shah stated that US would obviously benefit from                        additional revenues which Iran would acquire He said Most of this money                        will obviously go back to the United States garble with recent dollar                        devaluation American heavy equipment which is best in world would again                        become competitive and Iran would undoubtedly buy it from United States                        rather than Japan He then branched off into a disquisition on merits of                        salespurchase arrangement as against joint ownership ie participation                        arrangements with Saudi Arabia and other OPEC countries One of his points which did not come through                        too clearly was that joint ownership would be hazard to United States if                        any of these countries eg Saudi Arabia were to get a radical Arabtype                        government He emphasized again his view that Iran was farsighted in taking                        over total control of her natural resources since her people could never                        again say that foreigners owned any part of them He reminisced about offer                        he had made to United States ten years ago to buy oil from Iran and store it                        in salt caves or wherever else we                        wanted to United States turned him down he pointed out and since he was                        head of a weak country he saw no point in pursuing matter He commented                        with a smile I will never make you that offer again7 The Shah then turned to economic development of Iran and his concern to                        see to it that its population does not outstrip its growth possibilities He                        stated I intend to hold eventual population growth to 50 million We should                        then be able to have 50 million happy and prosperous people He indicated                        his birth control program was working and interestingly enough he had had                        not one whisper of complaint from Mullahs about it He then veered off to                        discussion of agriculture and benefits being derived from new systems of                        irrigation He indicated his determination to stop grazing of nomadic tribes                        across countryside pointing out that it is destructive and actually                        counterproductive He obviously wants to force nomads into stabling their                        cattle and goats so that individual animals can be fattened to a degree                        which has never before been possible in this country He quoted figures to                        illustrate that nomadic cattle and goats remain skinny and far below their                        potential as food animals8 The Shah indicated that he would be discussing his Air Force with General                            Ryan next week and situation in                        Middle East with Secretary Rush and                        Assistant Secretary Sisco during                        their visit here later this monthRush and Sisco visited Tehran for the NEA Chiefs of Mission Conference April 2324 See Document 14 The report of the conference is in                            the National Archives RG 59 Central                            Files 197073 ORG 32 IRAN At end of audience he looked up                        quite seriously and said I really can think of no problems between our                        countries that I need to raise with you9 As an addendum would like to point out that John McCones testimony before                        Congress on ITTChile affair obviously jarred ShahBoth Houses of Congress were investigating charges                            against the International Telephone and Telegraph Company including the                            allegation that it had attempted to block the 1970 election of Chilean                            President Salvador Allende in cooperation with the US                            Government He is clearly becoming convinced that United States                        Government seems incapable of guarding its secrets There no need for me to                        develop this theme as he did but it behooves us to be scrupulously careful                        about information and views which Shah shares with United States                        GovernmentHelms,frus1969-76v27d12,"1.

about stability of Saudi Arabia concern                        which I understand he has voiced many times in past He clearly feels that King Faisal is inflexible and that cooperative relations between                        Saudi Arabia and Iran are not possible under these circumstances He insists                        that King Faisal is supporting                        Sheikh of Ras

written in next to that island Shah                        then mentioned King Faisals                        unwillingness to permit designation of strong successor or to bring about                        social reforms which are required in his country Shah indicated he thought                        at one time that Prince Fahd might emerge as strong figure but he doubts now                        that this is coming to pass He mused that Saudi Arabia is really not a                        country but only a couple of cities and that its lack of social progress                        makes it ripe for some type of radical takeover5 Shah then touched on difficulties between Kuwait and Iraq In response to                        a query he admitted that he had encouraged King Hussein to volunteer troops                        to Kuwait in case of hostility but indicated his doubt that Jordanian troops                        could fight effectively that far from Amman He also indicated he had                        encouraged King Faisal to support                        Kuwait but had begun to wonder in recent days whether there were not signs                        that Saudi Arabia was cooling in its support for Kuwaiti position He said                        he would appreciate any information we could provide indicating whether or                        not this garblewas the case6 In discussing change in arrangements with oil consortium to a                        salespurchase agreement Shah stated that US would obviously benefit from                        additional revenues which Iran would acquire He said Most of this money                        will obviously go back to the United States garble with recent dollar                        devaluation American heavy equipment which is best in world would again                        become competitive and Iran would undoubtedly buy it from United States                        rather than Japan He then branched off into a disquisition on merits of                        salespurchase arrangement as against joint ownership ie participation                        arrangements with Saudi Arabia and other OPEC countries One of his points which did not come through                        too clearly was that joint ownership would be hazard to United States if                        any of these countries eg Saudi Arabia were to get a radical Arabtype                        government He emphasized again his view that Iran was farsighted in taking                        over total control of her natural resources since her people could never                        again say that foreigners owned any part of them He reminisced about offer                        he had made to United States ten years ago to buy oil from Iran and store it                        in salt caves or wherever else we                        wanted to United States turned him down he pointed out and since he was                        head of a weak country he saw no point in pursuing matter He commented                        with a smile I will never make you that offer again7 The Shah then turned to economic development of Iran and his concern to                        see to it that its population does not outstrip its growth possibilities He                        stated I intend to hold eventual population growth to 50 million We should                        then be able to have 50 million happy and prosperous people He indicated                        his birth control program was working and interestingly enough he had had                        not one whisper of complaint from Mullahs about it He then veered off to                        discussion of agriculture and benefits being derived from new systems of                        irrigation He indicated his determination to stop grazing of nomadic tribes                        across countryside pointing out that it is destructive and actually                        counterproductive He obviously wants to force nomads into stabling their                        cattle and goats so that individual animals can be fattened to a degree                        which has never before been possible in this country He quoted figures to                        illustrate that nomadic cattle and goats remain skinny and far below their                        potential as food animals8 The Shah indicated that he would be discussing his Air Force with General                            Ryan next week and situation in                        Middle East with Secretary Rush and                        Assistant Secretary Sisco during                        their visit here later this monthRush and Sisco visited Tehran for the NEA Chiefs of Mission Conference April 2324 See Document 14 The report of the conference is in                            the National Archives RG 59 Central                            Files 197073 ORG 32 IRAN At end of audience he looked up                        quite seriously and said I really can think of no problems between our                        countries that I need to raise with you9 As an addendum would like to point out that John McCones testimony before                        Congress on ITTChile affair obviously jarred ShahBoth Houses of Congress were investigating charges                            against the International Telephone and Telegraph Company including the                            allegation that it had attempted to block the 1970 election of Chilean                            President Salvador Allende in cooperation with the US                            Government He is clearly becoming convinced that United States                        Government seems incapable of guarding its secrets There no need for me to                        develop this theme as he did but it behooves us to be scrupulously careful                        about information and views which Shah shares with United States                        GovernmentHelms,frus1969-76v27d12,"2.)\n1.

summary1 After presentation of credentials on 5 April I had private conversation                        with Shah Foreign Minister Khalatbari being only other person present2 After brief amenities Shah said his Foreign Minister would brief me on                            Kosygins visit to Iran in                            midMarchIn backchannel message 62 to                                Kissinger April 6                                Helms transmitted the Shahs                            report that Kosygin had offered                            him MIG25s and T65s which he had declined In the Shahs judgment                            the significance of the offer is that if he Kosygin could sell MIG23s to Iran                            then he would have no difficulty introducing them into the Arab states                            of the region I can only assume that this is what the Soviets want to                            do Ibid Box 425 Backchannel Files 1973 Middle                            EastAfrica Shah then said he wanted to make a couple of points                        about visit: I told Kosygin that I                        would not stand for any subversion in Persian Gulf and that I would not                        stand for disintegration of what is left of Pakistan On this latter                            Kosygin agreed that Pakistan as presently constituted                        should remain a political entity As for Gulf area Shah noted that                            Kosygin suggested he talk with                        the people down there Shah said his reaction to this was Who do I talk                        to I cannot talk to the PFLOAG Shah                        then stated that he and Kosygin                        discussed Iraq Kosygin asked him why                        he was building up his military forces According to Shah his rejoinder was                        You are doing the same thing in Iraq Shah said he pointed out to                            Kosygin that he could crush                        Iraq any time he wanted to but that a strong Iran would be a responsible                        power not an adventurous one During course of talks with Kosygin Shah had feeling that Soviet Union                        was most anxious for good relations to be developed between Iraq and Iran                        Shah believes that Soviet interest in this development is due to their                        recognition that this would bring about a stronger Iraq since Iran would be                        stopped from playing its Kurdish card Shah took attitude he would be glad                        to talk with Iraq and will be ready to work things out with Iraq if that                        country were prepared to meet his terms It is clear that Shah has no rpt no intention of making deal with any                        government like present Baathist one in Baghdad He said he is prepared to                        put up with nuisance which Iraq causes him ie border raids killing of                        border guards etc since these things affect him little At this juncture                        Shah repeated that Khalatbari would                        fill me in on other aspects of Kosygin visitThe Embassy                            conveyed the substance of the April

need to raise with you9 As an addendum would like to point out that John McCones testimony before                        Congress on ITTChile affair obviously jarred ShahBoth Houses of Congress were investigating charges                            against the International Telephone and Telegraph Company including the                            allegation that it had attempted to block the 1970

             Government seems incapable of guarding its secrets There no need for me to                        develop this theme as he did but it behooves us to be scrupulously careful

PLANES WOULD BE SOLD FOR ABOUT $3  MILLION EACH AND REPLACED BY IRANIAN PURCHASES OF NEW AIRCRAFT FROM US COSTING ABOUT $5.3 MILLION EACH.   SIMILAR REQUEST WAS MADE BY GOI LAST AUGUST.

ADDRESSEES WILL RECALL THAT DURING PAST YEAR IRAN HAS ASKED AUTHORITY TO SELL OR GIVE PAKISTAN FOLLOWING ITEMS:  80  AP/ ARC-34  RADIO SETS,  1000  F-86  DROP TANKS,\n3.   THROUGHOUT THIS PERIOD SHAH HAS BEEN UNABLE TO UNDERSTAND HOW WE RECONCILE OUR STRONG SUPPORT FOR PAKISTAN WITH REFUSAL TO PERMIT TRANSFER TO IT OF RELATIVELY INSIGNIFICANT,  NON- LETHAL MILITARY HARDWARE AT IRAN S EXPENSE.   SHAH DOES NOT SEE IRAN S AID TO PAKISTAN AS INTENDED TO PREPARE IT FOR HOSTILITIES WITH INDIA,  BUT AS MEANS FOR PRESERVING NATIONAL COHESION.   AS READERS OF OUR REPORTS OF MEETING WITH SHAH ARE WELL AWARE,  HE IS DEEPLY AND INCREASINGLY CONCERNED WITH PRESERVATION OF PAKISTAN.   SUSPICIOUS OF SOVIET DESIGNS AGAINST PAK UNITY,  LACKING CONFIDENCE IN GOP S ABILITY TO DEAL WITH ITS ENORMOUS PROBLEM WITHOUT OUTSIDE AID,  AND FEARING CONSEQUENCES FOR IRAN OF NEIGHBOR S DISINTEGRATION,  HE IS MOVING TO BOLSTER DEFENSES ON EASTERN FRONTIER.   FROM SHAH S PERSPECTIVE IT MAKES EXCELLENT SENSE ALSO TO ASSIST PAKS IN CONTROLLING INTERNAL FORCES WORKING FOR FRAGMENTATION. IMPROVED MOBILITY AND COMMUNICATIONS CAPABILITY FOR PAK INTERNAL SECURITY FORCES WOULD BE SUPPLIED BY ITEMS PROPOSED FOR TRANSFER.\n4.   WE REALIZE THAT RECENT MODIFICATION OF ARMS POLICY FOR PAKISTAN HAS CAUSED SOME PAIN FROM INDIA AND OTHER QUARTERS CRITICAL OF US POLICY IN SUBCONTINENT. HOWEVER,  WE THINK THERE IS MERIT IN CONSIDERING WHETHER WE MIGHT INDICATE TO GOI THAT WE WOULD BE WILLING TO ENTERTAIN REQUESTS FOR TRANSFER OF NON- LETHAL EQUIPMENT ON CASE- BY- CASE BASIS.   BY AUTHORIZING TRANSFER OF NON- LETHAL,  LOW- VISIBILITY HARDWARE,  WE WOULD BOTH ASSIST PAKISTAN AND FURTHER STRENGTHEN OUR TIES WITH IRAN.     SECRET\n5.

summary1 After presentation of credentials on 5 April I had private conversation                        with Shah Foreign Minister Khalatbari being only other person present2 After brief amenities Shah said his Foreign Minister would brief me on                            Kosygins visit to Iran in                            midMarchIn backchannel message 62 to                                Kissinger April 6                                Helms transmitted the Shahs                            report that Kosygin had offered                            him MIG25s and T65s which he had declined In the Shahs judgment                            the significance of the offer is that if he Kosygin could sell MIG23s to Iran                            then he would have no difficulty introducing them into the Arab states                            of the region I can only assume that this is what the Soviets want to                            do Ibid Box 425 Backchannel Files 1973 Middle                            EastAfrica Shah then said he wanted to make a couple of points                        about visit: I told Kosygin that I                        would not stand for any subversion in Persian Gulf and that I would not                        stand for disintegration of what is left of Pakistan On this latter                            Kosygin agreed that Pakistan as presently constituted                        should remain a political entity As for Gulf area Shah noted that                            Kosygin suggested he talk with                        the people down there Shah said his reaction to this was Who do I talk                        to I cannot talk to the PFLOAG Shah                        then stated that he and Kosygin                        discussed Iraq Kosygin asked him why                        he was building up his military forces According to Shah his rejoinder was                        You are doing the same thing in Iraq Shah said he pointed out to                            Kosygin that he could crush                        Iraq any time he wanted to but that a strong Iran would be a responsible                        power not an adventurous one During course of talks with Kosygin Shah had feeling that Soviet Union                        was most anxious for good relations to be developed between Iraq and Iran                        Shah believes that Soviet interest in this development is due to their                        recognition that this would bring about a stronger Iraq since Iran would be                        stopped from playing its Kurdish card Shah took attitude he would be glad                        to talk with Iraq and will be ready to work things out with Iraq if that                        country were prepared to meet his terms It is clear that Shah has no rpt no intention of making deal with any                        government like present Baathist one in Baghdad He said he is prepared to                        put up with nuisance which Iraq causes him ie border raids killing of                        border guards etc since these things affect him little At this juncture                        Shah repeated that Khalatbari would                        fill me in on other aspects of Kosygin visitThe Embassy                            conveyed the substance of the April

                          and Rouse Michaud speculated that the Shah was                            not as tough with Kosygin as he                            would have us believe adding: I suggest that we take the Shahs                            statements on Irans attitude toward the Soviet Union with a                            considerable grain of salt He continues to make antiSoviet noises to                            us to reassure us at the same time that he continues to improve                            relations with the USSR Ibid                                NEAIRN

security system He said that                        this matter had first come up in passing during his trip to Moscow last fall                        and that it had not been mentioned by Kosygin during recent visit but had been put forward by                        Russian side during drafting of communiqu He stated that he did not see                        how he could object to the language since his only interest was to insure                        that Communist China participated in any such Asian security system At this                        juncture Khalatbari pointed out that                        language of communiqu did not specifically mention Communist China Shah                        bridled and stated If communiqu said all nations of Asia it obviously                        includes Communist China It seems clear that Shah has become a bit touchy                        and defensive about inclusion of this item in communiqu4 Shah then mentioned his concern about stability of Saudi Arabia concern                        which I understand he has voiced many times in past He clearly feels that King Faisal is inflexible and that cooperative relations between                        Saudi Arabia and Iran are not possible under these circumstances He insists                        that King Faisal is supporting                        Sheikh of Ras alKhaimir in making difficulties over Abu MusaIrans occupation of the Gulf island of Abu Musa was                            contested by the Sheikh of Ras alKhaimah and other Arab leaders For                            information on the Gulf islands dispute see Foreign                                    Relations 19691976 volume E4 Documents on Iran and                                Iraq 19691972 Documents 68 and 153 Shah reiterated his                        oftrepeated contention that Abu Musa was stolen from Iran by British                        Even on Russian charts Iran was written in next to that island Shah                        then mentioned King Faisals                        unwillingness to permit designation of strong successor or to bring about                        social reforms which are required in his country Shah indicated he thought                        at one time that Prince Fahd might emerge as strong figure but he doubts now                        that this is coming to pass He mused that Saudi Arabia is really not a                        country but only a couple of cities and that its lack of social progress                        makes it ripe for some type of radical takeover5 Shah then touched on difficulties between Kuwait and Iraq In response to                        a query he admitted that he had encouraged King Hussein to volunteer troops                        to Kuwait in case of hostility but indicated his doubt that Jordanian troops                        could fight effectively that far from Amman He also indicated he had                        encouraged King Faisal to support                        Kuwait but had begun to wonder in recent days whether there were not signs                        that Saudi Arabia was cooling in its support for Kuwaiti position He said                        he would appreciate any information we could provide indicating whether or                        not this garblewas the case6 In discussing change in arrangements with oil consortium to a                        salespurchase agreement Shah stated that US would obviously benefit from                        additional revenues which Iran would acquire He said Most of this money                        will obviously go back to the United States garble with recent dollar                        devaluation American heavy equipment which is best in world would again                        become competitive and Iran would undoubtedly buy it from United States                        rather than Japan He then branched off into a disquisition on merits of                        salespurchase arrangement as against joint ownership ie participation                        arrangements with Saudi Arabia and other OPEC countries One of his points which did not come through                        too clearly was that joint ownership would be hazard to United States if                        any of these countries eg Saudi Arabia were to get a radical Arabtype                        government He emphasized again his view that Iran was farsighted in taking                        over total control of her natural resources since her people could never                        again say that foreigners owned any part of them He reminisced about offer                        he had made to United States ten years ago to buy oil from Iran and store it                        in salt caves or wherever else we                        wanted to United States turned him down he pointed out and

turned to economic development of Iran and his concern to                        see to it that its population does not outstrip its growth possibilities He                        stated I intend to

was working and interestingly enough he had had                        not one whisper of complaint from Mullahs about it He then veered off to                        discussion of agriculture and benefits being derived from new systems of                        irrigation He indicated his determination to stop grazing of nomadic tribes                        across countryside pointing out that it is destructive and actually                        counterproductive He obviously wants to force nomads into stabling their                        cattle and goats so that individual animals can be fattened to a degree                        which has never before been possible in this country He quoted figures to                        illustrate that nomadic cattle and goats remain skinny and far below their                        potential as food animals8 The Shah indicated that he would be discussing his Air Force with General                            Ryan next week and

summary1 After presentation of credentials on 5 April I had private conversation                        with Shah Foreign Minister Khalatbari being only other person present2 After brief amenities Shah said his Foreign Minister would brief me on                            Kosygins visit to Iran in                            midMarchIn backchannel message 62 to                                Kissinger April 6                                Helms transmitted the Shahs                            report that Kosygin had offered                            him MIG25s and T65s which he had declined In the Shahs judgment                            the significance of the offer is that if he Kosygin could sell MIG23s to Iran                            then he would have no difficulty introducing them into the Arab states                            of the region I can only assume that this is what the Soviets want to                            do Ibid Box 425 Backchannel Files 1973 Middle                            EastAfrica Shah then said he wanted to make a couple of points                        about visit: I told Kosygin that I                        would not stand for any subversion in Persian Gulf and that I would not                        stand for disintegration of what is left of Pakistan On this latter                            Kosygin agreed that Pakistan as presently constituted                        should remain a political entity As for Gulf area Shah noted that                            Kosygin suggested he talk with                        the people down there Shah said his reaction to this was Who do I talk                        to I cannot talk to the PFLOAG Shah                        then stated that he and Kosygin                        discussed Iraq Kosygin asked him why                        he was building up his military forces According to Shah his rejoinder was                        You are doing the same thing in Iraq Shah said he pointed out to                            Kosygin that he could crush                        Iraq any time he wanted to but that a strong Iran would be a responsible                        power not an adventurous one During course of talks with Kosygin Shah had feeling that Soviet Union                        was most anxious for good relations to be developed between Iraq and Iran                        Shah believes that Soviet interest in this development is due to their                        recognition that this would bring about a stronger Iraq since Iran would be                        stopped from playing its Kurdish card Shah took attitude he would be glad                        to talk with Iraq and will be ready to work things out with Iraq if that                        country were prepared to meet his terms It is clear that Shah has no rpt no intention of making deal with any                        government like present Baathist one in Baghdad He said he is prepared to                        put up with nuisance which Iraq causes him ie border raids killing of                        border guards etc since these things affect him little At this juncture                        Shah repeated that Khalatbari would                        fill me in on other aspects of Kosygin visitThe Embassy                            conveyed the substance of the April

                          and Rouse Michaud speculated that the Shah was                            not as tough with Kosygin as he                            would have us believe adding: I suggest that we take the Shahs                            statements on Irans attitude toward the Soviet Union with a                            considerable grain of salt He continues to make antiSoviet noises to                            us to reassure us at the same time that he continues to improve                            relations with the USSR Ibid                                NEAIRN Files: Lot 76D169 Box                            8 1973 POL3 This suddenly seemed to remind Shah of that part of SovietIranian                        communiqu which referred to Asian collective security system He said that                        this matter had first come up in passing during his trip to Moscow last fall                        and that it had not been mentioned by Kosygin during recent visit but had been put forward by                        Russian side during drafting of communiqu He stated that he did not see                        how he could object to the language since his only interest was to insure                        that Communist China participated in any such Asian security system At this                        juncture Khalatbari pointed out that                        language of communiqu did not specifically mention Communist China Shah                        bridled and stated If communiqu said all nations of Asia it obviously                        includes Communist China It seems clear that Shah has become a bit touchy                        and defensive about inclusion of this item in communiqu4 Shah then mentioned his concern about stability of Saudi Arabia concern                        which I understand he has voiced many times in past He clearly feels that King Faisal is inflexible and that cooperative relations between                        Saudi Arabia and Iran are not possible under these circumstances He insists                        that King Faisal is supporting                        Sheikh of Ras alKhaimir in making difficulties over Abu MusaIrans occupation of the Gulf island of Abu Musa was                            contested by the Sheikh of Ras alKhaimah and other Arab leaders For                            information on the Gulf islands dispute see Foreign                                    Relations 19691976 volume E4 Documents on Iran and                                Iraq 19691972 Documents 68 and 153 Shah reiterated his                        oftrepeated contention that Abu Musa was stolen from Iran by British                        Even on Russian charts Iran was written in next to that island Shah                        then mentioned King Faisals                        unwillingness to permit designation of strong successor or to bring about                        social reforms which are required in his country Shah indicated he thought                        at one time that Prince Fahd might emerge as strong figure but he doubts now                        that this is coming to pass He mused that Saudi Arabia is really not a                        country but only a couple of cities and that its lack of social progress                        makes it ripe for some type of radical takeover5 Shah then touched on difficulties between Kuwait and Iraq In response to                        a query he admitted that he had encouraged King Hussein to volunteer troops                        to Kuwait in case of hostility but indicated his doubt that Jordanian troops                        could fight effectively that far from Amman He also indicated he had                        encouraged King Faisal to support                        Kuwait but had begun to wonder in recent days whether there were not signs                        that Saudi Arabia was cooling in its support for Kuwaiti position He said                        he would appreciate any information we could provide indicating whether or                        not this garblewas the case6 In discussing change in arrangements with oil consortium to a                        salespurchase agreement Shah stated that US would obviously benefit from                        additional revenues which Iran would acquire He said Most of this money                        will obviously go back to the United States garble with recent dollar                        devaluation American heavy equipment which is best in world would again                        become competitive and Iran would undoubtedly buy it from United States                        rather than Japan He then branched off into a disquisition on merits of                        salespurchase arrangement as against joint ownership ie participation                        arrangements with Saudi Arabia and other OPEC countries One of his points which did not come through                        too clearly was that joint ownership would be hazard to United States if                        any of these countries eg Saudi Arabia were to get a radical Arabtype                        government He emphasized again his view that Iran was farsighted in taking                        over total control of her natural resources since her people could never                        again say that foreigners owned any part of them He reminisced about offer                        he had made to United States ten years ago to buy oil from Iran and store it                        in salt caves or wherever else we                        wanted to United States turned him down he pointed out and since he was                        head of a weak country he saw no point in pursuing matter He commented                        with a smile I will never make you that offer again7 The Shah then turned to economic development of Iran and his concern to                        see to it that its population does not outstrip its growth possibilities He                        stated I intend to hold eventual population growth to 50 million We should                        then be able to have 50 million happy and prosperous people He indicated                        his birth control program was working and interestingly enough he had had                        not one whisper of complaint from Mullahs about it He then veered off to                        discussion of agriculture and benefits being derived from new systems of                        irrigation He indicated his determination to stop grazing of nomadic tribes                        across countryside pointing out that it is destructive and actually                        counterproductive He obviously wants to force nomads into stabling their                        cattle and goats so that individual animals can be fattened to a degree                        which has never before been possible in this country He quoted figures to                        illustrate that nomadic cattle and goats remain skinny and far below their                        potential as food animals8 The Shah indicated that he would be discussing his Air Force with General                            Ryan next week and situation in                        Middle East with Secretary Rush and                        Assistant Secretary Sisco during                        their visit here later this monthRush and Sisco

       Files 197073 ORG 32 IRAN At end of audience he looked up                        quite seriously and said I really can think of no problems between our                        countries that I need to raise with you9 As an addendum would like to point out that John McCones testimony before                        Congress on ITTChile affair obviously jarred ShahBoth Houses of Congress were investigating charges                            against the International Telephone and Telegraph Company including the                            allegation that it had attempted to block the 1970 election of Chilean                            President Salvador Allende in cooperation with the US                            Government He is clearly becoming convinced that United States

5,0.9497053155621845,Depto 951942 Subject: Conversation with                        Shah1 Deputy Secretary accompanied by Sisco and Helms had                        ninetyminute audience with Shah who was in particularly good form as he                        in an expansive mood articulated wellintegrated and balanced tour                        dhorizon of current developments on world scene and in his own region This                        preceded by lengthy and impressive exposition by Shah of internal Iranian                        progress Throughout Shah made frequent references to his high regard for                        President Nixon personally and to                        his policies Secretary Rush lauded                        Irans efforts and at invitation of Shah outlined in some detail President                            Nixons efforts to move away                        from era of confrontation to era of negotiation Secretary Rush underscored warm and friendly                        relations which existed between Iran and US our reliance on Iran as major                        element of stability in the Persian Gulf area our continuing hope Shah will                        play leading role in developing broad regional cooperation among nations of                        the area and our intention to continue to enhance Shahs strength in order                        to deter possible Soviet designs and assure that any discussions and                        negotiations in the future will be from a position of strength2 After normal amenities and photographs Shah spoke at some length on                        internal developments He pointed out with obvious pride to 144 GNP growth last year and developments in both                        industry and agriculture He touched on projected increases of steel looking                        to a goal of 15 million tons within the next 10 years focusing on the                        province of Khuzestan He is                        convinced that in the next decade modern technology will bring Iran to the                        level of advanced European countries that the application of new irrigation                        methods which conserve water and the scientific use of fertilizers will                        produce double and triple crops He focused in particular on the                        extraordinary production of alfalfa sugar cane and other farm products                        resulting from a happy combination of sunray angles and adequate water                        supply resulting from dam construction in recent years He stressed that                        development of infrastructure will provide Iran with the means and                        institutions to help assure its stability He is organizing local village                        councils along with labor associations to build democracy from the                        grassroot Throughout he stressed his own personal involvement and his hope                        that he will live at least another ten years to see his present goals                        achieved He stressed his dedication to developing a modern Iran based on an                        ethic of hard work meaningful rewards for work done in a society based on                        differences in capacities of individuals He sees the two year compulsory                        military service as an essential training to inculcate principles of                        discipline in his people He pointed up the uniqueness of the Iranian                        effort taking the best from a variety of systems citing for example that                        the collectivization of agriculture works in Iran not in the USSR because leadership motivates                        hardworking Iranians living in a climate devoid of the oppression                        characteristic of the Communist regime3 From this the Shah switched into a discussion of Soviet intentions in the                        area identifying Iraq and India as two countries with which the Soviet                        Union has treaties of friendship and which could provide direct avenues in                        the traditional Russian thrust for access to the Persian Gulf and Indian                        Ocean In this context the Shah spoke of his frank talks with Kosygin during visit last month The Shah                        reported he told Kosygin that I                        could not stand for subversion in the Persian Gulf and that I could not                        stand for the disintegration of Pakistan He pointed out that the Persian                        Gulf is his lifeline and that it must remain free for the uninterrupted                        passage of his ships and those of the littoral states The Shah explained                        that the breakup of Pakistan could well tempt the Soviets into some deal                        with Afghanistan which would permit a direct thrust to the Indian Ocean He                        stated that trouble in Pakistan would lead to a Vietnam near Russian                        borders a development which Kosygin                        conceded the Soviets would not want to see The Shah also emphasized his                        concern that there be no efforts in Baluchistan or Pushtunistan which could                        lead to their becoming separate entitiesThe                            Baluchis and Pushtuns of Pakistans frontier regions both had separatist                            factions which demanded independence or in the latter case union with                            the Pushtuns of Afghanistan Under the rule of Mohammed Daoud                            Afghanistan contested the existing PakistanAfghanistan border for                            denying selfdetermination to Pakistani Pushtuns and also supported the                            insurrection of the Pakistani Baluchis which threatened to spread to                            Irans Baluchi population As for Iraq the Shah stated that he would react positively to                        Iraqi peaceful overtures but then he would insist on a total end of Iraqi                        incursions across the Iranian border and other evidences of hostility before                        he would make any settlement which deprived him of his Kurdish card He                        indicated that there had been some feelers from Iraq in recent days but did                        not become specific as to the form they took At this point the Shah spoke                        of India its sanctimonious attitude toward the outside world and his                        belief that this country employs a double standard in judging its actions as                        against those of other countries4 Deputy Secretary Rush lauded Shahs                        internal efforts stressing that Irans military strength as well as its                        internal strength were a major element of stability in the Gulf In some                        detail he commented on various aspects of the internal developments                        described by the Shah drawing various analogies to our experiences in                        agriculture After reiterating the warm personal and official relations that                        exist between President and Shah Rush outlined specifics of Presidents policies in opening                        dialogue with Communist China concrete agreements with Soviet Union moves                        toward dtente and the positive impact of these moves on the Persian Gulf                        and Arabian Peninsula areaRush and Sisco met on April 24 with Hoveyda who stated that Iran welcomed dtente but                            feared that it might release Soviet energies for the Middle East                                Hoveyda stated: As for this                            area Iran is far too vital to United States interest for the US to                            make any deals behind Irans back At the same time Iran cannot expect                            the US to come to its assistance and Iran must stand on its own feet                            This costs a lot but there is no alternative Pakistan thought it could                            rely on its membership in CENTO and                                SEATO and on its special                            relationship with the US to help ensure its security However look                            what happened in 1965 and 1971 Pakistan stood alone and lost                            National Archives

clear our assessment parallels in very large measure that of                        the Shahs on the significance of worldwide and regional developments Shah                        was much interested

                   concern any move which could threaten the political independence and                        territorial integrity of Pakistan He stressed Iran must be strong                        Secretary Rush agreed with Shahs                        efforts to try to improve relations with all of its neighbors including                        Iraq since Iran would be doing so from a position of strength5 In response to a question from Secretary Rush about Saudi Arabia the Shah replied that his relations                        with King Faisal personally were good and that he regarded him                        almost as a brother On the other hand he pointed out the Saudis were                        difficult to make ongoing arrangements with and he realized more work would                        have to be done to make a reality out of IranianSaudi collaboration                        Turning to Sheikh Yamanis                        intimation in Washington that Saudi Arabia may be more disposed than in the                        past to use oil as a political weapon in bringing about a settlement of the                        ArabIsraeli conflict the Shah said that he could conceive that a beginning                        to improve the political atmosphere might be based on the Rogers Plan He                        stated that when Egyptian Foreign Minister Zayyat visited Iran in March he told the Shah Egypt will                        accept the Rogers Plan If negotiations in terms of Res 242UN Security Council                            Resolution 242 adopted November 22 1967 called for Israeli withdrawal                            from territories occupied during the 1967 war and acknowledgement of                            the sovereignty territorial integrity and political independence of                            every state in the area were not feasible under Jarring perhaps they could be put in the                        Four Power context Since the Four Powers divided three to one against the                        US the Shah stated perhaps the forum could be expanded by the addition                        of certain littoral states of the Mediterranean such as Italy Greece                        Spain etc In any event the Shah emphasized something should be done to                        ease the situation between Israel and the Arabs if for no other reason than                        to keep President Sadat from embarking on some suicidal military                        venture6 At this juncture in the audience the Shah switched to the current oil                        negotiations between Iran and the consortium He expressed the hope that                        these negotiations could be promptly concluded since in his opinion the                        consortium has nothing to gain by prolonging them He stated that he had                        made up his mind not to push up the price of crude oil beyond what he felt                        was fair ie we wanted adjustment made to compensate for the dollar                        devaluation and he wants to obtain revenues comparable with those which                        will go to the Arab OPEC states as a                        result of the participation agreements In explaining his interest in                        controlling the rise in price of crude oil he pointed out that an excessive                        rise would cause increases in the price of goods and commodities in Europe                        and the US which Iran had to buy and import Such an increase in these                        prices he did not feel would be to Irans advantage at this juncture The                        Shah also indicated that he was against leapfrogging and did not want to see                        it occur7 The Shah pointed out that Iran has recognized most of the Communist                        countries with the notable exception of North Vietnam He said the North                        Vietnamese had not reacted to his overture and that as a result it will be a                        long time before there would be an opening of diplomatic relations8 The Shah and Secretary Rush had an                        exchange about Iranian procurement of American aircraft during which the                        Shah presented his wellknown views about the development of his Air Force                        He reiterated his desire to have the new Chief of Staff of the US Air                        Force come to Iran at the beginning of his term of office rather than at the                        end as General Ryan had done The                        Shah said I want to start right off with the new man so that we can do                        joint planning together during his tenure Rush agreed and discussed with the Shah the role of the                        helicopter in a close support tactical capacityIn an April 27 memorandum to Kissinger Saunders and Appelbaum conveyed the Shahs additional request to                            transfer USorigin aircraft and other equipment to Pakistan Kissinger instructed the Department of                            State to advise Iran that the administration was prepared to consider                            this request favorably pending a

Ibid RG 59 Central                            Foreign Policy Files no film number10 Picking up the theme of worldwide developments Secretary Rush gave a detailed explanation of the                        US position on MBFR CSCE and the                            SALT negotiations With a view to                        assuring the Shah that he could continue to rely on us in the future Deputy                        Secretary Rush outlined in detail our                        defense posture our plans to go ahead on the Trident and B1 He explained                        that the disparity in the number of ICBMs and LCBMs in the SALT agreement was more than compensated by                        our qualitative advantages derived from MIRVing our missiles our B52 our

upon This met with a very                        affirmative nod from the Shah Rush                        said we will continue our diplomatic efforts to get the parties to the                        ArabIsraeli dispute negotiating11 Secretary Rush concluded the                        audience by again extending the Presidents good wishes and noting his great                        pleasure at the

6,0.9236871968166757,Depto 951942 Subject: Conversation with                        Shah1 Deputy Secretary accompanied by Sisco and Helms had                        ninetyminute audience with Shah who was in particularly good form as he                        in an expansive mood articulated wellintegrated and balanced tour                        dhorizon of current developments on world scene and in his own region This                        preceded by lengthy and impressive exposition by Shah of internal Iranian                        progress Throughout Shah made frequent references to his high regard for                        President Nixon personally and to                        his policies Secretary Rush lauded                        Irans efforts and at invitation of Shah outlined in some detail President                            Nixons efforts to move away                        from era of confrontation to era of negotiation Secretary Rush underscored warm and friendly                        relations which existed between Iran and US our reliance on Iran as major                        element of stability in the Persian Gulf area our continuing hope Shah will                        play leading role in developing broad regional cooperation among nations of                        the area and our intention to continue to enhance Shahs strength in order                        to deter possible Soviet designs and assure that any discussions and                        negotiations in the future will be from a position of strength2 After normal amenities and photographs Shah spoke at some length on                        internal developments He pointed out with obvious pride to 144 GNP growth last year and developments in both                        industry and agriculture He touched on projected increases of steel looking                        to a goal of 15 million tons within the next 10 years focusing on the                        province of Khuzestan He is                        convinced that in the next decade modern technology will bring Iran to the                        level of advanced European countries that the application of new irrigation                        methods which conserve water and the scientific use of fertilizers will                        produce double and triple crops He focused in particular on the                        extraordinary production of alfalfa sugar cane and other farm products                        resulting from a happy combination of sunray angles and adequate water                        supply resulting from dam construction in recent years He stressed that                        development of infrastructure will provide Iran with the means and                        institutions to help assure its stability He is organizing local village                        councils along with labor associations to build democracy from the                        grassroot Throughout he stressed his own personal involvement and his hope                        that he will live at least another ten years to see his present goals                        achieved He stressed his dedication to developing a modern Iran based on an                        ethic of hard work meaningful rewards for work done in a society based on                        differences in capacities of individuals He sees the two year compulsory                        military service as an essential training to inculcate principles of                        discipline in his people He pointed up the uniqueness of the Iranian                        effort taking the best from a variety of systems citing for example that                        the collectivization of agriculture works in Iran not in the USSR because leadership motivates                        hardworking Iranians living in a climate devoid of the oppression                        characteristic of the Communist regime3 From this the Shah switched into a discussion of Soviet intentions in the                        area identifying Iraq and India as two countries with which the Soviet                        Union has treaties of friendship and which could provide direct avenues in                        the traditional Russian thrust for access to the Persian Gulf and Indian                        Ocean In this context the Shah spoke of his frank talks with Kosygin during visit last month The Shah                        reported he told Kosygin that I                        could not stand for subversion in the Persian Gulf and that I could not                        stand for the disintegration of Pakistan He pointed out that the Persian                        Gulf is his lifeline and that it must remain free for the uninterrupted                        passage of his ships and those of the littoral states The Shah explained                        that the breakup of Pakistan could well tempt the Soviets into some deal                        with Afghanistan which would permit a direct thrust to the Indian Ocean He                        stated that trouble in Pakistan would lead to a Vietnam near Russian                        borders a development which Kosygin                        conceded the Soviets would not want to see The Shah also emphasized his                        concern that there be no efforts in Baluchistan or Pushtunistan which could                        lead to their becoming separate entitiesThe                            Baluchis and Pushtuns of Pakistans frontier regions both had separatist                            factions which demanded independence or in the latter case union with                            the Pushtuns of Afghanistan Under the rule of Mohammed Daoud                            Afghanistan contested the existing PakistanAfghanistan border for                            denying selfdetermination to Pakistani Pushtuns and also supported the                            insurrection of the Pakistani Baluchis which threatened to spread to                            Irans Baluchi population As for Iraq the Shah stated that he would react positively to                        Iraqi peaceful overtures but then he would insist on a total end of Iraqi                        incursions across the Iranian border and other evidences of hostility before                        he would make any settlement which deprived him of his Kurdish card He                        indicated that there had been some feelers from Iraq in recent days but did                        not become specific as to the form they took At this point the Shah spoke                        of India its sanctimonious attitude toward the outside world and his                        belief that this country employs a double standard in judging its actions as                        against those of other countries4 Deputy Secretary Rush lauded Shahs                        internal efforts stressing that Irans military strength as well as its                        internal strength were a major element of stability in the Gulf In some                        detail he commented on various aspects of the internal developments                        described by the Shah drawing various analogies to our experiences in                        agriculture After reiterating the warm personal and official relations that                        exist between President and Shah Rush outlined specifics of Presidents policies in opening                        dialogue with Communist China concrete agreements with Soviet Union moves                        toward dtente and the positive impact of these moves on the Persian Gulf                        and Arabian Peninsula areaRush and Sisco met on April 24 with Hoveyda who stated that Iran welcomed dtente but                            feared that it might release Soviet energies for the Middle East                                Hoveyda stated: As for this                            area Iran is far too vital to United States interest for the US to                            make any deals behind Irans back At the same time Iran cannot expect                            the US to come to its assistance and Iran must stand on its own feet                            This costs a lot but there is no alternative Pakistan thought it could                            rely on its membership in CENTO and                                SEATO and on its special                            relationship with the US to help ensure its security However look                            what happened in 1965 and 1971 Pakistan stood alone and lost                            National Archives

clear our assessment parallels in very large measure that of                        the Shahs on the significance of worldwide and regional developments Shah                        was much interested in rundown which Secretary Rush gave of trip to the Subcontinent the Simla process                        the recent IndiaBangladesh proposals Mrs Gandhis current outlook our                        intention to maintain strong bond of friendship with Pakistan and Iran while                        trying to improve if possible our relations with India Rush assured Shah that US would view with                        concern any move which could threaten the political independence and                        territorial integrity of Pakistan He stressed Iran must be strong                        Secretary Rush agreed with Shahs                        efforts to try to improve relations with all of its neighbors including                        Iraq since Iran would be doing so from a position of strength5 In response to a question from Secretary Rush about Saudi Arabia the Shah replied that his relations                        with King Faisal personally were good and that he regarded him                        almost as a brother On the other hand he pointed out the Saudis were                        difficult to make ongoing arrangements with and he realized more work would                        have to be done to make a reality out of IranianSaudi collaboration                        Turning to Sheikh Yamanis                        intimation in Washington that Saudi Arabia may be more disposed than in the                        past to use oil as a political weapon in bringing about a settlement of the                        ArabIsraeli conflict the Shah said that he could conceive that a beginning                        to improve the political atmosphere might be based on the Rogers Plan He                        stated that when Egyptian Foreign Minister Zayyat visited Iran in March he told the Shah Egypt will                        accept the Rogers Plan If negotiations in terms of Res 242UN Security Council                            Resolution 242 adopted November 22 1967 called for Israeli withdrawal                            from territories occupied during the 1967 war and acknowledgement of                            the sovereignty territorial integrity and political independence of                            every state in the area were not feasible under Jarring perhaps they could be put in the                        Four Power context Since the Four Powers divided three to one against the                        US the Shah stated perhaps the forum could be expanded by the addition                        of certain littoral states of the Mediterranean such as Italy Greece                        Spain etc In any event the Shah emphasized something should be done to                        ease the situation between Israel and the Arabs if for no other reason than                        to keep President Sadat from embarking on some suicidal military                        venture6 At this juncture in the audience the Shah switched to the current oil                        negotiations between Iran and the consortium He expressed the hope that                        these negotiations could be promptly concluded since in his opinion the                        consortium has nothing to gain by prolonging them He stated that he had                        made up his mind not to push up the price of crude oil beyond what he felt                        was fair ie we wanted adjustment made to compensate for the dollar                        devaluation and he wants to obtain revenues comparable with those which                        will go to the Arab OPEC states as a                        result of the participation agreements In explaining his interest in                        controlling the rise in price of crude oil he pointed out that an excessive                        rise would cause increases in the price of goods and commodities in Europe                        and the US which Iran had to buy and import Such an increase in these                        prices he did not feel would be to Irans advantage at this juncture The                        Shah also indicated that he was against leapfrogging and did not want to see                        it occur7 The Shah pointed out that Iran has recognized most of the Communist                        countries with the notable exception of North Vietnam He said the North                        Vietnamese had not reacted to his overture and that as a result it will be a                        long time before there would be an opening of diplomatic relations8 The Shah and Secretary Rush had an                        exchange about Iranian procurement of American aircraft during which the                        Shah presented his wellknown views about the development of his Air Force                        He reiterated his desire to have the new Chief of Staff of the US Air                        Force come to Iran at the beginning of his term of office rather than at the                        end as General Ryan had done The                        Shah said I want to start right off with the new man so that we can do                        joint planning together during his tenure Rush agreed and discussed with the Shah the role of the                        helicopter in a close support tactical capacityIn an April 27 memorandum to Kissinger Saunders and Appelbaum conveyed the Shahs additional request to                            transfer USorigin aircraft and other equipment to Pakistan Kissinger instructed the Department of                            State to advise Iran that the administration was prepared to consider                            this request favorably pending a

Ibid RG 59 Central                            Foreign Policy Files no film number10 Picking up the theme of worldwide developments Secretary Rush gave a detailed explanation of the                        US position on MBFR CSCE and the                            SALT negotiations With a view to                        assuring the Shah that he could continue to rely on us in the future Deputy                        Secretary Rush outlined in detail our                        defense posture our plans to go ahead on the Trident and B1 He explained                        that the disparity in the number of ICBMs and LCBMs in the SALT agreement was more than compensated by                        our qualitative advantages derived from MIRVing our missiles our B52 our

upon This met with a very                        affirmative nod from the Shah Rush                        said we will continue our diplomatic efforts to get the parties to the

7,0.9119205588330848,Depto 951942 Subject: Conversation with                        Shah1 Deputy Secretary accompanied by Sisco and Helms had                        ninetyminute audience with Shah who was in particularly good form as he                        in an expansive mood articulated wellintegrated and balanced tour                        dhorizon of current developments on world scene and in his own region This                        preceded by lengthy and impressive exposition by Shah of internal Iranian                        progress Throughout Shah made frequent references to his high regard for                        President Nixon personally and to                        his policies Secretary Rush lauded                        Irans efforts and at invitation of Shah outlined in some detail President                            Nixons efforts to move away                        from era of confrontation to era of negotiation Secretary Rush underscored warm and friendly                        relations which existed between Iran and US our reliance on Iran as major                        element of stability in the Persian Gulf area our continuing hope Shah will                        play leading role in developing broad regional cooperation among nations of                        the area and our intention to continue to enhance Shahs strength in order                        to deter possible Soviet designs and assure that any discussions and                        negotiations in the future will be from a position of strength2 After normal amenities and photographs Shah spoke at some length on                        internal developments He pointed out with obvious pride to 144 GNP growth last year and developments in both                        industry and agriculture He touched on projected increases of steel looking                        to a goal of 15 million tons within the next 10 years focusing on the                        province of Khuzestan He is                        convinced that in the next decade modern technology will bring Iran to the                        level of advanced European countries that the application of new irrigation                        methods which conserve water and the scientific use of fertilizers will                        produce double and triple crops He focused in particular on the                        extraordinary production of alfalfa sugar cane and other farm products                        resulting from a happy combination of sunray angles and adequate water                        supply resulting from dam construction in recent years He stressed that                        development of infrastructure will provide Iran with the means and                        institutions to help assure its stability He is organizing local village                        councils along with labor associations to build democracy from the                        grassroot Throughout he stressed his own personal involvement and his hope                        that he will live at least another ten years to see his present goals                        achieved He stressed his dedication to developing a modern Iran based on an                        ethic of hard work meaningful rewards for work done in a society based on                        differences in capacities of individuals He sees the two year compulsory                        military service as an essential training to inculcate principles of                        discipline in his people He pointed up the uniqueness of the Iranian                        effort taking the best from a variety of systems citing for example that                        the collectivization of agriculture works in Iran not in the USSR because leadership motivates                        hardworking Iranians living in a climate devoid of the oppression                        characteristic of the Communist regime3 From this the Shah switched into a discussion of Soviet intentions in the                        area identifying Iraq and India as two countries with which the Soviet                        Union has treaties of friendship and which could provide direct avenues in                        the traditional Russian thrust for access to the Persian Gulf and Indian                        Ocean In this context the Shah spoke of his frank talks with Kosygin during visit last month The Shah                        reported he told Kosygin that I                        could not stand for subversion in the Persian Gulf and that I could not                        stand for the disintegration of Pakistan He pointed out that the Persian                        Gulf is his lifeline and that it must remain free for the uninterrupted                        passage of his ships and those of the littoral states The Shah explained                        that the breakup of Pakistan could well tempt the Soviets into some deal                        with Afghanistan which would permit a direct thrust to the Indian Ocean He                        stated that trouble in Pakistan would lead to a Vietnam near Russian                        borders a development which Kosygin                        conceded the Soviets would not want to see The Shah also emphasized his                        concern that there be no efforts in Baluchistan or Pushtunistan which could                        lead to their becoming separate entitiesThe                            Baluchis and Pushtuns of Pakistans frontier regions both had separatist                            factions which demanded independence or in the latter case union with                            the Pushtuns of Afghanistan Under the rule of Mohammed Daoud                            Afghanistan contested the existing PakistanAfghanistan border for                            denying selfdetermination to Pakistani Pushtuns and also supported the                            insurrection of the Pakistani Baluchis which threatened to spread to                            Irans Baluchi population As for Iraq the Shah stated that he would react positively to                        Iraqi peaceful overtures but then he would insist on a total end of Iraqi                        incursions across the Iranian border and other evidences of hostility before                        he would make any settlement which deprived him of his Kurdish card He                        indicated that there had been some feelers from Iraq in recent days but did                        not become specific as to the form they took At this point the Shah spoke                        of India its sanctimonious attitude toward the outside world and his                        belief that this country employs a double standard in judging its actions as                        against those of other countries4 Deputy Secretary Rush lauded Shahs                        internal efforts stressing that Irans military strength as well as its                        internal strength were a major element of stability in the Gulf In some                        detail he commented on various aspects of the internal developments                        described by the Shah drawing various analogies to our experiences in                        agriculture After reiterating the warm personal and official relations that                        exist between President and Shah Rush outlined specifics of Presidents policies in opening                        dialogue with Communist China concrete agreements with Soviet Union moves                        toward dtente and the positive impact of these moves on the Persian Gulf                        and Arabian Peninsula areaRush and Sisco met on April 24 with Hoveyda who stated that Iran welcomed dtente but                            feared that it might release Soviet energies for the Middle East                                Hoveyda stated: As for this                            area Iran is far too vital to United States interest for the US to                            make any deals behind Irans back At the same time Iran cannot expect                            the US to come to its assistance and Iran must stand on its own feet                            This costs a lot but there is no alternative Pakistan thought it could                            rely on its membership in CENTO and                                SEATO and on its special                            relationship with the US to help ensure its security However look                            what happened in 1965 and 1971 Pakistan stood alone and lost                            National Archives

clear our assessment parallels in very large measure that of                        the Shahs on the significance of worldwide and regional developments Shah                        was much interested in rundown which Secretary Rush gave of trip to the Subcontinent the Simla process                        the recent IndiaBangladesh proposals Mrs Gandhis current outlook our                        intention to maintain strong bond of friendship with Pakistan and Iran while                        trying to improve if possible our relations with India Rush assured Shah that US would view with                        concern any move which could threaten the political independence and                        territorial integrity of Pakistan He stressed Iran must be strong                        Secretary Rush agreed with Shahs                        efforts to try to improve relations with all of its neighbors including                        Iraq since Iran would be doing so from a position of strength5 In response to a question from Secretary Rush about Saudi Arabia the Shah replied that his relations                        with King Faisal personally were good and that he regarded him                        almost as a brother On the other hand he pointed out the Saudis were                        difficult to make ongoing arrangements with and he realized more work would                        have to be done to make a reality out of IranianSaudi collaboration                        Turning to Sheikh Yamanis                        intimation in Washington that Saudi Arabia may be more disposed than in the                        past to use oil as a political weapon in bringing about a settlement of the                        ArabIsraeli conflict the Shah said that he could conceive that a beginning                        to improve the political atmosphere might be based on the Rogers Plan He                        stated that when Egyptian Foreign Minister Zayyat visited Iran in March he told the Shah Egypt will                        accept the Rogers Plan If negotiations in terms of Res 242UN Security Council                            Resolution 242 adopted November 22 1967 called for Israeli withdrawal                            from territories occupied during the 1967 war and acknowledgement of                            the sovereignty territorial integrity and political independence of                            every state in the area were not feasible under Jarring perhaps they could be put in the                        Four Power context Since the Four Powers divided three to one against the                        US the Shah stated perhaps the forum could be expanded by the addition                        of certain littoral states of the Mediterranean such as Italy Greece                        Spain etc In any event the Shah emphasized something should be done to                        ease the situation between Israel and the Arabs if for no other reason than                        to keep President Sadat from embarking on some suicidal military                        venture6 At this juncture in the audience the Shah switched to the current oil                        negotiations between Iran and the consortium He expressed the hope that                        these negotiations could be promptly concluded since in his opinion the                        consortium has nothing to gain by prolonging them He stated that he had                        made up his mind not to push up the price of crude oil beyond what he felt                        was fair ie we wanted adjustment made to compensate for the dollar                        devaluation and he wants to obtain revenues comparable with those which                        will go to the Arab OPEC states as a                        result of the participation agreements In explaining his interest in                        controlling the rise in price of crude oil he pointed out that an excessive                        rise would cause increases in the price of goods and commodities in Europe                        and the US which Iran had to buy and import Such an increase in these                        prices he did not feel would be to Irans advantage at this juncture The                        Shah also indicated that he was against leapfrogging and did not want to see                        it occur7 The Shah pointed out that Iran has recognized most of the Communist                        countries with the notable exception of North Vietnam He said the North                        Vietnamese had not reacted to his overture and that as a result it will be a                        long time before there would be an opening of diplomatic relations8 The Shah and Secretary Rush had an                        exchange about Iranian procurement of American aircraft during which the                        Shah presented his wellknown views about the development of his Air Force                        He reiterated his desire to have the new Chief of Staff of the US Air                        Force come to Iran at the beginning of his term of office rather than at the                        end as General Ryan had done The                        Shah said I want to start right off with the new man so that we can do                        joint planning together during his tenure Rush agreed and discussed with the Shah the role of the                        helicopter in a close support tactical capacityIn an April 27 memorandum to Kissinger Saunders and Appelbaum conveyed the Shahs additional request to                            transfer USorigin aircraft and other equipment to Pakistan Kissinger instructed the Department of                            State to advise Iran that the administration was prepared to consider                            this request favorably pending a

Ibid RG 59 Central                            Foreign Policy Files no film number10 Picking up the theme of worldwide developments Secretary Rush gave a detailed explanation of the                        US position on MBFR CSCE and the                            SALT negotiations With a view to                        assuring the Shah that he could continue to rely on us in the future Deputy                        Secretary Rush outlined in detail our                        defense posture our plans to go ahead on the Trident and B1 He explained                        that the disparity in the number of ICBMs and LCBMs in the SALT agreement was more than compensated by                        our qualitative advantages derived from MIRVing our missiles our B52 our                        bases etc In short Secretary Rush                        stressed that we intend in the future to remain the number one military                        power in the world and that we can be relied upon This met with a very                        affirmative nod from the Shah Rush                        said we will continue our diplomatic efforts to get the parties to the

8,0.9027821253279569,Depto 951942 Subject: Conversation with                        Shah1 Deputy Secretary accompanied by Sisco and Helms had                        ninetyminute audience with Shah who was in particularly good form as he                        in an expansive mood articulated wellintegrated and balanced tour                        dhorizon of current developments on world scene and in his own region This                        preceded by lengthy and impressive exposition by Shah of internal Iranian                        progress Throughout Shah made frequent references to his high regard for                        President Nixon personally and to                        his policies Secretary Rush lauded                        Irans efforts and at invitation of Shah outlined in some detail President                            Nixons efforts to move away                        from era of confrontation to era of negotiation Secretary Rush underscored warm and friendly                        relations which existed between Iran and US our reliance on Iran as major                        element of stability in the Persian Gulf area our continuing hope Shah will                        play leading role in developing broad regional cooperation among nations of                        the area and our intention to continue to enhance Shahs strength in order                        to deter possible Soviet designs and assure that any discussions and                        negotiations in the future will be from a position of strength2 After normal amenities and photographs Shah spoke at some length on                        internal developments He pointed out with obvious pride to 144 GNP growth last year and developments in both                        industry and agriculture He touched on projected increases of steel looking                        to a goal of 15 million tons within the next 10 years focusing on the                        province of Khuzestan He is                        convinced that in the next decade modern technology will bring Iran to the                        level of advanced European countries that the application of new irrigation                        methods which conserve water and the scientific use of fertilizers will                        produce double and triple crops He focused in particular on the                        extraordinary production of alfalfa sugar cane and other farm products                        resulting from a happy combination of sunray angles and adequate water                        supply resulting from dam construction in recent years He stressed that                        development of infrastructure will provide Iran with the means and                        institutions to help assure its stability He is organizing local village                        councils along with labor associations to build democracy from the                        grassroot Throughout he stressed his own personal involvement and his hope                        that he will live at least another ten years to see his present goals                        achieved He stressed his dedication to developing a modern Iran based on an                        ethic of hard work meaningful rewards for work done in a society based on                        differences in capacities of individuals He sees the two year compulsory                        military service as an essential training to inculcate principles of                        discipline in his people He pointed up the uniqueness of the Iranian                        effort taking the best from a variety of systems citing for example that                        the collectivization of agriculture works in Iran not in the USSR because leadership motivates                        hardworking Iranians living in a climate devoid of the oppression                        characteristic of the Communist regime3 From this the Shah switched into a discussion of Soviet intentions in the                        area identifying Iraq and India as two countries with which the Soviet                        Union has treaties of friendship and which could provide direct avenues in                        the traditional Russian thrust for access to the Persian Gulf and Indian                        Ocean In this context the Shah spoke of his frank talks with Kosygin during visit last month The Shah                        reported he told Kosygin that I                        could not stand for subversion in the Persian Gulf and that I could not                        stand for the disintegration of Pakistan He pointed out that the Persian                        Gulf is his lifeline and that it must remain free for the uninterrupted                        passage of his ships and those of the littoral states The Shah explained                        that the breakup of Pakistan could well tempt the Soviets into some deal                        with Afghanistan which would permit a direct thrust to the Indian Ocean He                        stated that trouble in Pakistan would lead to a Vietnam near Russian                        borders a development which Kosygin                        conceded the Soviets would not want to see The Shah also emphasized his                        concern that there be no efforts in Baluchistan or Pushtunistan which could                        lead to their becoming separate entitiesThe                            Baluchis and Pushtuns of Pakistans frontier regions both had separatist                            factions which demanded independence or in the latter case union with                            the Pushtuns of Afghanistan Under the rule of Mohammed Daoud                            Afghanistan contested the existing PakistanAfghanistan border for                            denying selfdetermination to Pakistani Pushtuns and also supported the                            insurrection of the Pakistani Baluchis which threatened to spread to                            Irans Baluchi population As for Iraq the Shah stated that he would react positively to                        Iraqi peaceful overtures but then he would insist on a total end of Iraqi                        incursions across the Iranian border and other evidences of hostility before                        he would make any settlement which deprived him of his Kurdish card He                        indicated that there had been some feelers from Iraq in recent days but did                        not become specific as to the form they took At this point the Shah spoke                        of India its sanctimonious attitude toward the outside world and his                        belief that this country employs a double standard in judging its actions as                        against those of other countries4 Deputy Secretary Rush lauded Shahs                        internal efforts stressing that Irans military strength as well as its                        internal strength were a major element of stability in the Gulf In some                        detail he commented on various aspects of the internal developments                        described by the Shah drawing various analogies to our experiences in                        agriculture After reiterating the warm personal and official relations that                        exist between President and Shah Rush outlined specifics of Presidents policies in opening                        dialogue with Communist China concrete agreements with Soviet Union moves                        toward dtente and the positive impact of these moves on the Persian Gulf

Middle East                                Hoveyda stated: As for this                            area Iran is far too vital to United States interest for the US to                            make any deals behind Irans back At the same time Iran cannot expect                            the US to come to its assistance and Iran must stand on its own feet                            This costs a lot but there is no alternative Pakistan thought it could                            rely on its membership in CENTO and                                SEATO and on its special                            relationship with the US to help ensure its security However look                            what happened in 1965 and 1971 Pakistan stood alone and lost                            National Archives

clear our assessment parallels in very large measure that of                        the Shahs on the significance of worldwide and regional developments Shah                        was much interested

                   concern any move which could threaten the political independence and                        territorial integrity of Pakistan He stressed Iran must be strong                        Secretary Rush agreed with Shahs                        efforts to try to improve relations with all of its neighbors including                        Iraq since Iran would be doing so from a position of strength5 In response to a question from Secretary Rush about Saudi Arabia the Shah replied that his relations                        with King Faisal personally were good and that he regarded him                        almost as a brother On the other hand he pointed out the Saudis were                        difficult to make ongoing arrangements with and he realized more work would                        have to be done to make a reality out of IranianSaudi collaboration                        Turning to Sheikh Yamanis                        intimation in Washington that Saudi Arabia may be more disposed than in the                        past to use oil as a political weapon in bringing about a settlement of the                        ArabIsraeli conflict the Shah said that he could conceive that a beginning                        to improve the political atmosphere might be based on the Rogers Plan He                        stated that when Egyptian Foreign Minister Zayyat visited Iran in March he told the Shah Egypt will                        accept the Rogers Plan If negotiations in terms of Res 242UN Security Council                            Resolution 242 adopted November 22 1967 called for Israeli withdrawal                            from territories occupied during the 1967 war and acknowledgement of                            the sovereignty territorial integrity and political independence of                            every state in the area were not feasible under Jarring perhaps they could be put in the                        Four Power context Since the Four Powers divided three to one against the                        US the Shah stated perhaps the forum could be expanded by the addition                        of certain littoral states of the Mediterranean such as Italy Greece                        Spain etc In any event the Shah emphasized something should be done to                        ease the situation between Israel and the Arabs if for no other reason than                        to keep President Sadat from embarking on some suicidal military                        venture6 At this juncture in the audience the Shah switched to the current oil                        negotiations between Iran and the consortium He expressed the hope that                        these negotiations could be promptly concluded since in his opinion the                        consortium has nothing to gain by prolonging them He stated that he had                        made up his mind not to push up the price of crude oil beyond what he felt                        was fair ie we wanted adjustment made to compensate for the dollar                        devaluation and he wants to obtain revenues comparable with those which                        will go to the Arab OPEC states as a                        result of the participation agreements In explaining his interest in                        controlling the rise in price of crude oil he pointed out that an excessive                        rise would cause increases in the price of goods and commodities in Europe                        and the US which Iran had to buy and import Such an increase in these                        prices he did not feel would be to Irans advantage at this juncture The                        Shah also indicated that he was against leapfrogging and did not want to see                        it occur7 The Shah pointed out that Iran has recognized most of the Communist                        countries with the notable exception of North Vietnam He said the North                        Vietnamese had not reacted to his overture and that as a result it will be a                        long time before there would be an opening of diplomatic relations8 The Shah and Secretary Rush had an                        exchange about Iranian procurement of American aircraft during which the                        Shah presented his wellknown views about the development of his Air Force                        He reiterated his desire to have the new Chief of Staff of the US Air                        Force come to Iran at the beginning of his term of office rather than at the                        end as General Ryan had done The                        Shah said I want to start right off with the new man so that we can do                        joint planning together during his tenure Rush agreed and discussed with the Shah the role of the                        helicopter in a close support tactical capacityIn an April 27 memorandum to Kissinger Saunders and Appelbaum conveyed the Shahs additional request to                            transfer USorigin aircraft and other equipment to Pakistan Kissinger instructed the Department of                            State to advise Iran that the administration was prepared to consider                            this request favorably pending a

Ibid RG 59 Central                            Foreign Policy Files no film number10 Picking up the theme of worldwide developments Secretary Rush gave a detailed explanation of the                        US position on MBFR CSCE and the                            SALT negotiations With a view to                        assuring the Shah that he could continue to rely on us in the future Deputy                        Secretary Rush outlined in detail our                        defense posture our plans to go ahead on the Trident and B1 He explained                        that the disparity in the number of ICBMs and LCBMs in the SALT agreement was more than compensated by                        our qualitative advantages derived from MIRVing our missiles our B52 our                        bases etc In short Secretary Rush                        stressed that we intend in the future to remain the number one military                        power in the world and that we can be relied upon This met with a very                        affirmative nod from the Shah Rush                        said we will continue our diplomatic efforts to get the parties to the

9,0.8698812830643663,Depto 951942 Subject: Conversation with                        Shah1 Deputy Secretary accompanied by Sisco and Helms had                        ninetyminute audience with Shah who was in particularly good form as he                        in an expansive mood articulated wellintegrated and balanced tour                        dhorizon of current developments on world scene and in his own region This                        preceded by lengthy and impressive exposition by Shah of internal Iranian                        progress Throughout Shah made frequent references to his high regard for                        President Nixon personally and to                        his policies Secretary Rush lauded                        Irans efforts and at invitation of Shah outlined in some detail President                            Nixons efforts to move away                        from era of confrontation to era of negotiation Secretary Rush underscored warm and friendly                        relations which existed between Iran and US our reliance on Iran as major                        element of stability in the Persian Gulf area our continuing hope Shah will                        play leading role in developing broad regional cooperation among nations of                        the area and our intention to continue to enhance Shahs strength in order                        to deter possible Soviet designs and assure that any discussions and                        negotiations in the future will be from a position of strength2 After normal amenities and photographs Shah spoke at some length on                        internal developments He pointed out with obvious pride to 144 GNP growth last year and developments in both                        industry and agriculture He touched on projected increases of steel looking                        to a goal of 15 million tons within the next 10 years focusing on the                        province of Khuzestan He is                        convinced that in the next decade modern technology will bring Iran to the                        level of advanced European countries that the application of new irrigation                        methods which conserve water and the scientific use of fertilizers will                        produce double and triple crops He focused in particular on the                        extraordinary production of alfalfa sugar cane and other farm products                        resulting from a happy combination of sunray angles and adequate water                        supply resulting from dam construction in recent years He stressed that                        development of infrastructure will provide Iran with the means and                        institutions to help assure its stability He is organizing local village                        councils along with labor associations to build democracy from the                        grassroot Throughout he stressed his own personal involvement and his hope                        that he will live at least another ten years to see his present goals                        achieved He stressed his dedication to developing a modern Iran based on an                        ethic of hard work meaningful rewards for work done in a society based on                        differences in capacities of individuals He sees the two year compulsory                        military service as an essential training to inculcate principles of                        discipline in his people He pointed up the uniqueness of the Iranian                        effort taking the best from a variety of systems citing for example that                        the collectivization of agriculture works in Iran not in the USSR because leadership motivates                        hardworking Iranians living in a climate devoid of the oppression                        characteristic of the Communist regime3 From this the Shah switched into a discussion of Soviet intentions in the                        area identifying Iraq and India as two countries with which the Soviet                        Union has treaties of friendship and which could provide direct avenues in                        the traditional Russian thrust for access to the Persian Gulf and Indian                        Ocean In this context the Shah spoke of his frank talks with Kosygin during visit last month The Shah                        reported he told Kosygin that I                        could not stand for subversion in the Persian Gulf and that I could not                        stand for the disintegration of Pakistan He pointed out that the Persian                        Gulf is his lifeline and that it must remain free for the uninterrupted                        passage of his ships and those of the littoral states The Shah explained                        that the breakup of Pakistan could well tempt the Soviets into some deal                        with Afghanistan which would permit a direct thrust to the Indian Ocean He                        stated that trouble in Pakistan would lead to a Vietnam near Russian                        borders a development which Kosygin                        conceded the Soviets would not want to see The Shah also emphasized his                        concern that there be no efforts in Baluchistan or Pushtunistan which could                        lead to their becoming separate entitiesThe                            Baluchis and Pushtuns of Pakistans frontier regions both had separatist                            factions which demanded independence or in the latter case union with                            the Pushtuns of Afghanistan Under the rule of Mohammed Daoud                            Afghanistan contested the existing PakistanAfghanistan border for                            denying selfdetermination to Pakistani Pushtuns and also supported the                            insurrection of the Pakistani Baluchis which threatened to spread to                            Irans Baluchi population As for Iraq the Shah stated that he would react positively to                        Iraqi peaceful overtures but then he would insist on a total end of Iraqi                        incursions across the Iranian border and other evidences of hostility before                        he would make any settlement which deprived him of his Kurdish card He                        indicated that there had been some feelers from Iraq in recent days but did                        not become specific as to the form they took At this point the Shah spoke                        of India its sanctimonious attitude toward the outside world and his                        belief that this country employs a double standard in judging its actions as                        against those of other countries4 Deputy Secretary Rush lauded Shahs                        internal efforts stressing that Irans military strength as well as its                        internal strength were a major element of stability in the Gulf In some                        detail he commented on various aspects of the internal developments                        described by the Shah drawing various analogies to our experiences in                        agriculture After reiterating the warm personal and official relations that                        exist between President and Shah Rush outlined specifics of Presidents policies in opening                        dialogue with Communist China concrete agreements with Soviet Union moves                        toward dtente and the positive impact of these moves on the Persian Gulf                        and Arabian Peninsula areaRush and Sisco met on April 24 with Hoveyda who stated that Iran welcomed dtente but                            feared that it might release Soviet energies for the Middle East                                Hoveyda stated: As for this                            area Iran is far too vital to United States interest for the US to                            make any deals behind Irans back At the same time Iran cannot expect                            the US to come to its assistance and Iran must stand on its own feet                            This costs a lot but there is no alternative Pakistan thought it could                            rely on its membership in CENTO and                                SEATO and on its special                            relationship with the US to help ensure its security However look                            what happened in 1965 and 1971 Pakistan stood alone and lost                            National Archives

clear our assessment parallels in very large measure that of                        the Shahs on the significance of worldwide and regional developments Shah                        was much interested in rundown which Secretary Rush gave of trip to the Subcontinent the Simla process                        the recent IndiaBangladesh proposals Mrs Gandhis current outlook our                        intention to maintain strong bond of friendship with Pakistan and Iran while                        trying to improve if possible our relations with India Rush assured Shah that US would view with                        concern any move which could threaten the political independence and                        territorial integrity of Pakistan He stressed Iran must be strong                        Secretary Rush agreed with Shahs                        efforts to try to improve relations with all of its neighbors including                        Iraq since Iran would be doing so from a position of strength5 In response to a question from Secretary Rush about Saudi Arabia the Shah replied that his relations                        with King Faisal personally were good and that he regarded him                        almost as a brother On the other hand he pointed out the Saudis were                        difficult to make ongoing arrangements with and he realized more work would                        have to be done to make a reality out of IranianSaudi collaboration                        Turning to Sheikh Yamanis                        intimation in Washington that Saudi Arabia may be more disposed than in the                        past to use oil as a political weapon in bringing about a settlement of the                        ArabIsraeli conflict the Shah said that he could conceive that a beginning                        to improve the political atmosphere might be based on the Rogers Plan He                        stated that when Egyptian Foreign Minister Zayyat visited Iran in March he told the Shah Egypt will                        accept the Rogers Plan If negotiations in terms of Res 242UN Security Council                            Resolution 242 adopted November 22 1967 called for Israeli withdrawal                            from territories occupied during the 1967 war and acknowledgement of                            the sovereignty territorial integrity and political independence of                            every state in the area were not feasible under Jarring perhaps they could be put in the                        Four Power context Since the Four Powers divided three to one against the                        US the Shah stated perhaps the forum could be expanded by the addition                        of certain littoral states of the Mediterranean such as Italy Greece                        Spain etc In any event the Shah emphasized something should be done to                        ease the situation between Israel and the Arabs if for no other reason than                        to keep President Sadat from embarking on some suicidal military                        venture6 At this juncture in the audience the Shah switched to the current oil                        negotiations between Iran and the consortium He expressed the hope that                        these negotiations could be promptly concluded since in his opinion the                        consortium has nothing to gain by prolonging them He stated that he had                        made up his mind not to push up the price of crude oil beyond what he felt                        was fair ie we wanted adjustment made to compensate for the dollar                        devaluation and he wants to obtain revenues comparable with those which                        will go to the Arab OPEC states as a                        result of the participation agreements In explaining his interest in                        controlling the rise in price of crude oil he pointed out that an excessive                        rise would cause increases in the price of goods and commodities in Europe                        and the US which Iran had to buy and import Such an increase in these                        prices he did not feel would be to Irans advantage at this juncture The                        Shah also indicated that he was against leapfrogging and did not want to see                        it occur7 The Shah pointed out that Iran has recognized most of the Communist                        countries with the notable exception of North Vietnam He said the North                        Vietnamese had not reacted to his overture and that as a result it will be a                        long time before there would be an opening of diplomatic relations8 The Shah and Secretary Rush had an                        exchange about Iranian procurement of American aircraft during which the                        Shah presented his wellknown views about the development of his Air Force                        He reiterated his desire to have the new Chief of Staff of the US Air                        Force come to Iran at the beginning of his term of office rather than at the                        end as General Ryan had done The                        Shah said I want to start right off with the new man so that we can do                        joint planning together during his tenure Rush agreed and discussed with the Shah the role of the                        helicopter in a close support tactical capacityIn an April 27 memorandum to Kissinger Saunders and Appelbaum conveyed the Shahs additional request to                            transfer USorigin aircraft and other equipment to Pakistan Kissinger instructed the Department of                            State to advise Iran that the administration was prepared to consider                            this request favorably pending a

Ibid RG 59 Central                            Foreign Policy Files no film number10 Picking up the theme of worldwide developments Secretary Rush gave a detailed explanation of the                        US position on MBFR CSCE and the                            SALT negotiations With a view to                        assuring the Shah that he could continue to rely on us in the future Deputy                        Secretary Rush outlined in detail our                        defense posture our plans to go ahead on the Trident and B1 He explained                        that the disparity in the number of ICBMs and LCBMs in the SALT agreement was more than compensated by                        our qualitative advantages derived from MIRVing our missiles our B52 our                        bases etc In short Secretary Rush                        stressed that we intend in the future to remain the number one military                        power in the world and that we can be relied upon This met with a very                        affirmative nod from the Shah Rush                        said we will continue our diplomatic efforts to get the parties to the                        ArabIsraeli dispute negotiating11 Secretary Rush concluded the                        audience by again extending the Presidents good wishes and noting his great                        pleasure at the

ACTING ON SHAH S INSTRUCTIONS,  GENERAL TOUFANIAN,  VICE MINISTER OF WAR,  HAS ASKED WHETHER USG WOULD OBJECT TO IRANIAN SALE TO PAKISTAN OF FOUR OF OLDEST C-130 S IN IIAF INVENTORY.   PLANES WOULD BE SOLD FOR ABOUT $3  MILLION EACH AND REPLACED BY IRANIAN PURCHASES OF NEW AIRCRAFT FROM US COSTING ABOUT $5.3 MILLION EACH.   SIMILAR REQUEST WAS MADE BY GOI LAST AUGUST.

ADDRESSEES WILL RECALL THAT DURING PAST YEAR IRAN HAS ASKED AUTHORITY TO SELL OR GIVE PAKISTAN FOLLOWING ITEMS:  80  AP/ ARC-34  RADIO SETS,  1000  F-86  DROP TANKS,\n3.   THROUGHOUT THIS PERIOD SHAH HAS BEEN UNABLE TO UNDERSTAND HOW WE RECONCILE OUR STRONG SUPPORT FOR PAKISTAN WITH REFUSAL TO PERMIT TRANSFER TO IT OF RELATIVELY INSIGNIFICANT,  NON- LETHAL MILITARY HARDWARE AT IRAN S EXPENSE.   SHAH DOES NOT SEE IRAN S AID TO PAKISTAN AS INTENDED TO PREPARE IT FOR HOSTILITIES WITH INDIA,  BUT AS MEANS FOR PRESERVING NATIONAL COHESION.   AS READERS OF OUR REPORTS OF MEETING WITH SHAH ARE WELL AWARE,  HE IS DEEPLY AND INCREASINGLY CONCERNED WITH PRESERVATION OF PAKISTAN.   SUSPICIOUS OF SOVIET DESIGNS AGAINST PAK UNITY,  LACKING CONFIDENCE IN GOP S ABILITY TO DEAL WITH ITS ENORMOUS PROBLEM WITHOUT OUTSIDE AID,  AND FEARING CONSEQUENCES FOR IRAN OF NEIGHBOR S DISINTEGRATION,  HE IS MOVING TO BOLSTER DEFENSES ON EASTERN FRONTIER.   FROM SHAH S PERSPECTIVE IT MAKES EXCELLENT SENSE ALSO TO ASSIST PAKS IN CONTROLLING INTERNAL FORCES WORKING FOR FRAGMENTATION. IMPROVED MOBILITY AND COMMUNICATIONS CAPABILITY FOR PAK INTERNAL SECURITY FORCES WOULD BE SUPPLIED BY ITEMS PROPOSED FOR TRANSFER.\n4.   WE REALIZE THAT RECENT MODIFICATION OF ARMS POLICY FOR PAKISTAN HAS CAUSED SOME PAIN FROM INDIA AND OTHER QUARTERS CRITICAL OF US POLICY IN SUBCONTINENT. HOWEVER,  WE THINK THERE IS MERIT IN CONSIDERING WHETHER WE MIGHT INDICATE TO GOI THAT WE WOULD BE WILLING TO ENTERTAIN REQUESTS FOR TRANSFER OF NON- LETHAL EQUIPMENT ON CASE- BY- CASE BASIS.   BY AUTHORIZING TRANSFER OF NON- LETHAL,  LOW- VISIBILITY HARDWARE,  WE WOULD BOTH ASSIST PAKISTAN AND FURTHER STRENGTHEN OUR TIES WITH IRAN.     SECRET\n5.

SUMMARY:  DOMESTICALLY,  IRAQ STILL DOWNPLAYING BORDER DIFFERENCE WITH KUWAIT,  BUT IT NOW CLEAR THAT BAATH REGIME CONSIDERS ITS TERRITORIAL DEMANDS AS VITAL AND JUSTIFIED.  SOVIETS MAY BE PLEASED, BUT IRAQIS HAVE NEEDED NO SOVIET INSTIGATION THUS FAR.  DANGER OF MAJOR ESCALATION SEEMS PRESENT.  END SUMMARY.\n2.  FORMIN ABDUL BAQI RETURNED BAGHDAD APRIL 8  FROM 3  DAY VISIT KUWAIT.  HE MADE SHORT STATEMENT THAT DISCUSSIONS WITH KUWAIT WOULD CONTINUE.  IRAQI MEDIA CONTINUE TO TREAT BORDER DISPUTE AS ROUTINE DIFFERENCE OF OPINION.  YET IT IS CLEAR FROM IRAQI STATEMENTS ELSEWHERE,  IRAQI BUILDUP OF ARAFAT AS MEDIATOR,  AND THRUST OF RECENT  CONFIDENTIAL\n3.  IT SEEMS CERTAIN THAT MARCH 20  IRAQI ATTACK WAS PLANNED AT HIGHEST LEVELS OF GOI AND THAT IRAQI OBJECTIVES GO WELL BEYOND DEMARCATION OF BORDER.  IN REMARKABLY FRANK INTERVIEW WITH BEIRUT S WEEKLY AS- SAYYAD ( NOT PUBLISHED HERE)  FORMIN ABDUL BAQI ADMITTED THAT PROBLEM WENT DEEPER THAN BORDER ISSUE AND HE DENIED THAT ANY LEGAL DOCUMENT FIXING BORDER EXISTS.  ABDUL BAQI STRESSED THAT THE TWO ISLANDS ( PRESUMABLY WARBA AND BOUBIYAN) "" ARE VITAL TO US.  ANY FORCE ON THEM COULD BLOCK ROAD TO US.  HOW COULD WE BECOME A GULF STATE IN THIS CASE?""  HE WENT ON TO SAY THAT IRAQI CONDITION FOR DEMARCATION OF BORDERS IS THAT AREA OF TWO ISLANDS BE IRAQI.\n4.  IRAQI DETERMINATION TO HAVE SOME KIND OF CONTROL OVER THIS AREA IS RESULT OF FACT THAT ITS MAJOR PORT OF BASRA CONSIDERED HOSTAGE TO IRAN AND ONLY ALTERNATIVE PORT IS UMM QASR.  UMM QASR IS ALREADY PRINCIPAL PORT FOR RECEIVING MILITARY EQUIPMENT AND MAY SOON REPLACE BASRA AS HEADQUARTERS IRAQI NAVY.  SECONDLY, IRAQ PLANS TO CONSTRUCT DEEP SEA OIL TERMINAL AND MOST LIKELY SITE IS OUT IN GULF OFF UMM QASR.  PIPELINE WOULD PRESUMABLY GO THROUGH AREA DOMINATED BY WARBA AND BOUBIYAN ISLANDS.  THIRDLY,  ABDUL BAQI WAS QUITE HONEST IN SAYING THAT IRAQ COULD NOT BE GULF STATE WITHOUT SECURE PORT IN GULF.\n4.  WHY NOW?  IPC SETTLEMENT CERTAINLY CONTRIBUTED TO IRAQI CONFIDENCE THAT IT COULD NOW MOVE.  SECONDLY,  GOI PROFESSES  TO SEE GROWING ALLIANCE BETWEEN SAUDI ARABIA AND IRAN AND FEARS THAT KUWAIT WILL SOON BE DRAWN IN TO THIS "" U. S.  SPONSORED ALLIANCE OF REACTIONARIES"".\n5.  WHILE IRAQI MOVES MAY HAVE SOVIET SUPPORT,  I BELIEVE IT IS PREMATURE TO ATTRIBUTE IRAQI ACTIONS ON BORDER TO SOVIETS. IRAQI OBJECTIVES DESCRIBED ABOVE GIVE,  IN IRAQI VIEW,  MORE THAN AMPLE JUSTIFICATION AND BAATH LEADERS DO NOT NEED SOVIETS TO TELL THEM WHERE IRAQ S VITAL INTERESTS LIE. VISIT OF SOVIET NAVAL COMMANDER IN CHIEF AND THREE SOVIET SHIPS AT THIS TIME CERTAINLY SEEMS TO SIGNIFY SOVIET SUPPORT FOR IRAQ S AMBITIONS IN GULF,  BUT IT MAY BE THAT IN THIS INSTANCE BAATH ARE CLEVERLY USING SOVIETS RATHER THAN VICE- VERSA.\n6.  SEEN FROM BAGHDAD,  THIS CONFLICT HOLDS REAL DANGER OF MILITARY ESCALATION INVOLVING CONTIGUOUS STATES.  IRAQIS ARE UNLIKELY TO GIVE UP DEMANDS WHICH,  IN THEIR VIEW,  REPRESENT ONLY WAY OF BREAKING IRANIAN STRANGLEHOLD OVER THEIR ACCESS TO GULF. LOWRIE\n",548379

ACCORDING TO FONMIN DIRECTOR OF POLITICAL DEPT,  ISSA AL- HAMAD, KUWAITI- IRAQI BORDER PROBLEM REMAINS UNCHANGED.  GOK SENT NOTE TO GOI RE BORDER SHORTLY AFTER IRAQI DELEGATION LEGT KUWAIT APRIL 8.  IRAQI AMBASSADOR TO KUWAIT HAS SINCE GONE TO BAGHDAD AND RETURNED KUWAIT,  BUT HE DID NOT BRING EXPECTED MESSAGE FROM GOI.\n2.  ARAB LEAGUE SECDEN,  MAHMOUD RIAD, ( WHO VISITED KUWAIT FOR ARAB DEVELOPMENT FUND MEETING APRIL 15-18  AND THEN BAGHDAD)  HAS AGAIN BEEN ACTIVE IN FACILITATION COMMUNICATION BETWEEN GOI AND GOK. ACCORDING TO AL- HAMAD,  RIAD DISCUSSED SITUATION WITH GOK OFFICIALS AND LATER WITH IRAQIS.  LATTER TOLD RIAD THEY HAD BEEN EXPECTING GOK RESPONSE TO PROPOSALS MADE BY THEIR DELEGATION ( PRESUMABLY RE WARBA AND BUBIYAN ISLANDS)  BUT INSTEAD ONLY RECEIVED MEMORANDUM REITERATING GOK POSITION RE DEMARCA- TION OF FRONTIER ALONG LINE DESCRIBED IN 1932  AND 1963  AGREEMENTS. IT NOW APPEARS THAT GOI HAS PROMISED A RESPONSE TO GOK,  HOPEFULLY, BY END OF WEEK ( I. E.  APRIL 27) .\n3.  DEPENDING UPON RESPONSE RECEIVED FROM IRAQ,  GOK WILL DETERMINE NEXT STEP.  IF NO AGREEMENT REACHED ON BORDER,  GOK MAY ASK GROUP OF FRIENDLY ARAB STATES TO ACT AS MEDIATOR IF IRAQ AND KUWAIT CAN AGREE AS TO SPECIFIC STATES TO BE ASKED.  IF THIS FAILS,  GOK PLANS TAKE QUESTION TO ARAB LEAGUE.\n4.  AL- HAMD ALSO SAID THAT WHEN FONMIN SABAH AL- AHMAD WENT TO IRAQ IN MARCH,  IRAQIS TOLD HIM THEY HAD TAKEN DECISION IN PRINCIPLE TO DEMARCATE BORDER FOR FIRST TIME.  HOWEVER,  THEY HAVE NOT YET AGREED ON WHERE BORDER SHOULD RUN.\n5.  INCIDENTALLY,  EMBASSY HAS BEEN RELIABLY INFORMED THAT IN WAKE OF IRAQI ATTACK ON AL- SAMITA,  IRAQIS ACTUALLY BLEW UP THE POST. MOST IRAQI TROOPS AND EQUIPMENT HAVE REPORTEDLY LEFT SAMITA ENCLAVE,  ALTHOUGH ABOUT A COMPANY REMAINS AND KUWAITI FORCES HAVE NOT ENTERED AREA HELD BY IRAQIS. MCCLELLAND\n",542916

AT THE END OF HIS 2- DAY VIST TO KUWAIT ON APRIL 1  ZAYYAT SAID THAT IRAQI AUTHORITIES HAD ASSURED HIM THEIR TROOPS HAD EVACUATED KUWAIT POST OF AL- SAMITA.  HE ADDED,  "" EVEN IF THE IRAQIS HAVE NOT DONE THIS SO FAR, THEIR ASSURANCE TO ME WAS AN INDICATION THAT THEY AGREED SUCH EVACUATION WAS NECESSARY IN ORDER TO SETTLE THE CURRENT BORDER CRISIS.""\n4.

SUMMARY:  DOMESTICALLY,  IRAQ STILL DOWNPLAYING BORDER DIFFERENCE WITH KUWAIT,  BUT IT NOW CLEAR THAT BAATH REGIME CONSIDERS ITS TERRITORIAL DEMANDS AS VITAL AND JUSTIFIED.  SOVIETS MAY BE PLEASED, BUT IRAQIS HAVE NEEDED NO SOVIET INSTIGATION THUS FAR.  DANGER OF MAJOR ESCALATION SEEMS PRESENT.  END SUMMARY.\n2.  FORMIN ABDUL BAQI RETURNED BAGHDAD APRIL 8  FROM 3  DAY VISIT KUWAIT.  HE MADE SHORT STATEMENT THAT DISCUSSIONS WITH KUWAIT WOULD CONTINUE.  IRAQI MEDIA CONTINUE TO TREAT BORDER DISPUTE AS ROUTINE DIFFERENCE OF OPINION.  YET IT IS CLEAR FROM IRAQI STATEMENTS ELSEWHERE,  IRAQI BUILDUP OF ARAFAT AS MEDIATOR,  AND THRUST OF RECENT  CONFIDENTIAL\n3.  IT SEEMS CERTAIN THAT MARCH 20  IRAQI ATTACK WAS PLANNED AT HIGHEST LEVELS OF GOI AND THAT IRAQI OBJECTIVES GO WELL BEYOND DEMARCATION OF BORDER.  IN REMARKABLY FRANK INTERVIEW WITH BEIRUT S WEEKLY AS- SAYYAD ( NOT PUBLISHED HERE)  FORMIN ABDUL BAQI ADMITTED THAT PROBLEM WENT DEEPER THAN BORDER ISSUE AND HE DENIED THAT ANY LEGAL DOCUMENT FIXING BORDER EXISTS.  ABDUL BAQI STRESSED THAT THE TWO ISLANDS ( PRESUMABLY WARBA AND BOUBIYAN) "" ARE VITAL TO US.  ANY FORCE ON THEM COULD BLOCK ROAD TO US.  HOW COULD WE BECOME A GULF STATE IN THIS CASE?""  HE WENT ON TO SAY THAT IRAQI CONDITION FOR DEMARCATION OF BORDERS IS THAT AREA OF TWO ISLANDS BE IRAQI.\n4.  IRAQI DETERMINATION TO HAVE SOME KIND OF CONTROL OVER THIS AREA IS RESULT OF FACT THAT ITS MAJOR PORT OF BASRA CONSIDERED HOSTAGE TO IRAN AND ONLY ALTERNATIVE PORT IS UMM QASR.  UMM QASR IS ALREADY PRINCIPAL PORT FOR RECEIVING MILITARY EQUIPMENT AND MAY SOON REPLACE BASRA AS HEADQUARTERS IRAQI NAVY.  SECONDLY, IRAQ PLANS TO CONSTRUCT DEEP SEA OIL TERMINAL AND MOST LIKELY SITE IS OUT IN GULF OFF UMM QASR.  PIPELINE WOULD PRESUMABLY GO THROUGH AREA DOMINATED BY WARBA AND BOUBIYAN ISLANDS.  THIRDLY,  ABDUL BAQI WAS QUITE HONEST IN SAYING THAT IRAQ COULD NOT BE GULF STATE WITHOUT SECURE PORT IN GULF.\n4.  WHY NOW?  IPC SETTLEMENT CERTAINLY CONTRIBUTED TO IRAQI CONFIDENCE THAT IT COULD NOW MOVE.  SECONDLY,  GOI PROFESSES  TO SEE GROWING ALLIANCE BETWEEN SAUDI ARABIA AND IRAN AND FEARS THAT KUWAIT WILL SOON BE DRAWN IN TO THIS "" U. S.  SPONSORED ALLIANCE OF REACTIONARIES"".\n5.  WHILE IRAQI MOVES MAY HAVE SOVIET SUPPORT,  I BELIEVE IT IS PREMATURE TO ATTRIBUTE IRAQI ACTIONS ON BORDER TO SOVIETS. IRAQI OBJECTIVES DESCRIBED ABOVE GIVE,  IN IRAQI VIEW,  MORE THAN AMPLE JUSTIFICATION AND BAATH LEADERS DO NOT NEED SOVIETS TO TELL THEM WHERE IRAQ S VITAL INTERESTS LIE. VISIT OF SOVIET NAVAL COMMANDER IN CHIEF AND THREE SOVIET SHIPS AT THIS TIME CERTAINLY SEEMS TO SIGNIFY SOVIET SUPPORT FOR IRAQ S AMBITIONS IN GULF,  BUT IT MAY BE THAT IN THIS INSTANCE BAATH ARE CLEVERLY USING SOVIETS RATHER THAN VICE- VERSA.\n6.  SEEN FROM BAGHDAD,  THIS CONFLICT HOLDS REAL DANGER OF MILITARY ESCALATION INVOLVING CONTIGUOUS STATES.  IRAQIS ARE UNLIKELY TO GIVE UP DEMANDS WHICH,  IN THEIR VIEW,  REPRESENT ONLY WAY OF BREAKING IRANIAN STRANGLEHOLD OVER THEIR ACCESS TO GULF. LOWRIE\n",548379

RECENT EDITORIALS IN KDP AT- TAAXHI ALSO SUGGEST SITUATION BETWEEN BAATH AND KURDS REMAINS TENSE.   LAST THREE EDITORIALS CONCENTRATE ON THEME THAT FAILURE OF ARABS VIS- A- VIS IMPERIALISM AND ZIONISM HAS RESULTED FROM LACK OF UNITY AT HOME,  PARTICULARLY ARAB- KURDISH UNITY AS PROVIDED FOR IN MARCH 1970  MANIFESTO.

ALTHOUGH GOI WOULD BE EXTREMELY DISPLEASED TO SEE IRAQ ACHIEVE STRATEGIC GAINS OR POLITICAL CAPITAL FROM MOVES AGAINST KUWAIT, WE DOUBT SHAH WOULD WISH COMMIT NATIONAL FORCES AND PRESTIGE TO AID GOK UNTIL ALL OTHER POSSIBILITIES OF ASSISTANCE WERE     SECRET\n2.  ACCORDINGLY,  WE ARE DUBIOUS SHAH WAS ACTUALLY AS GENEROUS AS HE APPEARS IN KHAMMASH S REPORT ( AMMAN REFTEL).  WE WOULD APPRECIATE ANY FURTHER DETAILS EMBASSY AMMAN CAN OBTAIN.\n3.  WE ALSO DOUBT ON MILITARY GROUNDS THAT GOI WOULD FIND ATTRACTIVE RESERVE AIRCRAFT PROPOSITION DESCRIBED STATE REFTEL. ALTHOUGH IRANIAN RADAR MIGHT PICK UP AN IRAQI STRIKE AT KUWAIT, WE SERIOUSLY DOUBT THAT IRANIAN AIRCRAFT COULD RESPOND IN TIME TO RENDER USEFUL DEFENSE.  PROVIDING CONTINUOUS AIR UMBRELLA OVER KUWAIT WOULD NOT BE FEASIBLE EVEN IF IIAF HAD AIR TANKERS. RETALIATION AGAINST IRAQI TARGETS WOULD PROBABLY BE ONLY ALTERNATIVE OPEN TO IIAF.  THIS COULD INVITE IRAQI COUNTER ATTACK AGAINST HIGHLY VULNERABLE IRANIAN OIL INSTALLATIONS. IF IIAF PLANES WERE TO BE SECRETLY HELD IN RESERVE,  THEY WOULD, OF COURSE,  NOT CONSTITUTE EFFECTIVE DETERRENT AGAINST IRAQI ATTACK.\n4.

changing For                        Iraq Russia is assuming more role of valued supporter but not close                        confidante and certainly not leader of joint alliance There is no longer

with USSR was made by ForMin                        Abdul Baqi in recent interview not published here with Beirut weekly AsSayyad When asked if Iraq wanted two Kuwait                        islands for Soviet fleet Abdul Baqi said Soviets are our friends They                        offer valuable aid without strings We do not accept that the treaty brings                        Soviets to this area Soviets have no bases or armies in Iraq We differ                        with them on many issues    we have our national strategy and ideology                        and they have theirs We dont discuss our strategy in Gulf with Soviets                           our goal is to preserve Arabism of Gulf3 Celebration of first anniversary of SovietIraqi treaty was lackluster                        particularly in comparison to joint celebrations of last December At main                        celebration Apr 9 principal Iraqi address given by Minister of Health and                            RCC member Izzat Mustafa No other                        ranking Iraqi attended Mustafas speech was devoted to generalities but it                        did contain statement that treaty is directed against no one Same phrase                        has appeared in several recent editorials Official AlJumhurriya said Apr 9 that treaty is one of friendship and                        cooperation it is not a military treaty or a collective defense treaty it                        is not directed against any third party it is based on equal cooperation                        Communist weekly AlFikralJadid unrestrained in praise of treaty and said                        alliance with Soviets necessary to guarantee sovereignty and build socialism                        and that it had full support of masses4 Soviet Naval Commander in Chief Gorshkovs presence for anniversary                        celebration was seen as something of a snub to GOI since Saddam                            Hussein had invited top leadership Only two Communist                        Ministers attended Soviet Ambassadors reception for the Admiral on Apr 9                        Soviet cruiser and two destroyers believed to be visiting Umm Qasr or Basra                        in conjunction with Admirals visit Gorshkov visited Basra and presumably                        Umm Qasr Apr 8 and 95 Some good reasons for Soviet displeasure are Iraqi choice of Boeing AC over Soviet AC large new Western investments expected to follow IPC settlement and new Iraqi policy that                        henceforth all oil will be sold for cash which is of course directed mainly                        at Communist countries6 Comment: Strategic alliance with Soviets will                        continue to be in Iraqi words buttress for struggle against imperialism                        and Zionism but Iraqis appear to be moving even more rapidly than expected                        to demonstrate their independence7 Re recurring reports of Soviet base or building of base at Umm Qasr it is                        my understanding that in judgement of Intelligence Community NIE 36272See

FOR SOME TIME GOI HAD BEEN LED TO UNDERSTAND THAT SOVIET DELEGATION TO OPENING OF SOVIET STEEL PLANT IN ISFAHAN SCHEDULED FOR MID- MARCH WOULD BE LED BY DEPUTY MINISTER FOR ECONOMIC COOPERATION.   THREE DAYS BEFORE EVENT SOVIET AMBASSADOR INFORMED KHALTABRI THAT KOSYGIN PLANNED TO COME IF THIS ACCEPTABLE TO GOI AND GOI OF     SECRET\n3.   DURING KOSYGIN S THREE- DAY VISIT HE HAD LONG AUDIENCE WITH SHAH,  OTHER PARTICIPANTS BEING KHALATBARI, SANII   MFA SOVIET DESK,  AND SOVIET NOTE- TAKER AND INTERPRETER.   DISCUSSION FOCUSED ON THREE TOPICS:  ( A) PERSIAN GULF, ( B)  IRAQ AND ( C)  DEVELOPMENTS IN SUBCON- TINENT.\n4.   ON GULF SHAH BLUNTLY TOLD KOSYGIN THAT GULF WAS IRAN S LIFELINE AND MAIN LINK TO OUTSIDE WORLD AND THAT, WHILE IRAN OF COURSE HAD OTHER CONTACTS BY ROAD,  RAIL AND AIR WITH NEIGHBORS,  GULF WAS VITAL OUTLET THROUGH WHICH IRAN S OIL AND TRADE TRAVELED TO CONSUMING NATIONS.\n5.   IRAQ E:  KOSYGIN LED OFF BY ASSERTING THAT SOVIET TREATY WITH IRAQ WAS NOT DIRECTED AGAINST IRAN OR ANY- ONE ELSE.   SOVIETS WANTED TO DEVELOP GOOD RELATIONS WITH IRAQ AND HAVE SOME VOICE AND INFLUENCE IN THE ARMS THAT IRAQ WAS ACGUIRING AND THIS WAS BETTER MANAGED WITHIN FRAMEWORK OF TREATY.   KOSYGIN ALSO TOLD SHAH THAT SOVIETS HAD AT VARIOUS TIMES URGED IRAQ TO RE- SOLVE ITS DIFFERENCES WITH IRAN.   IN ANSWER TO AMBASSADOR S QUESTION WHETHER KOSYGIN HAD PROPOSED MEDIATION,  KHALATBARI SAID KOSYGIN SEEMED TO HAVE IN MIND "" SOMETHING LIKE GOOD OFFICES ROLE"".   IN ANSWER TO FURTHER QUESTION HOW THIS MIGHT EVOLVE,  KHALATBARI SAID THAT THIS WAS NOT CLEAR AND EXTENT OF SOVIET INFLUENCE ON IRAQ OR DESIRE TO PLAY MODERATING ROLE WAS A MATTER OF INTERPRETATION.   FOR EXAMPLE,  DURING THIS     SECRET\n6.   KHALATBARI CONCLUDED FROM ALL THIS THAT SOVIETS MIGHT BE SAYING RIGHT THINGS TO IRAQ,  BUT GOI AS YET HAS HAD LITTLE CONCRETE EVIDENCE THAT IRAQIS WERE PREPARED TO CHANGE THEIR HOSTILE POLICIES TOWARDS IRAN.   HE DISCOUNTED SIGNIFICANCE OF RADIO BAGHDAD BROADCAST ON APRIL 7  AMBASSADOR CALLED TO HIS ATTEN- TION QUOTING IRAQI OFFICIAL AS FAVORING ESTABLISHMENT  OF GOOD NEIGHBORLY RELATIONS BETWEEN IRAQ AND IRAN. KHALATBARI NOTED THAT THIS WAS SAID ON ANNIVERSARY OF SOVIET- IRAQ TREATY AND MIGHT WELL BE AIMED MORE AT MOSCOW THAN TEHRAN AUDIENCE.   HE FURTHER NOTED THAT WHATEVER INFLUENCE SOVIETS MIGHT HAVE HAD IN ABATING IRAQI MOVES AGAINST IRAN,  IT WAS TEMPORARY.   IRAQIS HAD RESTRAINED THEMSELVES DURING HEIGHT OF RECENT CON- FLICT WITH KUWAIT AND FOR SEVERAL DAYS THERE HAD BEEN TOTAL ABSENCE OF INCIDENTS ALONG IRAQ- IRAN BORDER.\n7.   SUBCONTINENT:   SHAH TOLD KOSYGIN THAT HE WAS UNDER IMPRESSION INDIA WAS ATTEMPTING TO CREATE TROUBLE IN PUSHTUNISTAN AND BALUCHISTAN.   THIS WAS DANGEROUS POLICY TO PURSUE BECAUSE DISINTEGRATION OF PAKISTAN     SECRET\n8.   AFTER FOREGOING PRESENTATION KHALATBARI ADDED AS CONCLUDING PERSOANL IMPRESSION THAT IN DISCUSSION OF DEVELOPMENTS IN SUBCONTINENT AND PAKISTAN S RELA- TIONS WITH CHINA AND IRAN,  KOSYGIN APPEARED TO BE CONCERNED ABOUT A RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN CHINA,  PAKISTAN AND IRAN WHICH THE SOVIETS WOULD VIEW AS "" ENCIRCLEMENT"" AND CONTRARY TO SOVIET INTERESTS.

for Soviet fleet Abdul Baqi said Soviets are our friends They                        offer valuable aid without strings We do not accept that the treaty brings                        Soviets to this

 particularly in comparison to joint celebrations of last December At main                        celebration Apr 9 principal Iraqi address given by Minister of Health and

against no one Same phrase                        has appeared in several recent editorials Official AlJumhurriya said Apr 9 that treaty is one of friendship and                        cooperation it is not a military treaty or a collective defense treaty it                        is not directed against any third party it is based on equal cooperation                        Communist weekly

destroyers believed to be visiting Umm Qasr or Basra                        in conjunction with Admirals visit Gorshkov visited Basra and presumably                        Umm Qasr Apr 8 and 95 Some good reasons for Soviet displeasure are Iraqi choice of Boeing AC over Soviet AC large new Western investments expected to follow IPC settlement and new Iraqi policy that                        henceforth all oil will be sold for cash which is of course directed mainly                        at Communist countries6 Comment: Strategic alliance with Soviets will                        continue to be in Iraqi words buttress for struggle against imperialism                        and Zionism but Iraqis appear to be moving even more rapidly than expected                        to demonstrate their independence7 Re recurring reports of Soviet base or building of base at Umm Qasr it is                        my understanding that in judgement of Intelligence Community NIE 36272See

IRAQUSSRLowrie,frus1969-76v27d212,"1.  SUMMARY:  DOMESTICALLY,  IRAQ STILL DOWNPLAYING BORDER DIFFERENCE WITH KUWAIT,  BUT IT NOW CLEAR THAT BAATH REGIME CONSIDERS ITS TERRITORIAL DEMANDS AS VITAL AND JUSTIFIED.  SOVIETS MAY BE PLEASED, BUT IRAQIS HAVE NEEDED NO SOVIET INSTIGATION THUS FAR.  DANGER OF MAJOR ESCALATION SEEMS PRESENT.  END SUMMARY.\n2.  FORMIN ABDUL BAQI RETURNED BAGHDAD APRIL 8  FROM 3  DAY VISIT KUWAIT.  HE MADE SHORT STATEMENT THAT DISCUSSIONS WITH KUWAIT WOULD CONTINUE.  IRAQI MEDIA CONTINUE TO TREAT BORDER DISPUTE AS ROUTINE DIFFERENCE OF OPINION.  YET IT IS CLEAR FROM IRAQI STATEMENTS ELSEWHERE,  IRAQI BUILDUP OF ARAFAT AS MEDIATOR,  AND THRUST OF RECENT  CONFIDENTIAL\n3.  IT SEEMS CERTAIN THAT MARCH 20  IRAQI ATTACK WAS PLANNED AT HIGHEST LEVELS OF GOI AND THAT IRAQI OBJECTIVES GO WELL BEYOND DEMARCATION OF BORDER.  IN REMARKABLY FRANK INTERVIEW WITH BEIRUT S WEEKLY AS- SAYYAD ( NOT PUBLISHED HERE)  FORMIN ABDUL BAQI ADMITTED THAT PROBLEM WENT DEEPER THAN BORDER ISSUE AND HE DENIED THAT ANY LEGAL DOCUMENT FIXING BORDER EXISTS.  ABDUL BAQI STRESSED THAT THE TWO ISLANDS ( PRESUMABLY WARBA AND BOUBIYAN) "" ARE VITAL TO US.  ANY FORCE ON THEM COULD BLOCK ROAD TO US.  HOW COULD WE BECOME A GULF STATE IN THIS CASE?""  HE WENT ON TO SAY THAT IRAQI CONDITION FOR DEMARCATION OF BORDERS IS THAT AREA OF TWO ISLANDS BE IRAQI.\n4.  IRAQI DETERMINATION TO HAVE SOME KIND OF CONTROL OVER THIS AREA IS RESULT OF FACT THAT ITS MAJOR PORT OF BASRA CONSIDERED HOSTAGE TO IRAN AND ONLY ALTERNATIVE PORT IS UMM QASR.  UMM QASR IS ALREADY PRINCIPAL PORT FOR RECEIVING MILITARY EQUIPMENT AND MAY SOON REPLACE BASRA AS HEADQUARTERS IRAQI NAVY.  SECONDLY, IRAQ PLANS TO CONSTRUCT DEEP SEA OIL TERMINAL AND MOST LIKELY SITE IS OUT IN GULF OFF UMM QASR.  PIPELINE WOULD PRESUMABLY GO THROUGH AREA DOMINATED BY WARBA AND BOUBIYAN ISLANDS.  THIRDLY,  ABDUL BAQI WAS QUITE HONEST IN SAYING THAT IRAQ COULD NOT BE GULF STATE WITHOUT SECURE PORT IN GULF.\n4.  WHY NOW?  IPC SETTLEMENT CERTAINLY CONTRIBUTED TO IRAQI CONFIDENCE THAT IT COULD NOW MOVE.  SECONDLY,  GOI PROFESSES  TO SEE GROWING ALLIANCE BETWEEN SAUDI ARABIA AND IRAN AND FEARS THAT KUWAIT WILL SOON BE DRAWN IN TO THIS "" U. S.  SPONSORED ALLIANCE OF REACTIONARIES"".\n5.  WHILE IRAQI MOVES MAY HAVE SOVIET SUPPORT,  I BELIEVE IT IS PREMATURE TO ATTRIBUTE IRAQI ACTIONS ON BORDER TO SOVIETS. IRAQI OBJECTIVES DESCRIBED ABOVE GIVE,  IN IRAQI VIEW,  MORE THAN AMPLE JUSTIFICATION AND BAATH LEADERS DO NOT NEED SOVIETS TO TELL THEM WHERE IRAQ S VITAL INTERESTS LIE. VISIT OF SOVIET NAVAL COMMANDER IN CHIEF AND THREE SOVIET SHIPS AT THIS TIME CERTAINLY SEEMS TO SIGNIFY SOVIET SUPPORT FOR IRAQ S AMBITIONS IN GULF,  BUT IT MAY BE THAT IN THIS INSTANCE BAATH ARE CLEVERLY USING SOVIETS RATHER THAN VICE- VERSA.\n6.  SEEN FROM BAGHDAD,  THIS CONFLICT HOLDS REAL DANGER OF MILITARY ESCALATION INVOLVING CONTIGUOUS STATES.  IRAQIS ARE UNLIKELY TO GIVE UP DEMANDS WHICH,  IN THEIR VIEW,  REPRESENT ONLY WAY OF BREAKING IRANIAN STRANGLEHOLD OVER THEIR ACCESS TO GULF. LOWRIE\n",548379

25,0.7563885569972604,2400 Subj: Greek Prime Minister Confronts Serious ProblemsSummary: Greek regime in recent months has been                            unable to deal decisively and in timely fashion with variety serious                            problems eg universities and student unrest detention of seven                            lawyers without charges arrest of Professor Tsatsos of Bonn University etc At same time while                            Admiral Norton Chief of British Defense Staffs visit was exploited for                            needed positive publicity escalation of violence in Cyprus and                            squabbling within Greek Orthodox Church have cast additional doubts on                            competence of GOG leadership Rising                            level of internal public criticism of GOG coupled with heightened complaints from Greek military                            rounds out dreary picture for Prime Minister Papadopoulos Question arises as to viability of Prime                            Minister visvis his colleagues within regime Remains to be seen                            whether PM can or will exert strong                            leadership based on full implementation of 1968 Constitution End                            summary1 Prime Minister must be increasingly aware he faces problem of                            developing sufficient forward progress on the political side to                            eliminate charges of stagnation and lack of direction Early concrete                            steps to implement the 1968 Constitution could get him off the hook For                            example such concrete steps would involve the establishment of                            constitutional court and putting into effect draft electoral law                            allowing for organization of political parties as well as fixing of a                            date for elections at some distance in the future however Recent                            developments in internal situation are putting him under greater presure                            for action2 Events in recent months have not improved image of GOG Number of unresolved problems has                            increased causing embarrassment and highlighting regime inability to take decisions in timely fashion                            For example despite fact it has been clear for some time that archaic                            university administration and growing student dissatisfaction were                            likely to present problem regime failed to come to grips with issues                            posed When recent student difficulties erupted into confrontation that                            required resort to drastic measures to bring situation under control                                GOG reacted rashly particularly in                            its resort to draft and in means police used in restoring order                            Criticism produced by this affair in Greece and abroad added new element                            of uneasiness and tension in political environment3 Difficulties arising from GOG fumbling                            on student problem were compounded by untimely arrest of seven lawyers                            who were publicly identified as legitimate defense counselors for                            detained students even though there is little doubt they engaged in                            other activities considered subversive GOG refusal to receive representatives of International                            Commission of Jurists and American Bar Association while it may have                            been justified on narrow legal basis considered from internal                            standpoint was poor public relations abroad since it lost GOG opportunity to put its version of facts                            on record4 Similarly inept move was GOG arrest of                            Greek Professor Tsatsos of Bonn                            University His arrest for which no reason yet given publicly but                            Embassy understands involves his extensive contacts with opposition                            elements here and abroad came just at time that GOG discussing and arranging date for visit of German                            Foreign Minister Scheel to Athens as well as shortly before SPD Party                            Congress at which GOG must have been                            aware FRG Chancellor Brandt would face hostile critics of                            regime As result product of SPD Congress was perhaps sharper in its                            antiregime focus than might otherwise have been the case and a                            considerable cloud has been cast upon prospective Scheel visit this                            calendar year5 On other hand Prime Minister was able to extract maximum publicity                            value from visit of Admiral Norton Chief of British Defense Staff by                            insuring Norton received red carpet treatment and providing full press                            and TV coverage including prominent front page pictures of Norton                            British Ambassador and himself To some extent however question in                            House of Commons on desirability of such visits inasmuch as they implied                            support for GOG undercut PM particularly after HMG response made plain visit was military                            in character and not intended to have political implications6 To add to PMs woes

side GOG has also                            demonstrated considerable ineptitude in face of inflation meat shortage                            problem pressure for increased wages and inability to

development of considerably higher level of direct criticisms within                            country as evidenced by such publications as political themata and                            regular

lawyers and university problems                            these criticisms take on added psychological significance since they                            contribute to creation of atmosphere in which opposition groups within                            Greek society are feeling somewhat freer about revealing their own                            opinion about current situation Rising level of such critical comment                            could compel PM to face choice between                            new and genuine clampdown and present shadow of martial law posture                            that permits tolerable level of dissent reviving this area of                            intraregime friction11 The problems above have not been lost on the military who                            individually have increased their complaint level This apparently has                            allowed Chief of Military Police Col Dimitrios Ioannidis who often opts for a much harder                            line an increased voice in governmental matters through adroit                            exploitation of officer complaints It is difficult to come to grips                            with the existence or exact size of dissident conspiratorial groups in                            the Army who may have plans to seize upon this opportunity to move                            against the Prime Minister Such a move if carried out by the military                            with a view toward extricating the Army from government would probably                            receive a large majority of support both in the military and the                            population However prospects for such a move to succeed would have to be evaluated in context of                                PMs demonstrated ability to ferret                            out and neutralize Army dissidence Any new group would also have to                            take into account the views of those junior revolutionary officers who                            control the key military units in Athens and appear to command the                            loyalty of Ioannidis12 Foregoing adds up to dreary picture for Papadopoulos and his government It seems to bear out                            analysis that weakened position of PM                            visvis his colleagues within regime may be coming close to point                            where he has only slim chance to lead government constructively Various                            aspects of these developments have been reported on separately less than 1 line not declassified Added                            together I believe evidence is mounting that the Prime Ministers                            problems are substantial and that he must move decisively and                            constructively if he is to retain the balance in his favor within the                            military establishment necessary for survival It remains to be seen                            whether Prime Minister will in light of above circumstances ultimately                            grasp point that only by a strong demonstration of leadership based upon                            the full implementation of the 1968 Constitution does he continue to                            have real chance to save

QUOTE WE SHOULD BE PATIENT. UNQUOTE. \n2.  WHEN GRANT TAXED BARUTCU WITH THE HARDENING POSITION DENKTASH HAD BEEN PROJECTING,  AND HIS BACKING AWAY FROM PREVIOUSLY AGREED UNDERSTANDINGS,  DRAWING ON NICOSIA 855  IN DETAIL,  BARUTCU DID NOT BOTHER WITH DENIALS;  BARUTCU DID,  HOWEVER,  SAY THAT IT WAS NOW APPROPRIATE IN BARGAINING CONTEXT FOR THE TURKS TO LISTEN TO THE GREEK- CYPRUS VIEWPOINT,  AND THUS IMPLIED THAT THERE WAS AT LEAST IN THEORY SOME ROOM FOR COMPROMISE. \n3.  ADMITTING THAT THERE WERE DIFFERING INTERPRETATIONS OF CERTAIN KEY TERMS,  BARUTCU NEVERTHELESS SAID THA TURK NEGOTIATORS HAD ALWAYS MADE CLEAR THEY EXPECTED LOCAL "" AUTONOMY"",  NOT LOCAL "" ADMINISTRATION"". ( COMPARE WITH BAYULKEN S EXPLICIT STATEMENT TO CONTRARY.)   \n4. WHEN WE RAISED GRIVAS PROBLEM AND MAKARIOS  APRIL 15  CHALLENGE TO HIM,  BARUTCU INTERJECTED THAT HE WAS VERY UNHAPPY WITH THE MAKARIOS STATEMENTS AT THE MONUMENT UNVEILING CEREMONY IN WHICH HE REFERRED TO THE STILL CONTINUING NATIONAL STRUGGLE AGAINST THE TURK CYPRIOT REBELLION ( NICOSIA 884).  HE SAID THESE REMARKS COULD CONSTITUTE A GREEN LIGHT TO ATTACK TURK COMMUNITY.  DEVELOPING THIS THEME,  BARUTCU SAID THAT GOT  MINUTE BY MINUTE ASSESSED THREATS TO TURKISH COMMUNITY FROM VAR-  IOUS QUARTERS.  TURKS HAD CONCLUDED THAT GRIVAS FORCES WERE HIGHLY UNLIKELY TO ATTACK TURKS,  WHICH WOULD COMPLETELY DESTROY GRIVAS  HOPES FOR ENOSIS.  TURKS HAD,  HOWEVER,  DECIDED THAT THERE WAS NOW A SERIOUS POTENTIAL THREAT FROM CERTAIN OF MAKARIOS  ALLIES ( I. E.,  LISSARIDES).  BARUTCU SAID HE THOUGHT IT POSSIBLE THAT MAKARIOS,  BY ENCOURAGING THE MATERIALIZATION OF THIS THREAT,  IN EFFECT MIGHT WANT THE TURBS TO TAKE CARE OF THE GRIVAS PROBLEM  CONFIDENTIAL         FOR HIM.  BARUTCU WENT ON TO SAY THAT HE KNEW MAKARIOS WAS BOTH WEAKENED AND WORRIED;  BY WAY OF PROOF,  HE CLAIMED THAT MAKARIOS LAST YEAR HAD TRIED TO CONSULT WITH THE TURKS,  BUT THE TURKS HAD REJECTED THE OVERTURES. ( BARUTCU REFUSED TO GO FURTHER THAN THIS AND EXPCAIN DETAILS.)   \n5.  GRANT OUTLINED WAYS IN WHICH HE THOUGHT GRIVAS- INSPIRED VIOLENCE AND HIS PRESENCE ON ISLAND DIMMED HOPES FOR SUITABLE INTERCOMMUNAL SETTLEMENT AND ALSO HELD PROMISE OF HARM TO ATHENS-  ANKARA RELATIONSHIP.  BARUTCU AGREED THESE POINTS WERE SOUND ONES,  BUT HE SUMMED UP TURK POSITION AS PREFERRING TO SEE A WEAKENED ARCHBISHOP AND A GREEK- CYPRIOT COMMUNITY IN SOME DISARRAY EVEN IF THIS MEANT THAT THE ARCHBISHOP COULD MAKE NO MEANINGFUL CON-  CESSIONS IN THE INTERCOMMUNAL TALKS,  AND HE ASSUMED THAT IT DID. \n6.  BARUTCU MADE CLEAR THAT TURKS HAD NOT ASKED GOG TO GET GRIVAS UNDER CONTROL.  FROM TURK NATIONAL POINT OF VIEW,  CON-  TROLLING GRIVAS WAS NOT ESSENTIAL UNLESS,  OF COURSE,  A SETTLEMENT WAS ABOUT TO BE REACHED;  IN THAT CASE,  GRIVAS WOULD HAVE TO BE NEUTRALIZED,  IN ANY EVENT,  BARUTCU ADDED,  FOR THE PRESENT IT WAS NOT UP TO THE TURKS TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT GRIVAS.  HE EXPRESSED,  HOWEVER,  SOME ANNOYANCE THAT THE GOG,  APPARENTLY LOOKING AT PROBLEM FROM ITS OWN NATIONAL INTEREST,  OR BECAUSE IT HAD WIDER PLOT IN MIND,  HAD SO FAR CHOSEN TO DO VERY LITTLE,  AND HE REFERRED SPECIFICALLY TO PROBLEM COMMENCING JAN- FEB.  ( BARUTCU INDICATED AN ARGUMENT COULD BE MADE THAT GOG INACTION DID NOT  SERVE ITS LONG RANGE INTERESTS.) \n7. ( GREEK EMBASSY COUNSELOR MALYVIATIS,  IN EARLIER TALK WITH US THAT DAY,  HAD CONFIRMED THAT TURKS HAD MADE NO APPROACHES TO GOG ABOUT GRIVAS;  MOREOVER,  HE ARGUED THAT GOG RELATIONS WITH GOT DID NOT RPT NOT REQUIRE THAT GOG MOVE AGAINST GRIVAS,  ALTHOUGH HE EXPRESSED PERSONAL AGREEMENT WITH VIEW THAT GRIVAS ACTIVITIES COULD ULTIMATELY HARM ATHENS  INTERESTS.) \n8.  BARUTCU INDICATED THAT TURKS WERE NEGATIVE ABOUT MAKARIOS  PCANS FOR AUXILIARY POLICE BUT,  IN THE END,  IN A FORM OF RETAL-  IATION WOULD PROBABLY CARRY OUT A TOKEN EXPANSION (50  TO 100  MEN)  OF THE TURKISH POLICE FORCE.  HE ALSO EXPRESSED DOUBT THAT MAKARIOS IN ENLISTING ADDITIONAL POLICE COULD MATCH THE EXPANSION OF GRIVAS  FORCES IN THE MEANTIME ( WHICH HE ESTIMATED NOW AT MORE THAN ONE THOUSAND AND POSSIBLY AS MANY AS TWO THOUSAND MEN).   CONFIDENTIAL         TO PREVENT INFILTRATION OF POLICE BY GRIVAS  SUPPORTERS,   MAKARIOS MIGHT HAVE TO ENLIST THE COMMUNISTS. \n9.  TURNING TO REPORTS OF RESIGNATION OF CLERIDES,  BARUTCU SAID TURK EMBASSY IN NICOSIA WAS INCLINED TO BELIEVE THEM.  BARUTCU ASKED WHETHER GRANT THOUGHT M-72  PROBLEM WAS ON WAY TO SOLUTION,  AND APPEARED RELIEVED BY ANSWER THAT PROSPECTS ARE HOPEFUL.  HE AGREED RESOLUTION IMPORTANT BEFORE JUNE MEETING UNSC. \n0.  BARUTCU RAISED POSSIBILITY OF PROVIDING TURKISH WATER TO CYPRUS,  BUT SUGGESTED INTERNATIONAL FINANCING AND SAID GOT NOT PREPARED TO UNDERTAKE PROJECT ON ITS OWN RESPONSIBILITY.  ALSO SAID FLATLY GOT WOULD CUT OFF WATER IF GOC TRIED ENOSIS. \n1.  COMMENT:  THROUGHOUT THE CONVERSATION,  BARUTCU THREW OUT SUSPICIONS OF GREEK PLOTTING,  BY ATHENS AS WELL AS BY MAKARIOS.  USUALLY BARUTCU DOES NOT SPOUT THE STANDARD TURKISH THEOLOGY ABOUT THE GREEKS.  SIMILARLY,  FOR THE FIRST TIME,  HE THREW COLD WATER OVER HIS EARLIER EXPRESSED OPINIONS THAT AN INTERCOMMUNAL SETTLEMENT WITH A REVISED CONSTITUTION COULD BE MADE TO WORK,  ASSUMING GOT- GOG COOPERATION.  THE OVERALL IMPRESSION HE CONVEYED IS THAT TURKEY IS PREPARED TO ROCK ALONO FOR THE TIME BEING WITH STATUS QUO,  ACCEPTING THE PROSPECT OF NO REAL PROGRESS IN INTERCOMMUNAL TALKS.  HANDLEY\n",540445
26,0.7023517460224677,2400 Subj: Greek Prime Minister Confronts Serious ProblemsSummary: Greek regime in recent months has been                            unable to deal decisively and in timely fashion with variety serious                            problems eg universities and student unrest detention of seven                            lawyers without charges arrest of Professor Tsatsos of Bonn University etc At same time while                            Admiral Norton Chief of British Defense Staffs visit was exploited for                            needed positive publicity escalation of violence in Cyprus and                            squabbling within Greek Orthodox Church have cast additional doubts on                            competence of GOG leadership Rising                            level of internal public criticism of GOG coupled with heightened complaints from Greek military                            rounds out dreary picture for Prime Minister Papadopoulos Question arises as to viability of Prime                            Minister visvis his colleagues within regime Remains to be seen                            whether PM can or will exert strong                            leadership based on full implementation of 1968 Constitution End                            summary1 Prime Minister must be increasingly aware he faces problem of                            developing sufficient forward progress on the political side to                            eliminate charges of stagnation and lack of direction Early concrete                            steps to implement the 1968 Constitution could get him off the hook For                            example such concrete steps would involve the establishment of                            constitutional court and putting into effect draft electoral law                            allowing for organization of political parties as well as fixing of a                            date for elections at some distance in the future however Recent                            developments in internal situation are putting him under greater presure                            for action2 Events in recent months have not improved image of GOG Number of unresolved problems has                            increased causing embarrassment and highlighting regime inability to take decisions in timely fashion                            For example despite fact it has been clear for some time that archaic                            university administration and growing student dissatisfaction were                            likely to present problem regime failed to come to grips with issues                            posed When recent student difficulties erupted into confrontation that                            required resort to drastic measures to bring situation under control                                GOG reacted rashly particularly in                            its resort to draft and in means police used in restoring order                            Criticism produced by this affair in Greece and abroad added new element                            of uneasiness and tension in political environment3 Difficulties arising from GOG fumbling                            on student problem were compounded by untimely arrest of seven lawyers                            who were publicly identified as legitimate defense counselors for                            detained students even though there is little doubt they engaged in                            other activities considered subversive GOG refusal to receive representatives of International                            Commission of Jurists and American Bar Association while it may have                            been justified on narrow legal basis considered from internal                            standpoint was poor public relations abroad since it lost GOG opportunity to put its version of facts                            on record4 Similarly inept move was GOG arrest of                            Greek Professor Tsatsos of Bonn                            University His arrest for which no reason yet given publicly but                            Embassy understands involves his extensive contacts with opposition                            elements here and abroad came just at time that GOG discussing and arranging date for visit of German                            Foreign Minister Scheel to Athens as well as shortly before SPD Party                            Congress at which GOG must have been                            aware FRG Chancellor Brandt would face hostile critics of                            regime As result product of SPD Congress was perhaps sharper in its                            antiregime focus than might otherwise have been the case and a                            considerable cloud has been cast upon prospective Scheel visit this                            calendar year5 On other hand Prime Minister was able to extract maximum publicity                            value from visit of Admiral Norton Chief of British Defense Staff by                            insuring Norton received red carpet treatment and providing full press                            and TV coverage including prominent front page pictures of Norton                            British Ambassador and himself To some extent however question in                            House of Commons on desirability of such visits inasmuch as they implied

the Prime Minister Such a move if carried out by the military                            with a view toward extricating the Army from government would probably                            receive a large majority of support both in the military and the                            population However prospects for such a move to succeed would have to be evaluated in context of                                PMs demonstrated ability to ferret                            out and neutralize Army dissidence Any new group would also have to                            take into account the views of those junior revolutionary officers who                            control the key military units in Athens and appear to command the                            loyalty of Ioannidis12 Foregoing adds up to dreary picture for Papadopoulos and his government It seems to bear out                            analysis that weakened position of PM                            visvis his colleagues within regime may be coming close to point                            where he has only slim chance to lead government constructively Various                            aspects of these developments have

substantial and that he must move decisively and                            constructively if he is to retain the balance in his favor within the                            military establishment necessary for survival It remains to be seen                            whether Prime Minister will in light of above circumstances ultimately                            grasp point that only by a strong demonstration of leadership based upon                            the full implementation of the 1968 Constitution does he continue to                            have real chance to save

27,0.7003991889593634,2400 Subj: Greek Prime Minister Confronts Serious ProblemsSummary: Greek regime in recent months has been                            unable to deal decisively and in timely fashion with variety serious                            problems eg universities and student unrest detention of seven                            lawyers without charges arrest of Professor Tsatsos of Bonn University etc At same time while                            Admiral Norton Chief of British Defense Staffs visit was exploited for                            needed positive publicity escalation of violence in Cyprus and                            squabbling within Greek Orthodox Church have cast additional doubts on                            competence of GOG leadership Rising                            level of internal public criticism of GOG coupled with heightened complaints from Greek military                            rounds out dreary picture for Prime Minister Papadopoulos Question arises as to viability of Prime                            Minister visvis his colleagues within regime Remains to be seen                            whether PM can or will exert strong                            leadership based on full implementation of 1968 Constitution End                            summary1 Prime Minister must be increasingly aware he faces problem of                            developing sufficient forward progress on the political side to                            eliminate charges of stagnation and lack of direction Early concrete                            steps to implement the 1968 Constitution could get him off the hook For                            example such concrete steps would involve the establishment of                            constitutional court and putting into effect draft electoral law                            allowing for organization of political parties as well as fixing of a                            date for elections at some distance in the future however Recent                            developments in internal situation are putting him under greater presure                            for action2 Events in recent months have not improved image of GOG Number of unresolved problems has                            increased causing embarrassment and highlighting regime inability to take decisions in timely fashion                            For example despite fact it has been clear for some time that archaic                            university administration and growing student dissatisfaction were                            likely to present problem regime failed to come to grips with issues                            posed When recent student difficulties erupted into confrontation that                            required resort to drastic measures to bring situation under control                                GOG reacted rashly particularly in                            its resort to draft and in means police used in restoring order                            Criticism produced by this affair in Greece and abroad added new element                            of uneasiness and tension in political environment3 Difficulties arising from GOG fumbling                            on student problem were compounded by untimely arrest of seven lawyers                            who were publicly identified as legitimate defense counselors for                            detained students even though there is little doubt they engaged in                            other activities considered subversive GOG refusal to receive representatives of International                            Commission of Jurists and American Bar Association while it may have                            been justified on narrow legal basis considered from internal                            standpoint was poor public relations abroad since it lost GOG opportunity to put its version of facts                            on record4 Similarly inept move was GOG arrest of                            Greek Professor Tsatsos of Bonn                            University His arrest for which no reason yet given publicly but                            Embassy understands involves his extensive contacts with opposition                            elements here and abroad came just at time that GOG discussing and arranging date for visit of German                            Foreign Minister Scheel to Athens as well as shortly before SPD Party                            Congress at which GOG must have been                            aware FRG Chancellor Brandt would face hostile critics of                            regime As result product of SPD Congress was perhaps sharper in its                            antiregime focus than might otherwise have been the case and a                            considerable cloud has been cast upon prospective Scheel visit this                            calendar year5 On other hand Prime Minister was able to extract maximum publicity                            value from visit of Admiral Norton Chief of British Defense Staff by                            insuring Norton received red carpet treatment and providing full press                            and TV coverage including prominent front page pictures of Norton                            British Ambassador and himself To some extent however question in                            House of Commons on desirability of such visits inasmuch as they implied                            support for GOG undercut PM particularly after HMG response made plain visit was military                            in character and not intended to have political implications6 To add to PMs woes public image of                            Greek Orthodox Church under GOGchosen                            head Archbishop Ieronymos is in deplorable state Continuing                            ecclesiastical problems including profferred resignation of Archbishop                            must have produced considerable uneasiness among Greek public                            generally7 Escalating violence in Cyprus most of which turns upon differences                            between proMakarios and                                proGrivas Greek Cypriots                            also casts unfavorable light upon GOG                            leadership Here again image of regime and govt have seriously                            depreciated Greek inability to unify Greek Cypriot elements given its                            announced claim to lead the Hellenistic world could adversely affect                            overriding objective of maintaining strong and friendly GreekTurkish                            relationship Athens regime seems to realize critical character of                            problem it faces in Cyprus but has so far demonstrated inability to                            master developments on island rather than be mastered by them8 While grounds of revival of Vice President Agnews Drake University statement over past weekend                            remains somewhat obscure it seems clear that it was surfaced for                            governments purposes It balanced critical resolutions of SPD Congress                            and it also served to remind Greek public that GOG has important friends in US irrespective of                            hostility shown by certain European political leaders9 On economic side GOG has also                            demonstrated considerable ineptitude in face of inflation meat shortage                            problem pressure for increased wages and inability to initiate key                            economic development projects involving foreign investments10 Government has either deliberately or by inadvertence permitted                            development of considerably higher level of direct criticisms within                            country as evidenced by such publications as political themata and                            regular Greek press which have taxed GOG                            for its failure to cope with wide variety of current problems Coupled                            with publicity regarding seven detained lawyers and university problems                            these criticisms take on added psychological significance since they                            contribute to creation of atmosphere in which opposition groups within                            Greek society are feeling somewhat freer about revealing their own                            opinion about current situation Rising level of such critical comment                            could compel PM to face choice between                            new and genuine clampdown and present shadow of martial law posture                            that permits tolerable level of dissent reviving this area of                            intraregime friction11 The problems above have not been lost on the military who                            individually have increased their complaint level This apparently has                            allowed Chief of Military Police Col Dimitrios Ioannidis who often opts for a much harder                            line an increased voice in governmental matters through adroit                            exploitation of officer complaints It is difficult to come to grips                            with the existence or exact size of dissident conspiratorial groups in                            the Army who may have plans to seize upon this opportunity to move                            against the Prime Minister Such a move if carried out by the military                            with a view toward extricating the Army from government would probably                            receive a large majority of support both in the military and the                            population However prospects for such a move to succeed would have to be evaluated in context of                                PMs demonstrated ability to ferret                            out and neutralize Army dissidence Any new group would also have to                            take into account the views of those junior revolutionary officers who                            control the key military units in Athens and appear to command the                            loyalty of Ioannidis12 Foregoing adds up to dreary picture for Papadopoulos and his government It seems to bear out                            analysis that weakened position of PM                            visvis his colleagues within

    that permits tolerable level of dissent reviving this area of                            intraregime friction11 The problems above have not been lost on the military who                            individually have increased their complaint level This apparently has                            allowed Chief of Military Police Col Dimitrios Ioannidis who often opts for a much harder

large majority of support both in the military and the                            population However prospects for such a move to succeed would have to be evaluated in context of                                PMs demonstrated ability to ferret                            out and neutralize Army dissidence Any new group would also have to                            take into account the views of those junior revolutionary officers who                            control the key military units in Athens and appear to command the                            loyalty of Ioannidis12 Foregoing adds up to dreary picture for Papadopoulos and his government It seems to bear out                            analysis that weakened position of PM                            visvis his colleagues within regime may be coming close to point                            where he has only slim chance to lead government constructively Various                            aspects of these developments have been reported on separately less than 1 line not declassified Added                            together I believe evidence is mounting that the Prime Ministers                            problems are substantial and that he must move decisively and                            constructively if he is to retain the balance in his favor within the                            military establishment necessary for survival It remains to be seen                            whether Prime Minister will in light of above circumstances ultimately                            grasp point that only by a strong demonstration of leadership based upon                            the full implementation of the 1968 Constitution does he continue to                            have real chance to save

GRIGORIADES INDICATED U. S. CHARGE IN ATHENS HAD BEEN ASKED QUESTIONS BY ALTERNATE MINISTER FOREIGN AFFAIRS CAVALIERATOS WHICH HE ALSO WISHED POSE TO MR SPRINGSTEEN:  IS THERE A DRAFT TEXT OF A NEW CHARTER WORKED OUT IN WASHINGTON THAT WILL BE PROPOSED TO THE OTHER ALLIES ( OR HAS ALREADY BEEN PROPOSED TO SOME OF THE ALLIES)?   LACKING A TEXT HAVE ORAL PROPOSALS BEEN MADE OR IDEAS AND SUGGESTIONS CONVEYED TO THE OTHER ALLIES? DO WE PROPOSE PLACING SUCH IDEAS AND PROPOSALS BEFORE THE EUROPEAN ALLIES WHEN THE PRESIDENT VISITS EUROPE? IN REPLY TO THESE AND SUBSEQUENT INTERPOLATIONS BY GRIGORIADES,  MR- SPRINGSTEEN MADE FOLLOWING COMMENTS.  CONFIDENTIAL\n1.  HE SAID THAT HE KNEW OF NO DOCUMENT OR DRAFT OF A DOCUMENT.  MOREOVER THE KISSINGER SPEECH DID NOT MEAN THAT WE WERE PROPOSING THE REVISION OF THE ATLANTIC CHARTER. WHAT IT DID CALL FOR WAS A JOINT EFFORT OF CREATIVITY AMONG THE ALLIES TO REINVIGORATE THE SHARED IDEALS AND COMMON PURPOSE OF THE PARTNERSHIP,  TO BUILD A STRUCTURE OF PEACE BASED ON THE GOALS ELABORATED IN THE SPEECH.   WE ARE\n2.  THE REVIVIFICATION OF THE ATLANTIC CHARTER THROUGH A JOINT DECLARATION WILL TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE CHANGES THAT HAVE TAKEN PLACE OVER THE PAST COUPLE OF DECADES. IN A WAY THE ALLIANCE IS A PARTNERSHIP OF DEVELOPED COUNTRIES,  AND WE BELIEVE THAT THE ATLANTIC RELATIONSHIP SHOULD BE DEFINED IN A WAY THAT WILL LET JAPAN SHARE IN ITS PROGRESS.  THE KIND OF ROLE TO BE PLAYED BY JAPAN IN OUR VIEW IS CLEAR FROM THE SPEECH,  MORE ONE OF ASSOCIATION IN ITS RESULTS RATHER THAN PARTICIPATION INITIALLY IN ITS DEVELOPMENT.\n3.  PRESIDENT NIXON HAS POINTED OUT THAT THE DAY OF TUTELAGE,  OF A U. S.  GRAND DESIGN IS OVER.   ALTHOUGH NOT ENTIRELY CONGRUENT THERE IS SOME ANALOGY BETWEEN THE KISSINGER SPEECH AND THE MARSHALL PLAN SPEECH.   BOTH WERE INTENDED TO SPARK A REACTION FROM EUROPE.  WE WANT THE REACTIONS OF OUR ALLIES AS TO HOW WE CAN TOGETHER MOVE TOWARD THE GOALS OUTLINED IN THE KISSINGER SPEECH. NATURALLY WE HAVE SOME IDEAS OF OUR OWN AS TO WHAT THE JOINT DECLARATION SHOULD CONTAIN.  BUT WE ARE LOOKING  CONFIDENTIAL\n4.  THE EXACT TIMING OF A PRESIDENTIAL VISIT TO EUROPE HAS NOT BEEN DECIDED.  WHEN HE GOES,  HOWEVER,  WE WOULD EXPECT THERE WOULD BY THEN BE A DRAFT DECLARATION REFLECTING THE JOINT EFFORTS IN ITS PREPARATION OF ALL THE ATLANTIC PARTNERSHIP.\n5.  THE MECHANICS OF CONSULTATION AND THE EXCHANGE OF IDEAS ARE FLEXIBLE;  WE ARE PREPARED TO ACCEPT IDEAS EITHER THROUGH OUR EMBASSIES ABROAD OR THROUGH ALLIED EMBASSIES HERE IN WASHINGTON.   INDEED,  SINCE MR. KISSINGER S SPEECH, THERE HAVE ALREADY BEEN SUGGESTIONS THAT APPROPRIATE DISCUSSIONS COULD BE HELD IN A VARIETY OF FORA INCLUDING THE NATO COUNCIL AND THE EEC.\n6.   COMMENT;   FOREIGN MINISTER CAVALIERATOS  REACTION TO THE SPEECH REPORTED REFTEL IS LIKELY THE RESULT OF OVER EAGER REPORTING FROM GRIGORIADES.  HE TOLD DESK OFFICER HE HAD CABLED SHORT RESUME OF SPEECH AND HIS COMMENTARY TO FONMIN IMMEDIATELY HE HAD RECEIVED ADVANCE COPY OF TEXT. FROM HIS REMARKS WHAT SEEMS TO HAVE HAPPENED IS THAT GRIGORIADES IN AN EXCESS OF ZEAL AND IN AN ATTEMPT TO DEMONSTRATE TO HIS GOVERNMENT HIS SENSITIVITY TO REAL OR FANCIED SNUBS TO GREEK DIGNITY STRESSED THE POSSIBILITY THAT WE WERE PROPOSING A NEW ATLANTIC CHARTER AS SUCH ( IN WHICH CASE THE QUESTION OF GREEK MEMBERSHIP COULD BE RAISED BY SOME OF THE PARTNERS), AND WE MAY HAVE ALREADY BEGUN CONSULTATIONS WITH SOME OF THE ALLIES AND OVERLOOKED OR DELIBERATELY EXCLUDED THE GREEKS.

29,0.6087671633631114,2400 Subj: Greek Prime Minister Confronts Serious ProblemsSummary: Greek regime in recent months has been                            unable to deal decisively and in timely fashion with variety serious                            problems eg universities and student unrest detention of seven                            lawyers without charges arrest of Professor Tsatsos of Bonn University etc At same time while                            Admiral Norton Chief of British Defense Staffs visit was exploited for                            needed positive publicity escalation of violence in Cyprus and                            squabbling within Greek Orthodox Church have cast additional doubts on                            competence of GOG leadership Rising                            level of internal public criticism of GOG coupled with heightened complaints from Greek military                            rounds out dreary picture for Prime Minister Papadopoulos Question arises as to viability of Prime                            Minister visvis his colleagues within regime Remains to be seen                            whether PM can or will exert strong                            leadership based on full implementation of 1968 Constitution End                            summary1 Prime Minister must be increasingly aware he faces problem of                            developing sufficient forward progress on the political side to                            eliminate charges of stagnation and lack of direction Early concrete                            steps to implement the 1968 Constitution could get him off the hook For                            example such concrete steps would involve the establishment of                            constitutional court and putting into effect draft electoral law                            allowing for organization of political parties as well as fixing of a                            date for elections at some distance in the future however Recent                            developments in internal situation are putting him under greater presure                            for action2 Events in recent months have not improved image of GOG Number of unresolved problems has                            increased causing embarrassment and highlighting regime inability to take decisions in timely fashion                            For example despite fact it has been clear for some time that archaic                            university administration and growing student dissatisfaction were                            likely to present problem regime failed to come to grips with issues                            posed When recent student difficulties erupted into confrontation that                            required resort to drastic measures to bring situation under control                                GOG reacted rashly particularly in                            its resort to draft and in means police used in restoring order                            Criticism produced by this affair in Greece and abroad added new element                            of uneasiness and tension in political environment3 Difficulties arising from GOG fumbling                            on student problem were compounded by untimely arrest of seven lawyers                            who were publicly identified as legitimate defense counselors for                            detained students even though there is little doubt they engaged in                            other activities considered subversive GOG refusal to receive representatives of International                            Commission of Jurists and American Bar Association while it may have                            been justified on narrow legal basis considered from internal                            standpoint was poor public relations abroad since it lost GOG opportunity to put its version of facts                            on record4 Similarly inept move was GOG arrest of                            Greek Professor Tsatsos of Bonn                            University His arrest for which no reason yet given publicly but                            Embassy understands involves his extensive contacts with opposition                            elements here and abroad came just at

         PMs demonstrated ability to ferret                            out and neutralize Army dissidence Any new group would also have to                            take into account the views of those junior revolutionary officers who                            control the key military units in Athens and appear to command the                            loyalty of Ioannidis12 Foregoing adds up to dreary picture for Papadopoulos and his government It seems to bear out                            analysis that weakened position of PM                            visvis his colleagues within regime may be coming close to point                            where he has only slim chance to lead government constructively Various                            aspects of these developments have been reported on separately less than 1 line not declassified Added                            together I believe evidence is mounting that the Prime Ministers                            problems are substantial and that he must move decisively and                            constructively if he is to retain the balance in his favor within the                            military establishment necessary for survival It remains to be seen                            whether Prime Minister will in light of above circumstances ultimately                            grasp point that only by a strong demonstration of leadership based upon                            the full implementation of the 1968 Constitution does he continue to                            have real chance to save himself as leader of the government and prevent                            disgrace and disintegration of his revolutionTasca,frus1969-76v30d2,"1.

ASSUMING RESOLUTION OF ABOVE ISSUES,  NOTHING ON THE MERITS SHOULD STAND IN WAY OF PRODUCING FINAL SATISFACTORY REGISTRATION TEXT IN JUNE.  HOWEVER,  DURING LSC SOV REPEATEDLY ASSERTED LINKAGE BETWEEN AGREEMENT ON REGISTRATION AND ON MOON TREATY,  AND THEY MAY CONTINUE TO SEEK TO MAKE FORMER POLITICAL HOSTAGE FOR LATTER IN PARENT OSC. \n8.  RESOLUTION OF OUTSTANDING SUBSTANTIVE MOON TREATY ISSUES COULD PROVE MORE DIFFICULT THAN IN CASE OF REGISTRATION CONVENTION.  REMAINING MOON TREATY ISSUES CONCERN NATURAL RESOURCES,  TIMING OF NOTIFICATION OF MISSIONS,  AND TREATY SCOPE AND ITS FORMULATION.  RESOURCES MAY PROVE MOST INTRACTABLE.  LARGE NUMBER OF DELS INCLUDING USSR ( GRUDGINGLY)  ESPOUSED ITALIAN FORMULATION OF NATURAL RESOURCES AS ACCEPTABLE COMPROMISE;  WE WERE ONLY DEL WHO TURNED IT DOWN.

AS WE POINTED OUT,  THIS WOULD HAVE MEANT EQUAL PRIORITY FOR FOUR AGENDA ITEMS,  RENDERING POSSIBILITY OF USEFUL ACCOMPLISHMENT ON ANY ONE OF THEM VERY LOW. \n1.

SUMMARY.   SOVIET EMBASSY COUNSELOR VORONTSOV CALLED ON ASST SECRETARY DE PALMA APRIL 4  TO DELIVER DEMARCHE URGING THAT US DROP INSISTENCE ON INCLUSION OF ADVANCE NOTIFICA- TION PROVISION IN MOON TREATY,  COUPLED WITH GENERAL PLEA FOR CLOSER COOPERATION BETWEEN US AND USSR DELEGATIONS TO LSC.   DE PALMA AGREED THAT US WOULD CONSIDER DEMARCHE,  BUT POINTED TO OTHER UNRESOLVED ISSUES IN MOON TREATY -  ON SCOPE AND NATURAL RESOURCES.   DE PALMA ALSO BRIEFLY RAISED US DRAFT REGISTRATION CONVENTION,  EXPRESSING VIEW THAT USSR SHOULD BE ABLE TO SUPPORT IT.   END SUMMARY.\n2.   VORONTSOV,  ACTING ON INSTRUCTIONS FROM MOSCOW,  MADE STRONG PITCH FOR US TO DROP INSISTENCE ON ADVANCE NOTIFICA-  CONFIDENTIAL\n3.   VORONTSOV ARGUED THAT US ADVANCE NOTIFICATION PROVISION IS NEITHER NECESSARY NOR SUPPORTED BY PRECEDENT IN EARLIER TREATIES DEALING WITH OUTER SPACE. HE URGED THAT US ACCEPT SOVIET PROPOSAL FOR NOTIFICATION AS SOON AS POSSIBLE AFTER LAUNCH AND DISSEMINATION OF INFORMATION ON MISSION RESULTS AS SOON AS POSSIBLE AFTER COMPLETION OF MISSION.   ACCEPTANCE OF SOVIET PROPOSAL,  HE SAID,  WOULD UNTIE KNOT WHICH HAS BEEN BLOCKING PROGRESS IN OTHERWISE VERY GOOD WORK.\n4.   DE PALMA REPLIED THAT PERHAPS PROBLEM WAS THAT US BELIEVED ITS INITIAL INSTRUCTIONS WERE STILL GOOD INSTRUCTIONS AND USSR STILL SEEMS TO BE OPERATING ON BASIS OF ITS ORIGINAL POSITION.   HE ADDED HOWEVER THAT WE WOULD GIVE FULL CONSIDERATION TO VORONTSOV DEMARCHE, BUT NOTED THAT ADVANCE NOTIFICATION PROVISION WAS WIDELY SUPPORTED AMONG OTHER LSC DELS.   DE PALMA ADDED THAT ADVANCE NOTIFICATION IS NOT ONLY UNRESOLVED ISSUE IN MOON TREATY NEGOTIATION.   AGREEMENT HAS NOT YET BEEN REACHED ON IMPORTANT QUESTIONS OF SCOPE AND NATURAL RESOURCES. AFTER LISTENING TO BRIEF OUTLINE OF US POSITION ON TWO ISSUES,  VORONTSOV REPEATED STANDARD LINE ON SCOPE,  BUT EXPRESSED UNFAMILIARITY WITH NATURAL RESOURCE ("" COMMON HERITAGE"")  ISSUE.   HE AGREED TO FORWARD OUR VIEWS ON SCOPE AND NATURAL RESOURCES TO MOSCOW FOR IMMEDIATE CONSIDERATION.\n5.   DE PALMA ALSO MADE BRIEF MENTION OF THE US DRAFT REGISTRATION CONVENTION,  SAYING THAT WE BELIEVED DRAFT TO BE ACCEPTABLE TO BOTH US AND USSR AND WOULD BE SURPRISED IF SOVIETS HAD ANY SERIOUS DIFFICULTIES WITH IT. VORONTSOV REPLIED THAT LACK OF DEFINITIVE SOVIET REACTION DOES NOT IMPLY SIGNIFICANT DISAGREEMENT BUT REFLECTS  CONFIDENTIAL\n",549507

WE TOOK THE OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE A PRELIMINARY EXCHANGE WITH CANADIAN AND FRENCH DELS ON MARKING,  AND IT WAS IN THIS CONTEXT THAT THE FRENCH REP CHARVET SAID THE FRENCH CONSIDER THAT THE MARKING AND RELATED REQUIREMENTS OF THE CANADA- FRANCE DRAFT WOULD HAVE NO APPLICATION TO MILITARY ACTIVITIES.  HE SAID,  "" OUR MILITARY EXPERTS TOLD US THAT AS LONG AS YOU LEAVE OUR ACTIVITIES ALONE,  WE HAVE NO DIFFICULTY WITH YOUR PROPOSAL.""  WE EXPRESSED ASTONISHMENT AND SAID THAT THE REGISTRATION TREATY WOULD OF COURSE APPLY TO ALL SPACE ACTIVITIES,  CIVILIAN OR MILITARY,  UNLESS IT PROVIDED OTHERWISE.

CANADIAN DEPUTY REP DALFEN ( DEPARTMENT OF COMMUNICATIONS LEGAL ADVISER)  MADE SAME POINT TO THE FRENCH AND,  IN DUE COURSE,  SUMMARIZED,  IN A HELPFULLY PROVOCATIVE WAY,  THAT,  AS HE UNDERSTOOD IT,  FRANCE WOULD NOT TRANSMIT ANY INFORMATION CONCERNING FRENCH MILITARY SPACE ACTIVITIES UNDER THE CANADA- FRANCE TEXT;  WERE SUCH  CONFIDENTIAL  S TOOK UP TREATY SCOPE MARCH 30  AND FOCUSED ON BULGARIA- USSR PROPOSED REVISION OF SCOPE OF ARTICLE REPORTED BY 1972  LEGAL SUBCOMITE.

AUSTRALIAN EMBASSY ( FIRST SECRETARY MCKEOWN)  ON INSTRUCTIONS CAME INTO DEPARTMENT ( PM)  APRIL 3  TO PASS ALONG CANBERRA S ASSESSMENT OF CURRENT STATUS AND FUTURE DEVELOPMENT OF UN LEGAL SUBCOMMITTEE CONSIDERATION OF SPACE REGISTRATION ISSUE;  EXPRESS GOA UNDERSTANDING OF AND GENERAL SUPPORT FOR US APPROACH AS EMBODIED IN DRAFT TREATY;  AND SEEK US REACTION TO THREE SUGGESTED AMENDMENTS TO US TEXT.   DEPTOFF EMPHASIZED ONCE AGAIN THAT US DRAFT REPRESENTED MAXIMUM CONVENTION US COULD ACCEPT,  BUT INDI-  CATED WILLINGNESS TO EXAMINE ADDITIONS PROPOSED BY GOA.   \n2.   AUSTRALIAN EMBOFF REPORTED CANBERRA SEES THREE MAJOR  CONFIDENTIAL         AREAS OF DIFFICULTY LOOMING AHEAD IN SPACE REGISTRATION TREATY DISCUSSIONS:  ( A)  OVER AMOUNT AND KIND OF DATA TO BE REPORTED TO SYG ON EACH LAUNCH; ( B)  MARKING;  AND ( C)  REQUIREMENT TO REGISTER PARTS OF SPACE CRAFT ( BOTH INTACT COMPONENTS AND BROKEN UP DEBRIS).   \n3.   RE REQUIRED DATA:  ( A)  CANBERRA BELIEVES THERE MUST BE SOME KIND OF UPDATING REQUIREMENT TO INSURE THAT UN REGIS-    TER REFLECTS CURRENT SPACE REALITY RATHER THAN HISTORICAL FACT.   GOA SUGGESTS THAT SUCH PERIODIC UPDATING OF INFORMA-  TION REPORTED IS NECESSARY BOTH TO INSURE MAXIMUM UTILITY OF SPACE REGISTER FOR LIABILITY PURPOSES AND TO PROVIDE ACCURATE CENSUS OF SPACE OBJECT LOCATIONS WHICH GOA SUGGESTS IS NEEDED TO PERMIT SENSIBLE PLANNING FOR POSI-  TIONING OF SUBSEQUENT SATELLITES.   GOA RECOGNIZES SECTION\n4.   DEPTOFF IN RESPONSE OBSERVED WHOLE SUBJECT WAS SO COMPLEX TECHNICALLY THAT ALL FORMULATIONS OF TREATY LANGUAGE HAD TO BE VERY CAREFULLY SCRUTINIZED BY TECHNI-  CAL STAFF AS WELL AS BY LAWYERS AND POLICY OFFICERS.   AS PRELIMINARY REACTION,  GOA UPDATING FORMULA MIGHT BE ACCEPTABLE SINCE IN CRUNCH LAUNCHING STATE COULD DETERMINE IT WAS NOT "" PRACTICABLE""  TO SUPPLY ANY INFORMATION.   RE IMPACT AREA,  DEPTOFF POINTED TO SERIOUS TECHNICAL DIFFI-  CULTIES INVOLVED IN ATTEMPTING TO PREDICT TIME OR PLACE OF REENTRY AND TO PRACTICAL PROBLEMS OF TRYING TO LOCATE AFTER FACT IMPACT POINT OF SMALL METAL OBJECT IN VAST  CONFIDENTIAL         AREA OF EARTH S SURFACE.   HE AGREED TO EXPLORE FEASIBILITY OF IDENTIFYING SOME MEANS,  SUCH AS DELINEATION OF GROUND TRACE,  OF NARROWING DOWN SIZE OF POSSIBLE IMPACT AREA.   \n5.   GOA MADE FOLLOWING SUGGESTION ON MARKING:   QUOTE IN-  CLUDE A PROVISION TO THE EFFECT THAT ALL SPACE OBJECTS CAPABLE OF WITHSTANDING ENTRY SHOULD BE MARKED IN SUCH A WAY THAT THERE IS A REASONABLE PROBABILITY THAT THE STATE OF ORIGIN OF SPACE OBJECTS WHICH HAVE RETURNED TO EARTH CAN BE IDENTIFIED BY SUCH A MARKING.   END QUOTE  \n6.  IN RESPONSE,  DEPTOFF REVIEWED ENGINEERING AND COST ARGUMENTS AGAINST MANDATORY INTERNATIONAL MARKING SYSTEM.  HE ALSO EMPHASIZED SEPARATE MARKING SCHEME WAS UNNECESSARY,  RECALLING THAT ABSENCE OF ELABORATE INTERNATIONAL MARKING SYSTEM HAD NOT PREVENTED NEW ZEALAND SCIENTISTS FROM   IDENTIFYING ORIGIN OF ASHBURTON BALLS,  THUS DEMONSTRATING CONCLUSIVELY THAT COMPETENT TECHNICIANS FROM NON- SPACE STATE UTILIZING ONLY READILY AVAILABLE,  PUBLISHED INFORMA-  TION COULD SOLVE IDENTIFICATION PROBLEM.   DURING ENSUING DISCUSSION,  EMBOFF WONDERED ALOUD WHETHER SOME WAY MIGHT BE FOUND TO UTILIZE EXISTING MANUFACTURERS  FABRICATION AND CONTROL NUMBERS.   DEPTOFF THEN POINTED TO INCONGRUITY OF LAWYERS IN LSC INSISTING THAT SOME MARKING MECHANISM WAS NECESSARY AND FEASIBLE IN FACE CONTRARY CONCLUSION REACHED BY TECHNICALLY QUALIFIED MEMBERS OF SCIENCE AND TECHNO-  LOGY SUBCOMMITTEE.   DEPOFF SUGGESTED GOA MIGHT EXPLORE PARLIAMENTARY SITUATION TO DETERMINE FEASIBILITY OF HAVING LSC REQUEST S&amp; T COMMITTEE TO REVIEW MARKING QUESTION EVERY TWO OR THREE YEARS AND,  IF STATE OF ART ADVANCED SUFFICIENTLY TO MAKE WORKABLE SOLUTION POSSIBLE,  TO RECOMMEND SUCH SOLUTION FOR ADOPTION BY LSC AND EVENTUAL ADDITION TO PROJECTED REGISTRATION CONVENTION.   EMBOFF RESPONDED THAT THAT TACK APPEARED TO BE WORTH EXPLORING.   \n7.   LOOKING BACK OVER THREE SUGGESTIONS,  EMBOFF THEN INDICATED GOA BELIEVED THAT PERCEIVABLE MOVEMENT ON ANY TWO OF IDENTIFIED PROBLEM AREAS WAS NECESSARY TO DISTRACT REPS FROM OTHER AREAS WHICH ARE REALLY TOUCHY.   HE DE-  CLARED GOA HOPES THAT US AFTER SITTING THROUGH DEBATE WOULD BE ABLE TO INDICATE IT HAD LISTENED TO CONCERNS OF  CONFIDENTIAL         OTHERS AND WAS MOVING TO MEET THEM BY AGREEING TO THESE MODEST ADDITIONS.   \n8.   IN FINAL MINUTES,  DEPTOFF REITERATED US WILLINGNESS TO LOOK AT LANGUAGE SUGGESTED BY GOA,  BUT UNDERSCORED FACT US HAD EXTEED ITSELF TO MAXIMUM ON DRAFT TREATY AND THAT MARGIN FOR ANY ADDITIONS WAS EXTREMELY SLIM.   DEPTOFF THEN REITERATED POINT MADE IN INITIAL PRESENTATION TO GOA EMBASSY:   THAT US WAS UNENTHUSIASTIC ABOUT REGISTRATION TREATY AND HAD NO INTENTION OF ACCEPTING UNDESIRABLE PROVISIONS JUST TO GET CONVENTION.   HE ASKED EMBOFF TO MAKE CLEAR TO GOA THAT IF CHOICE BEFORE USG WAS APPEARING AS THE "" HEAVY""  IN LSC AND TAKING INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL  HEAT ON ONE HAND AND JEOPARDIZING SECURITY OF SOME OF OUR SPACE ACTIVITIES ON OTHER,  THERE WAS IN FACT NO CHOICE.  US WOULD CHEERFULLY ACCEPT ROLE OF OGRE.   GOA EMBOFF REPLIED HE CLEARLY UNDERSTOOD THIS US PROPOSITION.   HE THEN ADDED THAT GOA HOPED IT COULD HELP US TO AVOID BEING PUT INTO UNHAPPY ROLE OF VILLAIN.    ROGERS\n",540460

A AND B), (2)  ESSO S OPERATING POSITION AND OUTLOOK GIVEN ACCELERATED ATTACKS ON  PRIVATE OIL COMPANIES IN PARLIAMENT AND PRESS,  AND (3)  ESSO S VIEW OF GOI S REACTION TO LATEST ( APRIL 1)  IMPORTED CRUDE OIL PRICE RISE.\n2.  MALHOTRA EXHIBITED PRAGMATIC OPTIMUM LONG UNSEEN IN INDIA S PETROLEUM CIRCLES.  HE CONCLUDES THAT ESSO ( AND BURMAH- SHELL AND CALTEX)  ARE "" ON THRESHOLD OF NEW ERA IN INDIA"".  HE DOES NOT FORESEE PERIOF OF TROUBLE- FREE ENCHANTMENT,  BUT ONE OF RELUCTANT ACCEPTANCE BY THE GOI THAT A FOREIGN OIL COMPANY PRESENCE IN INDIA MUST BE TOLERATED IN SOME FORM FOR THE NEXT DECADE.  THIS MUST BE VIEWED WITH CAUTION IN LIGHT OF KNOWN GOI OIL POLICY,  BUT WE CONCUR THAT THE GOVERNMENT CAN ILL- AFFORD TO APPLY "" SELECTIVE NATIONALIZATION""  IN PETROLEUM IF IT WOULD MEAN LOSS OF GUARANTEED CRUDE OIL SUPPLIES.\n3.  MALHOTRA STATED AT OUTSET THAT NEGOTIATIONS WITH GOI ON ESSO S EQUITY- SHARING PROPOSAL ARE CONTINUING "" IN ATMOSPHERE OF CORDIALITY"",  BUT THAT FINAL AGREEMENT NOT YET IN SIGHT.  HE SAID PETROLEUM MINISTRY COMMITTEE IS CURRENTLY STUDYING DATE PROVIDED BY ESSO SHOWING COMPANY S COMBINED EARNING POWER AND WRITTEN DOWN TAX VALUE DURING LAST THREE- YEAR PERIOD ( REF.  B).  THESE  FIGURES INTENDED TO SET TOTAL VALUE OF ESSO HOLDINGS.  GOI IS EXPECTED TO REPLY WITH ITS VERSION OF VALUE WITHIN NEXT FEW DAYS.  REPORTEDLY,  GOI CONTINUES TO FAVOR 74-26  PERCENT AGREEMENT,  WITH OPTION TO BUY OUT ESSO S 26  PERCENT OVER 5- YEAR PERIOD.  IN GOVERNMENT S VIWW,  THIS PLAN WOULD AVOID NATIONALIZATION STIGMA,  BUT COULD BE DESCRIBED TO PARLIAMENT AND PUBLIC AS TAKEOVER OF ESSO.  CONCURRENTLY,  AGREEMENT WOULD PRESERVE CRUDE OIL SUPPLIES DURING CRITICAL PERIOD AHEAD;  PRESUMABLY GIVE THE GOVERNMENT SUFFICIENT TIME TO SECURE ADDITIONAL OUTSIDE SOURCES OF CRUDE SUPPLY ( IRAQ OR OTHERS);  AND ALLOW ADEQUATE TIME TO NEGOTIATE NEW CRUDE SUPPLY CONTRACTS WITH ESSO OR OTHER WESTERN- COMAPNY SOURCES IF REQUIRED LATER.\n4.  MALHOTRA AGREED THAT THE GOVERNMENTREMAINS FULLY COMMITTED  CONFIDENTIAL\n5.  MALHOTRA SAID THAT THE PETROLEUM MINISTRY IS "" AT LAST""  DEEPLY CONCERNED OVER WIDENING GAP BETWEEN AVAILABLE PETROLEUM PRODUCT SUPPLIES AND CONSUMER DEMANDS,  AND HAS URGENTLY REQUESTED ACTIVE, BUT LOW KEY,  SUPPORT FROM OTHER AGENCIES OF THE GOI IN ITS ATTEMPT TO AVERT POSSIBLE EMERGENCY.  REPORTEDLY,  THE GOI IS RESISTING IMPLEMENTATION OF A FORMAL PRODUCT RATIONING PROGRAM IN INDIA,  BUT IS FULLY AWARE THAT ALL MARKETING ORGANIDSTIONS ( GOVERNMENT- OWNED INDIAN OIL CORPORATION AND PRIVATE COMPANIES)  HAVE,  THROUGH NECESSITY,  IMPOSED RATIONING "" ON THEIR OWN"".  HE CLAIMS THAT WITH CONSUMER DEMANDS INCREASING AT 9  PERCENT ANNUALLY,  PETROLEUM PRODUCT ADVERTISING AND MARKETING IN INDIA HAS CEASED TO EXIST. HE SAID "" EVERYONE CAN SELL EVERYTHING""  AND THAT,  BARRING SEVERE COUNTRYWIDE ECONOMIC REVERSALS,  A SUPPLIERS MARKET MAY BE  EXPECTED TO CONTINUE "" WELL INTO THE 1980 S"". MOYNIHAN\n6.  FURTHER EVIDENCE OF GOI CONCERN OVER GROWING PRODUCT SHORTAGES IN COUNTRY IS REFLECTED BY THE GOVERNMENT S RECENT REMOVAL OF RESTRICTIONS ON CRUDE OIL IMPORTS BY PRIVATE REFINERIES. HELD TO LICENSED LEVELS SINCE 1971  INDO/ PAK WAR,  ALL PRIVATE REFINERIES ARE NOW PERMITTED TO IMPORT TO FULL UTILIZATION OF AVAILABLE REFINING CAPACITIES.  MALHORTRA SAID ESSO CURRENTLY OPERATING AT MAXIMUM CAPACITY OF NEARLY 75,000  BARRELS THROUGHOUT DAILY ( LICENSED LEVEL: 54,000  BARRELS DAILY),  AND THAT GOI IS ALLOCATING FOREIGN EXCHANGE FOR ALL CRUDE PURCHASES AT RECENTLY INCREASED ( APRIL 1)  PRICE LEVEL OF $2.09  PER BARREL,  F. O. B.  OIL- PORT,  SAUDI ARABIA. ( UNCONFIRMED,  BUT RELIABLE,  REPORTS STATE THAT BURMAH- SHELL AND CALTEX ARE ALSO RECEIVING FOREIGN EXCHANGE FOR IMPORTS UP TO MAXIMUM INSTALLED CAPACITIES,  AT NEWLY- SET PRICE OF $2.25  PER BARREL FOR PERSIAN GULF CRUDE.)\n7.  APART FROM ABOVE,  GOI RECENTLY ENCOUNTERED EMBARRASSING  CONFIDENTIAL\n4.5 MILLION BARRELS RUMAILA CRUDE DURING NEXT 18  MONTHS.  RUMAILA CRUDE WAS TO HAVE BEEN OFFLOADED FROM INDIAN TANKERS AT EASTERN INDIA S HALDIA PORT NEAR CALCUTTA.  THE CRUDE WOULD THEN HAVE BEEN PIPELINED OVERLAND 300  MILES TO THE GOI- OWNED BARAUNI, BIHAR,  REFINERY TO AUGMENT THAT UNI T S LAGGING SUPPLY OF DOMESTIC, ASSAM,  CRUDE OIL.  ARRIVING TANKERS WERE UNABLE UNLOAD SUPPLIES AT THE UNFINISHED,  SHALLOW- DRAFT,  HALDIA PORT AND "" IDLE""  CAPACITIES OF PRIVATE SECTOR REFINING COMPANIES REMAINED AS ONLY PROCESSING ALTERNATIVE TO GOI AT THIS TIME.  BURMAH- SHELL,  CALTEX AND ESSO AGREED PROCESS IRAQI CRUDE "" FOR A FEE"" ,  AND DELIVERIES ARE  REPORTEDLY UNDERWAY ALL THREE REFINERIES.  ACCORDING MALHOTRA,  ESSO RECEIVED\n8.  COMMENT:  MALHOTRA S "" NEW ERA""  MAY OR MAY NOT DEVELOP INTO REALITY,  BUT FOR THE MOMENT AT LEAST EACH OF THE PRIVATE SECTOR REFINING COMPANIES APPEAR TO BE FUNCTIONING IN AN ODDLY ACCEPTABLE BUSINESS ATMOSPHERE OF A TYPE NEVER BEFORE  ENCOUNTERED IN INDIA;  PROPAGANDA FOR PUBLIC CONSUMPTION NOTWITHSTANDING.  THE CLIMATE IS NOT EUPHORIC;  INDEED,  IT ISN T CALM.  THE PRIVATE COMPANIES HAVE BEEN GIVEN A GREEN LIGHT TO PRODUCE TO THEIR MAXIMUM CAPACITIES,  AND GOI- RELEASED FOREIGN EXCHANGE FOR CRUDE OIL IMPORTS IS BEING MADE AVAILABLE TO THE COMPANIES ON REQUEST WITHOUT DELAY.  HOWEVER,  THE GOVERNMENT IS CLEARLY STRUGGLING TO REGAIN THE POSITION OF STRENGTH IN PETROLEUM MATTERS IF FELT IT ENJOYED ( SAY)  TWO YEARS AGO.  THERE IS NO EVIDENCE TO SUGGEST A NEWLY- EMERGING GOI DESIRE TO PROLONG THE PRIVATE COM- PANIES  STAY IN INDIA,  OR TO ALTER THE GOVERNMENT S OIL POLICY; BUT THE PRIVATE COMPANIES ARE STILL NEEDED IN INDIA.  IF NEED PREVAILS OVER POLITICAL CONSIDERATIONS,  A NEW TYPE OF STATUS QUO MAY BE REALIEZED;  POSSIBLY THROUGHOUT MOST OF THE REMAINING PERIOD OF EACH COMPANY S EXISTING REFINERY AGREEMENT (1979-81).\n9.  THE PRIVATE COMPANIES OPERATING IN INDIA DID NOT CREATE, OR IN ANY WAY CONTRIBUTE TO,  THE GOVERNMENT OF INDIA S CURRENT DILEMMA IN PETROLEUM.  THE SITUATION EVOLVED IN PART BY THE GOVERNMENT S PREOCCUPATION OVER PLANNING FOR PUBLIC SECTOR DOMINATION IN PETROLEUM ( BUT WITH NO SUBSTANTIVE ACTION TO BACK UP PLANNING),  IN PART BY A LACK OF RESERVES OF CRUDE OIL,  AND  CONFIDENTIAL\n",549084

FOREIGN MINISTRY HAS CONFIRMED TO US THAT BANGLADESH FOREIGN MINISTER KAMAL HUSSAIN WILL ARRIVE DELHI APRIL 13  TO CONTINUE DISCUSSIONS BEGUN IN DACCA WITH INDIAN  EMISSARY P. N.  HAKSAR.  SWISS EMBASSY OFFICER INFORMS US THAT SWISS AMBASSADOR REAL WILL BE VISITING ISLAMABAD APRIL\n2.  SWARAN SINGH SAID LITTLE ABOUT THE HAKSAR TALKS OR THE INDIAN NEGOTIATING POSITION WHILE ANSWERING QUESTIONS IN THE LOK SABHA ( LOWER HOUSE OF PARLIAMENT)  APRIL 12:  BANGLADESH HAS NOT YET ASKED INDIA TO HAND OVER ANY POW S FOR TRIAL BUT INDIA IS PRE- PARED TO DO SO WHEN BANGLADESH HAS ESTABLISHED PRIMA FACIE CASES AGAINST INDIVIDUALS;  INDIA IS OPPOSED TO ANOTHER INDIA- PAKISTAN SUMMIT WITHOUT OFFICIAL- LEVEL TALKS FIRST.  INDIA IS READY FOR THESE, BUT PAKISTAN HAS NOT SUGGESTED SUCH MEETINGS.\n3.  SWISS EMBASSY OFFICER SAID IT WAS HIS IMPRESSION THAT, CONTRARY TO PRESS REPORTS,  HAKSAR WAS NOT HAPPY WITH THE RESULTS OF HIS CISIT TO DACCA.  THE SWISS CONFIRMED OUR IMPRESSION THAT INDIA IS TRYING TO DE- LINK THE RETURN OF POW S AND RECOGNITION.  HE  SUGGESTED THE SPECIFIC TACTIC BEING USED BY INDIA IS TO ASK BANGLA- DESH TO NAME THOSE POW S IT WANTS TO TRY.  BY IMPLICATION BANGLA- DESH WOULD NOT WANT THE REMAINDER,  AND INDIA WOULD PRESS FOR THEIR RETURN TO PAKISTAN.\n4.  AT A RECEPTION WEDNESDAY THE BANGLADESH HIGH COMMISSIONER WENT UP AND DOWN THE SUBJECT AT GREAT LENGTH TO NO ESPECIAL POINT SAVE TO GIVE THE GENERAL IMPRESSION THAT THEY WERE NOT THAT HAPPY WITH INDIA JUST NOW.  THE BRITISH HIGH COMMISSIONER REMARKED THAT THE INDIANS HAD "" GONE TO EARTH,""  AND THAT IS RATHER MY IMPRESSION.\n5.  EVEN SO,  ACCORDING TO WIRE SERVICE REPORTS,  MRS.  GANDHI TOLD SOME INDIAN CALLERS APRIL 12  THAT IT WAS IN INDIA S INTEREST TO GET RID OF THE POW S "" AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.""  SHE NOTED,  HOWEVER, THAT THE POW S HAD SURRENDERED TO A JOINT COMMAND IN ANOTHER COUNTRY.  BANGLAECSH HAD BEEN PRESSING FOR RECOGNITION AND REPATRIATION OF BENGALEES IN RETURN FOR RELEASE OF THE POW S.  THE SITUATION WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER IF PAKISTAN,  EVEN WITHOUT FORMAL RECOGNITION,  HAD MADE A GESTURE INDICATING THAT IT RECOGNIZED THE REALITY IN THE SUBCONTINENT. MOYNIHAN\n",547132

RELATIONSHIPS AMONG THE                            COUNTRIES OF THE SUBCONTINENT THIS UNDERSTANDING WAS REFLECTED IN THE                            SIMLA AGREEMENT OF JULY 1972 ITS IMPLEMENTATION HAS BEEN HAMPERED                            HOWEVER BY THE LEGACY OF A QUARTER CENTURY OF MISTRUST AND HOSTILITY                            PLUS IN BHUTTOS EYES THE                            INADEQUACY OF PAKISTANS BARGAINING ASSETS AS COMPARED WITH THOSE OF THE                            OTHERS2 PROGRESS TOWARD AN ACCOMMODATION CURRENTLY IS STYMIED BY THE POW                            ISSUE INDIA REFUSES TO RELEASE THE POWS WITHOUT BANGLADESH CONCURRENCE:                            BANGLADESH DECLINES EVEN TO DISCUSS THEIR RELEASE UNTIL PAKISTAN                            RECOGNIZES BANGLADESH AND APPEARS DETERMINED TO HOLD SOME OF THE POWS                            FOR WAR CRIMES TRIALS BUT HAS NOT SPECIFIED HOW MANY BHUTTO IN TURN FEELS HE CANNOT                            RECOGNIZE BANGLADESH WITHOUT PRIOR ASSURANCE THAT A THE POWS WILL BE                            RELEASED RATHER THAN HELD FOR FURTHER BARGAINING AND B WAR CRIMES                            TRIALS IF THEY MUST BE HELD AT ALL WILL INVOLVE ONLY A LIMITED NUMBER                            OF PRISONERS PENDING RESOLUTION OF THE POW ISSUE BHUTTO SAYS HE CANNOT IMPLEMENT OTHER                            PARTS OF THE SIMLA AGREEMENT SUCH AS RESTORATION OF TRADE AND                            COMMUNICATIONS WITH INDIA BECAUSE THESE MEASURES WOULD BE DEEPLY                            RESENTED BY THE PEOPLE OF PAKISTAN AS LONG AS INDIA CONTINUED TO HOLD                            THE POWS PROSPECTS FOR BREAKING THIS IMPASSE IN THE NEAR FUTURE ARE                            PROBLEMATICAL WITH EACH SIDE

ACTING ON SHAH S INSTRUCTIONS,  GENERAL TOUFANIAN,  VICE MINISTER OF WAR,  HAS ASKED WHETHER USG WOULD OBJECT TO IRANIAN SALE TO PAKISTAN OF FOUR OF OLDEST C-130 S IN IIAF INVENTORY.   PLANES WOULD BE SOLD FOR ABOUT $3  MILLION EACH AND REPLACED BY IRANIAN PURCHASES OF NEW AIRCRAFT FROM US COSTING ABOUT $5.3 MILLION EACH.   SIMILAR REQUEST WAS MADE BY GOI LAST AUGUST.   IN CONVERSATIONS WITH AMBASSADOR AND CHIEF, ARMISH/ MAAG,  TOUFANIAN INDICATED GOI BELIEVES RECENT USG "" SLATE CLEANING""  DECISIONS MAY ALSO HAVE LIBERALIZED TERMS OF EMBARGO TO PERMIT TRANSFER OF     SECRET\n2.   ADDRESSEES WILL RECALL THAT DURING PAST YEAR IRAN HAS ASKED AUTHORITY TO SELL OR GIVE PAKISTAN FOLLOWING ITEMS:  80  AP/ ARC-34  RADIO SETS,  1000  F-86  DROP TANKS,\n3.   THROUGHOUT THIS PERIOD SHAH HAS BEEN UNABLE TO UNDERSTAND HOW WE RECONCILE OUR STRONG SUPPORT FOR PAKISTAN WITH REFUSAL TO PERMIT TRANSFER TO IT OF RELATIVELY INSIGNIFICANT,  NON- LETHAL MILITARY HARDWARE AT IRAN S EXPENSE.   SHAH DOES NOT SEE IRAN S AID TO PAKISTAN AS INTENDED TO PREPARE IT FOR HOSTILITIES WITH INDIA,  BUT AS MEANS FOR PRESERVING NATIONAL COHESION.   AS READERS OF OUR REPORTS OF MEETING WITH SHAH ARE WELL AWARE,  HE IS DEEPLY AND INCREASINGLY CONCERNED WITH PRESERVATION OF PAKISTAN.   SUSPICIOUS OF SOVIET DESIGNS AGAINST PAK UNITY,  LACKING CONFIDENCE IN GOP S ABILITY TO DEAL WITH ITS ENORMOUS PROBLEM WITHOUT OUTSIDE AID,  AND FEARING CONSEQUENCES FOR IRAN OF NEIGHBOR S DISINTEGRATION,  HE IS MOVING TO BOLSTER DEFENSES ON EASTERN FRONTIER.   FROM SHAH S PERSPECTIVE IT MAKES EXCELLENT SENSE ALSO TO ASSIST PAKS IN CONTROLLING INTERNAL FORCES WORKING FOR FRAGMENTATION. IMPROVED MOBILITY AND COMMUNICATIONS CAPABILITY FOR PAK INTERNAL SECURITY FORCES WOULD BE SUPPLIED BY ITEMS PROPOSED FOR TRANSFER.\n4.   WE REALIZE THAT RECENT MODIFICATION OF ARMS POLICY FOR PAKISTAN HAS CAUSED SOME PAIN FROM INDIA AND OTHER QUARTERS CRITICAL OF US POLICY IN SUBCONTINENT. HOWEVER,  WE THINK THERE IS MERIT IN CONSIDERING WHETHER WE MIGHT INDICATE TO GOI THAT WE WOULD BE WILLING TO ENTERTAIN REQUESTS FOR TRANSFER OF NON- LETHAL EQUIPMENT ON CASE- BY- CASE BASIS.   BY AUTHORIZING TRANSFER OF NON- LETHAL,  LOW- VISIBILITY HARDWARE,  WE WOULD BOTH ASSIST PAKISTAN AND FURTHER STRENGTHEN OUR TIES WITH IRAN.     SECRET\n5.   AMBASSADOR REQUESTS THAT REVIEW OF THIS PROPOSITION BE UNDERTAKEN AMONG WHITE HOUSE,  STATE AND DOD AND THAT WE BE ADVISED OF DECISION.   AMBASSADOR RECOMMENDS APPROVAL. HELMS\n",546409

FOREIGN SECRETARY KEWAL SINGH ASKED TO SEE ME AT 1800  WEDNESDAY APRIL 19.  LEARNING THAT I WAS IN MADRAS HE ASKED TO SEE ME AT THAT HOUR TODAY. HE GREETED ME WITH THE REMARK THAT I HAD BEEN TRAVELLING. I REPLIED THAT SO,  ONE READ,  HAD HE.  THIS LED TO A HALF HOUR ACCOUNT OF THE DEVELOPMENTS IN SIKKIM. ( ACCOUNT TO FOLLOW).  HIS PURPOSE IN CALLING ME IN WAS,  HOWEVER,  TO DISCUSS THE RECENT JOINT DECLARATION OF INDIA AND BANGLADESH.  I OUGHT PERHAPS TO SAY DESCRIBE,  FOR THIS MOSTLY IS WHAT HE DID.  HENCE I APOLOGIZE IN ADVANCE TO THOSE WHO KNOW MOST OF WHAT FOLLOWS.  CONFIDENTIAL\n2.  FIRST HE RECOUNTED THE SIMLA BACKGROUND. "" WE HAD BEEN GIVEN ASSURANCES BY BHUTTO THAT BANGLADESH WOULD  BE RECOGNIZED""  IN FAIRLY SHORT ORDER,  AND THAT A "" NORMALIZATION OF INDO- PAKISTAN RELATIONS WOULD FOLLOW. SUCH MATTERS AS "" OVER FLIGHTS""  AND THE LIKE.  NEITHER OF THESE COMMITMENTS HAS BEEN KEPT.  IT WAS ALSO AGREED AT SIMLA THAT THE PARTIES WOULD NOT INDULGE IN ANY "" HOSTILE PROPAGANDA AGAINST ONE ANOTHER.""  INDIA HAS DONE HER BEST IN THIS REGARD. IT CANNOT CONTROL THE PRESS,  WHICH REPORTS OF PAKISTAN DIF- FICULTIES AND DEVELOPMENTS,  BUT WITH RESPECT TO RADIO "" WHERE WE HAVE A LITTLE MOR SAY -  ALTHOUGH ALL INDIA RADIO IS AUTONOMOUS -  WE HAVEN T SAID A LINE.""  BY CONTRAST THE PAK RADIO AND PRESS HAS CARRIED ON A SUSTAINED CAMPAIGN AGAINST INDIA, NOT JUST WITH RESPECT TO MATTERS LEFT OVER FROM THE WAR, BUT TO WHOLLY INTERNAL MATTERS SUCH AS SEEKING TO EXACERBATE MATTERS IN ANDHRA PRADESH AND INCITING PUNJABI SIKHS TO DISCONTENT.\n3.  BANGLADESH HAD VOWED THERE WOULD BE NO TALKS WITH PAKISTAN SAVE ON THE BASIS OF SOVEREIGN EQUALITY, WHICH TO THEM AT THAT TIME MEANT RECOGNITION BY PAKISTAN.  BUT "" WE DESIRE TO RESOLVE THE HUMAN PROBLEM,  AND TO LEAVE THE POLITICAL PROBLEMS ASIDE FOR THE MOMENT.""  THIS WAS ATRULY "" MAGANIMOUS""  DESIRE ON THE PART OF BANGLADESH.\n4. THE FUNDAMENTAL FACT OF INDO PAKISTAN RELATIONS WAS ESTABLISHED IN THE FIRST EXCHANGE AT SIMLA BETWEEN PRIME MINISTER GANDHI AND BHUTTO.  MS.  GANDHI HAD SAID "" LET US FIRST OF ALL TALK CLEARLY ON ONE POINT:  ARE OUR INTERESTS COMPLEMENTARY OR CONTRADICTORY. IF THEY ARE CONTRADICTORY WE CAN PATCH UP AN AGREEMENT THAT WILL WORK FOR A WHILE BUT IN TIME THERE WILL ONCE AGAIN BE WAR.  IF OUR INTEREST ARE COMPLEENTARY THERE IS NO REASON WE CAN T LINK TOGETHER WITH TIES AND ACIIVITIES THAT WILL CONTRIBUTE TO THE WELFARE OF OUR PEOPLE.""  TO WHICH BHUTTO REPLIED ""  I MYSELF WAS THE FOUNDER OF THE THEORY OF CONFRONTATION.  I NOW FIND I WAS WRONG.""  THIS MENAT THERE COULD BE DURABLE PEACE BETWEEN INDIA AND PAKISTAN.  IT SET THE TWO FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES OF INDIAN POLICY:  RECOGNITION AND DURABLE PEACE.\n",542901

                       SATISFACTORY ACCOMMODATION WITH INDIA BHUTTO HAS A REALISTIC UNDERSTANDING OF THE IMPLICATIONS                            OF THE 1971 WAR AND THE NEED FOR A NEW SET OF RELATIONSHIPS AMONG THE                            COUNTRIES OF THE SUBCONTINENT THIS UNDERSTANDING WAS REFLECTED IN THE                            SIMLA AGREEMENT OF JULY 1972 ITS IMPLEMENTATION HAS BEEN HAMPERED                            HOWEVER BY THE LEGACY OF A QUARTER CENTURY OF MISTRUST AND HOSTILITY                            PLUS IN BHUTTOS EYES THE                            INADEQUACY OF PAKISTANS BARGAINING ASSETS AS COMPARED WITH THOSE OF THE                            OTHERS2 PROGRESS TOWARD AN ACCOMMODATION CURRENTLY IS STYMIED BY THE POW                            ISSUE INDIA REFUSES TO RELEASE THE POWS WITHOUT BANGLADESH CONCURRENCE:                            BANGLADESH DECLINES EVEN TO DISCUSS THEIR RELEASE UNTIL PAKISTAN                            RECOGNIZES BANGLADESH AND APPEARS DETERMINED TO HOLD SOME OF THE POWS                            FOR WAR CRIMES TRIALS BUT HAS NOT SPECIFIED HOW MANY BHUTTO IN TURN FEELS HE CANNOT                            RECOGNIZE BANGLADESH WITHOUT PRIOR ASSURANCE THAT A THE POWS WILL BE                            RELEASED RATHER THAN HELD FOR FURTHER BARGAINING AND B WAR CRIMES                            TRIALS IF THEY MUST BE HELD AT ALL WILL INVOLVE ONLY A LIMITED NUMBER                            OF PRISONERS PENDING RESOLUTION OF THE POW ISSUE BHUTTO SAYS HE CANNOT IMPLEMENT OTHER                            PARTS OF THE SIMLA AGREEMENT SUCH AS RESTORATION OF TRADE AND                            COMMUNICATIONS WITH INDIA BECAUSE THESE MEASURES WOULD BE DEEPLY                            RESENTED BY THE PEOPLE OF PAKISTAN AS LONG AS INDIA CONTINUED TO HOLD                            THE POWS PROSPECTS FOR BREAKING THIS IMPASSE IN THE NEAR FUTURE ARE                            PROBLEMATICAL WITH EACH SIDE

THIS WAS CAUSED BY OVER- VALUATION OF DOLLAR AND TRADE BARRIERS SUCH AS THOSE WHICH EXIST IN JAPAN AND EUROPEAN COMMUNITY.   THE PRESIDENT S OBJECTIVE IS TO REMOVE DISCRIMINATORY BARRIERS AND BRING ABOUT FREE FLOW OF TRADE.  WE HOPE TO INCREASE TRADE WITH UNDERDEVELOPED COUNTRIES AS RE-  SULT OF GENERALIZED SYSTEM OF PREFERENCES. \n1.   MRS.  GANDHI INDICATED UNDERSTANDING OF US OBJECTIVES AND EXPRESSED CONCERN REGARDING ECONOMIC IMBALANCE BETWEEN DEVEL-  OPED AND UNDERDEVELOPED COUNTRIES.   EXPRESSED CONCERN THIS WILL INCREASE AND LEAD TO POLITICAL PROBLEMS.  DEPSEC AGREED THIS WAS POTENTIAL PROBLEM AND SAID GENERALIZED SYSTEM OF PREFERENCES SHOULD HELP. \n2.   MRS.  GANDHI INQUIRED WHETHER EUROPEAN SITUATION WAS WORK-  ING OUT.   DEPSEC REPLIED YES IT WAS.   RUSSIA WAS FOLLOWING POLICY OF DETENTE.   THERE HAD BEEN BERLIN AGREEMENT AND MOSCOW ACCORD WITH WEST GERMANY.   PRELIMINARY TALKS ON SALT II AND THE EUROPEAN SECURITY AND COOPERATION WERE PROCEEDING SLOWLY BUT SATISFACTORILY.   BREZHNEV WOULD BE VISITING US.   WE WERE ASKING FOR AUTHORITY TO EXTEND MOST FAVORED NATION TREATMENT TO SOVIET UNION.   WE ANTICIPATED FURTHER MOVEMENT TOWARD DE-  TENTE IN EUROPE. \n3.   MRS.

DEPSEC DESCRIBED US DISAPPOINTMENT THAT CEASEFIRE WAS NOT BEING OBSERVED.   HANOI HAD INFILTRATED MAN AND MATERIAL SO THAT IT WAS AT SAME STRENGTH AS AT START OF OFFENSIVE LAST MARCH.   CAMBODIA CEASEFIRE OFFER HAD NOT BEEN ACCEPTED.   CEASE-  FIRE WAS NOT BEING COMPLETELY IMPLEMENTED IN LAOS.   IT IS,  HOWEVER,  ENCOURAGING THAT RUSSIA AND CHINA SEEMED TO BELIEVE IT NOT IN THEIR INTEREST TO CONTINUE WAR.   IN SOTH VIETNAM,  POLAND AND HUNGARY WERE NOT COOPERATING IN ICCS.   WE HAVE SPOKEN TO THEM ABOUT THIS.   SHOOTING DOWN OF HELICOPTER WAS MOST UNFORTUNATE.   WE FEEL NONETHELESS THAT ODDS ARE IN FAVOR OF CEASEFIRE.   IT UNDERSTANDABLE THAT AT TIME OF CEASE-  FIRE IN PLACE EACH SIDE WOULD TRY IMPROVE ITS POSITIONS.  INCIDENTS HAVE BEEN DECREASING.   OF COURSE,  ALL US TROOPS HAVE BEEN WITHDRAWN. \n5.   MRS.  GANDHI REMARKED THAT LASTING PEACE WOULD MAKE A GREAT DIFFERENCE TO ASIA.   DEPSEC SAID THAT WHILE WE HOPE FOR PEACE,  RESPONSIBILITY FOR ACHIEVING IT RESTS WITH COUNTRIES OF AREA.  WE HOPE IN SOUTH ASIA COUNTRIES SUCH AS INDIA,  PAKISTAN,  BANGLADESH AND IRAN CAN WORK OUT PEACEFUL RELATIONS. \n6.   AS DISCUSSION CONCLUDED MRS.

I DON T THINK WE WOULD GAIN ANYTHING FROM A PRESS CONFERENCE UNLESS DEPSEC HAS IMPORTANT ANNOUNCEMENT TO MAKE OR PRESS SPECULATION BECOMES FRANTIC.

HIS RELATIONSHIP WITH MUJIB SINCE                            ASSUMING THE PRESIDENCY IN DECEMBER 1971 GIST WAS THAT BHUTTO HAD MADE REPEATED EFFORTS                            THROUGHOUT PERIOD SINCE THAT TIME TO ACHIEVE MEETING OR AT LEAST SOME                            FLEXIBILITY FROM MUJIB RESULTS HAD BEEN NIL HOWEVER BHUTTO WOULD CONTINUE PRESSING FOR SOME                            RESPONSE FROM MUJIB BECAUSE IT WAS OBVIOUSLY IMPORTANT FOR PAKISTAN TO                            FACE REALITY AND FIND WAY TO DEFUSE PROBLEMS IN AREA BHUTTO THOUGHT THAT SOME DENT HAD BEEN                            MADE IN PROBLEM HE WOULD CONTINUE THESE EFFORTS BUT IF THEY WERE TO BE                            SUCCESSFUL MUJIB MUST ASSIST AND INDIA TOO RECOGNITION WAS NO VICTORY                            FOR PAKISTAN IT WOULD BE FOR MUJIB AND IT WOULD BE SATISFACTION FOR                            INDIA PAKISTAN HOWEVER MUST CONSIDER THE LONG TERM IMPACT OF SUCH                            ACTION INCLUDING IMPLICATIONS FOR RESOLUTION OTHER PROBLEMS WITH INDIA                            AND PARTICULARLY KASHMIR ON LATTER IT WAS NOT IN THE CARDS THAT                            INDIA WOULD WALK OUT OF KASHMIR SO THAT AGAIN PAKISTAN WOULD HAVE TO                            BEAR THE BRUNT OF A SETTLEMENT4 THUS SOME FLEXIBILITY FROM MUJIB WAS ESSENTIAL INSTEAD MUJIB                            CONTINUED TO HARP ON SUCH THINGS AS WAR CRIMES TRIALS WHICH IF                            PURSUED WOULD AMOUNT TO                            PALM TREE JUSTICE AND WOULD BRING POINT OF NO RETURN WITH

                 AND PREVENT ARBITRARY MILITARY RULE SINCE IF MILITARY TOOK OVER THERE                            WOULD BE CIVIL WAR AND SPLITS WITHIN MILITARY ITSELF ALL RESULTING IN

NOT COME AS RESULT ACTIONS OF                            PAKISTAN BUT PERHAPS MORE FROM MISREADING BY US OF SITUATION AREA AT THE                            TIME PARTICULARLY INDIAN INTENTIONS TOWARD CHINA WHATEVER THE PAST HOWEVER THERE WAS NO                            REASON WHY US AND PAKISTAN SHOULD NOT HAVE CLOSEST OF TIES NOT A                            SPECIAL RELATIONSHIP SINCE THAT ERA

HIS PURPOSE IN CALLING ME IN WAS,  HOWEVER,  TO DISCUSS THE RECENT JOINT DECLARATION OF INDIA AND BANGLADESH.  I OUGHT PERHAPS TO SAY DESCRIBE,  FOR THIS MOSTLY IS WHAT HE DID.  HENCE I APOLOGIZE IN ADVANCE TO THOSE WHO KNOW MOST OF WHAT FOLLOWS.  CONFIDENTIAL\n2.  FIRST HE RECOUNTED THE SIMLA BACKGROUND.

SUCH MATTERS AS "" OVER FLIGHTS""  AND THE LIKE.  NEITHER OF THESE COMMITMENTS HAS BEEN KEPT.  IT WAS ALSO AGREED AT SIMLA THAT THE PARTIES WOULD NOT INDULGE IN ANY "" HOSTILE PROPAGANDA AGAINST ONE ANOTHER.""  INDIA HAS DONE HER BEST IN THIS REGARD. IT CANNOT CONTROL THE PRESS,  WHICH REPORTS OF PAKISTAN DIF- FICULTIES AND DEVELOPMENTS,  BUT WITH RESPECT TO RADIO "" WHERE WE HAVE A LITTLE MOR SAY -  ALTHOUGH ALL INDIA RADIO IS AUTONOMOUS -  WE HAVEN T SAID A LINE.""  BY CONTRAST THE PAK RADIO AND PRESS HAS CARRIED ON A SUSTAINED CAMPAIGN AGAINST INDIA, NOT JUST WITH RESPECT TO MATTERS LEFT OVER FROM THE WAR, BUT TO WHOLLY INTERNAL MATTERS SUCH AS SEEKING TO EXACERBATE MATTERS IN ANDHRA PRADESH AND INCITING PUNJABI SIKHS TO DISCONTENT.\n3.  BANGLADESH HAD VOWED THERE WOULD BE NO TALKS WITH PAKISTAN SAVE ON THE BASIS OF SOVEREIGN EQUALITY, WHICH TO THEM AT THAT TIME MEANT RECOGNITION BY PAKISTAN.  BUT "" WE DESIRE TO RESOLVE THE HUMAN PROBLEM,  AND TO LEAVE THE POLITICAL PROBLEMS ASIDE FOR THE MOMENT.""  THIS WAS ATRULY "" MAGANIMOUS""  DESIRE ON THE PART OF BANGLADESH.\n4. THE FUNDAMENTAL FACT OF INDO PAKISTAN RELATIONS WAS ESTABLISHED IN THE FIRST EXCHANGE AT SIMLA BETWEEN PRIME MINISTER GANDHI AND BHUTTO.  MS.  GANDHI HAD SAID "" LET US FIRST OF ALL TALK CLEARLY ON ONE POINT:  ARE OUR INTERESTS COMPLEMENTARY OR CONTRADICTORY. IF THEY ARE CONTRADICTORY WE CAN PATCH UP AN AGREEMENT THAT WILL WORK FOR A WHILE BUT IN TIME THERE WILL ONCE AGAIN BE WAR.  IF OUR INTEREST ARE COMPLEENTARY THERE IS NO REASON WE CAN T LINK TOGETHER WITH TIES AND ACIIVITIES THAT WILL CONTRIBUTE TO THE WELFARE OF OUR PEOPLE.""  TO WHICH BHUTTO REPLIED ""  I MYSELF WAS THE FOUNDER OF THE THEORY OF CONFRONTATION.  I NOW FIND I WAS WRONG.""  THIS MENAT THERE COULD BE DURABLE PEACE BETWEEN INDIA AND PAKISTAN.  IT SET THE TWO FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES OF INDIAN POLICY:  RECOGNITION AND DURABLE PEACE.\n",542901

         PAKISTAN KNEW THAT THE US HAD NEVER USED ITS GREAT STRENGTH AGAINST                            PEACE AND THAT IT WOULD NOT DO SO IN FUTURE11 OTHER SUBJECTS SEPTELS RUSH,frus1969-76ve08d125,"1.  FOREIGN MINISTRY OFFICIALS AND OFFICIALLY INSPIRED REPORTS IN THE APR 18  PRESS ALL PAINT THE APRIL 18  INDO- BANGLADESH JOINT DECLARATION AS A REASONABLE PACKAGE.  THEY EMPHASIZE IT IS NOW UP TO BHUTTO,  AND INSIST THAT THERE WAS A COMPLETE MEETING OF INDIAN AND BANGLADESH MINDS IN REACHING AGREEMENT ON THE DECLARATION.  THESE SOURCES EMPHASIZE SIGNIFICANT BANGLADESH MOVEMENT IN NOT INSISTING ON PAKISTAN RECOGNITION OF BANGLADESH AS A PRECONDITION FOR THE "" HUMANITARIAN""  STEPS.  THEY NOTE PREVIOUS BHUTTO INDICATIONS HE WOULD ACCEPT NON- REPATRIATION OF SOME POWS WANTED FOR TRIALS ( BHUTTO TO BLITZ EDITOR KARANJIA LAST FALL)  AND A HEAD- TO- HEAD EXCHANGE OF BIHARIS IN BANGLADESH FOR BENGALEES IN PAKISTAN ( BHUTTO TO HINDUSTAN TIMES EDITOR VERGHESE LAST JUNE).\n2.  INDIAN SOURCES IMPLY THAT THE PROPOSAL IS A "" TAKE IT OR LEAVE IT"" PACKAGE.  FOREIGN MINISTRY JOINT SECRETARY K. P. S.  MENON TOLD THE POLITICAL COUNSELOR THIS MEANT BANGLADESH WAS NOT INTERESTED IN BARGAINING OVER NUMBERS:  ALL BENGALEES WOULD HAVE TO BE EXCHANGED FOR ALL BIHARIS OPTING FOR PAKISTAN.  HE OBSERVED THAT INDIA BELIEVED THERE WERE 280,000  BENGALEES IN PAKISTAN AND THESE ABOUT COMPLETELY BALANCED THE BIHARIS WHO OPTED FOR PAKISTAN. MENON SAID HE RECOGNIZED THERE WERE A VARIETY OF WAYS IN WHICH PAKISTAN COULD ANSWER THE DECLARATION, AND INDIA ( AND BANGLADESH)  WOULD HAVE TO WAIT AND SEE WHICH HE CHOSE.   HE WAS NOT SURE,  FOR EXAMPLE,  HOW INDIA WOULD RESPOND IF BHUTTO SAID HE WANTED TO TALK PRIVATELY WITH THE INDIANS ABOUT THE DECLARATION.\n3.  MENON SAID HE DID THINK IT WAS "" EXTREMELY SIGNIFICANT""  THAT RADIO PAKISTAN HAD REFERRED TO BANGLADESH BY ITS OFFICIAL NAME ON APRIL 17  FOR THE FIRST TIME AND WONDERED WHETHER THIS MIGHT INDICATE SOME PAKISTANI MOVEMENT ON FORMAL ACCEPTANCE OF BANGLADESH. WHETHER PAKISTAN DID RECOGNIZE OR NOT,  HOWEVER,  IMPEMENTATION OF  THE INDIAN- BANGLADESH DECLARATION WOULD PERMIT INDIA AND PAKISTAN TO MOVE AHEAD ON BILATERAL ISSUES WHICH DID NOT DIRECTLY AFFECT BANGLADESH.\n4.  COMMENT:  DESPITE THE BOLD FRONT PUT UP BY THE INDIANS,  IT SEEMS ALMOST CERTAIN TO US,  GIVEN INDIAN COMMENTS A WEEK AGO ( DELHI 4128), THAT INDIA PRESSED BANGLADESH HARD FOR A SIMPLER AND MORE DIRECT BENGALEE/ POW PACKAGE AND LOST.  AT THAT IME,  FOREIGN MINISTRY JOINT SECRETARY FOR PAKISTAN,  ASHOK CHIB,  SEEMED TO SEE THE BIHARI  CONFIDENTIAL\n",543940

FROM MUJIB BECAUSE IT WAS OBVIOUSLY IMPORTANT FOR PAKISTAN TO                            FACE REALITY AND FIND WAY TO DEFUSE PROBLEMS IN AREA BHUTTO THOUGHT THAT SOME DENT HAD BEEN                            MADE IN PROBLEM HE WOULD CONTINUE THESE EFFORTS BUT IF THEY WERE TO BE                            SUCCESSFUL MUJIB MUST ASSIST AND INDIA TOO RECOGNITION WAS NO VICTORY                            FOR PAKISTAN IT WOULD BE FOR MUJIB AND IT WOULD BE SATISFACTION FOR                            INDIA PAKISTAN HOWEVER MUST CONSIDER THE LONG TERM IMPACT OF SUCH                            ACTION INCLUDING IMPLICATIONS FOR RESOLUTION OTHER PROBLEMS WITH INDIA                            AND PARTICULARLY KASHMIR ON LATTER IT WAS NOT IN THE CARDS THAT                            INDIA WOULD WALK OUT OF KASHMIR SO THAT AGAIN PAKISTAN WOULD HAVE TO                            BEAR THE BRUNT OF A SETTLEMENT4 THUS SOME FLEXIBILITY FROM MUJIB WAS ESSENTIAL INSTEAD MUJIB

NOT COME AS RESULT ACTIONS OF                            PAKISTAN BUT PERHAPS MORE FROM MISREADING BY US OF SITUATION AREA AT THE                            TIME PARTICULARLY INDIAN INTENTIONS TOWARD CHINA WHATEVER THE PAST HOWEVER THERE WAS NO                            REASON WHY US AND PAKISTAN SHOULD NOT HAVE CLOSEST OF TIES NOT A                            SPECIAL RELATIONSHIP SINCE THAT ERA

 IT WENT INTO ERA OF NEGOTIATION IT WAS NOT DOING SO WITHOUT CAREFUL EYE                            ON SOVIET AMBITIONS AND CERTAINLY NOT WITHOUT REGARD TO OUR INTERESTS IN

SUMMARY.  UPDK AND MOSSOVIET HAVE GIVEN EMBASSY THEIR PROPOSAL TO BEGIN FACADE REPAIRS APRIL 20.  SEABEE BROWN,  FBO FRITZ AND ALL EMBASSY ELEMENTS HAVE MET AND AGREED ON WORKPLAN.  REQUEST APPROVAL TO BEGIN PROJECT,  AND SEABEES, MARINES AND FUNDS TO PROCEED.\n2.  WITH ARRIVAL OF SEABEE BUC BROWN AND FBO FRITZAN ALL ELEMENTS OF EMBASSY CONCERNED WITH LONGSTANDING NEED TO REPAIR FACADE MET APRIL 17  TO REVIEW SOVIET WORKPLAN PROPOSED BY MOSSOVIET AND UPDK ON APRIL 13.\n3.  FOLLOWING ARE PERTINENT FACTS CONTAINED IN ORAL PRESENTATION FROM SOVIET SIDE ( ON WHICH EMBASSY OFFERED NO DISCUSSION AS DRECTED IN PARA 4  DEPTEL 023239):\n4.  THE PRESS THE SAME DAY REPORTED  THE LEADER OF THE ANTI- CHOGYAL SIKKIM JOINT ACTION COMMITTEE AS CLAIM- ING THAT THE RULING FAMILY HAD TRIED TO PRESSURE INDIA THROUGH THE US.  HE ALLEGEDLY ASKED THE GOI TO DENY "" INNER- LINE""  PERMITS TO ENTER SIKKIM TO FOREIGNERS AND "" ESPECIALLY AMERICANS.""  NO INDIAN GOVERNMENT OFFICIAL HAS EVEN HINTED AT ANY US INVOLVEMENT BUT PRESUMABLY THE GOI IS WELL AWARE OF THE GYALMO S EFFORTS FOR SEVERAL YEARS TO SPREAD THE SPIRIT OF SIKKIMESE NATIONALISM AMONG AMERICAN VISITORS TO SIKKIM AND ON HER TRIPS BACK TO THE US.\n5.  AS WE HAVE OBSERVED BEFORE,  THE PROBLEM OF NEPALESE MAJORITY/ LEPCHA- BHUTIA- TIBETAN MINORITY RELATIONS IN SIKKIM IS A REAL ONE WHICH WILL NOT GO AWAY EVEN WITH GREATER INDIAN ADMINISTRATIVE INVOLVEMENT IN GANGTOK.  SIKKIM WILL CONTINUE TO BE A HEADACHE FOR  WE GOI. PALMER\n",542465

I HOPE THE FOLLOWING "" CURRENT REPORT""  FROM OUR VANTAGE POINT IS HELPFUL IN RESPONDING TO SENATORS PELL AND PERCY.\n2.  WE RECEIVED A REPORT TODAY FROM AN EXPERIENCED AMERICAN OFFICIAL NOW POSTED IN EUROPE WHO WAS VACATIONING IN SIKKIM DURING THE CURRENT UNREST.  THE OFFICIAL BELIEVES THAT THE DEMONSTRATIONS BY THE NEPALESE- SIKKIMESE MAJORITY AGAINST THE CHOGYAL S REGIME,  WHICH FAVORED THE INDIGENOUS MINORITY,  WERE SPONTANEOUS,  APPEARED TO BE NON- VIOLENT,  WERE NOT INDUCED BY THE INDIAN GOVERNMENT.  AT THE SAME TIME,  INDIA HAS EVERY REASON TO BE SATISFIED WITH THE EVOLUTION OF EVENTS.  IT HAS HANDLED THE SITUATION ADROITLY IN ORDER TO INSURE CONTINUED DE FACTO INDIAN CONTROL OF SIKKIM FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE. INDIA,  HOWEVER,  DOES NOT PLAN TO INCORPORATE SIKKIM WITHIN INDIA.\n3.  DURING THE DEMONSTRATIONS,  THE INDIAN POLITICAL AGENT IN GANGTOK,  K. S.  BAJPAI,  CONFIDENTIALLY TOLD THE AMERICAN OFFICIAL ( WHO WAS ADVISED TO LEAVE)  THAT INDIAN CONCERN OVER POSSIBLE  CONFIDENTIAL\n4.  I AM DUBIOUS OF THE ALLEGED CONCERN OVER THE CHINESE.  IT SEEMS MORE LIKELY THE INDIANS DIDN T WANT ANY FOREIGNERS AROUND  SHOULD INDIAN TROOPS HAVE HAD TO OPEN FIRE ON LOCAL CROWDS. ANYWAY,  THE CHINESE HAVE STAYED CALM.\n5.  THE REST OF THESE OBSERVATIONS GENERALLY CORRESPOND WITH THOSE IN MY CABLE ON THE SUBJECT APRIL 10 ( NEW DELHI 4127).\n6.  I EXPECT THAT COMMENTS BY THE CHOGYAL AND THOSE CLOSE TO HIM WILL ATTRIBUTE THE UNREST IN SIKKIM TO INDIA.  IT SHOULD BE KEPT IN MIND,  HOWEVER,  THAT INDIAN ACTIONS AFTER THE DEMONSTRA- TIONS BEGAN MAY WELL HAVE SAVED THE POSITION OF THE CHOGYAL. FROM WHAT WE CAN GATHER HERE,  THE INDIAN GOVERNMENT HOPES TO MAINTAIN THE CHOGYAL AS TITULAR HEAD OF SIKKIM.  HE SERVES AS A CONTROL OF SORTS ON THE LEPCHA AND BHUTIA MINORITY. THE INDIANS DON T WANT TO RISK ANOTHER MIZO OR NAGA SITUATION WHICH THE CHINESE MIGHT IN THE FUTURE PLAY WITH.  THE INDIANS HAVE HAD THEIR DIFFERENCES WITH THE CHOGYAL FOR A LONG TIME.  I WOULD HOPE,  HOWEVER,  THAT SENATOR PELL WOULD NOT TAKE AT FACE VALUE ALL THE CHARGES AGAINST INDIA WHICH MAY BE MADE BY THE CHOGYAL AND HIS FAMILY.\n7.  I AGREE ENTIRELY WITH YOUR JUDGMENT THAT IT WOULD NOT BE IN OUR INTEREST TO ASK THE INDIAN GOVERNMENT TO LET US SEND AN EMBASSY REPRESENTATIVE TO SIKKIM AT THIS TIME.  PERHAPS IN A FEW MONTHS,  WHEN THE SITUATION IN SIKKIM HAS SETTLED DOWN AND SOME PROGRESS HAS BEEN MADE IN WORKING OUR A COMPROMISE ACCEPTABLE TO THE CONFLICTING ROUPS IN SIKKIM,  SENDING AN EMBASSY OFFICER MIGHT BE A SENSIBLE THING FOR US TO TRY AND DO. AT PRESENT I BELIEVE IT IS NOT.\n8.  I WILL BE SENDING BY SEPARATE CABLE ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON SIKKIM.  IT IS NOT MUCH,  BUT IS IS ALL THAT WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO GATHER FROM SOURCES AVAILABLE TO US HERE IN NEW DELHI. MOYNIHAN\n",547135

DE WARREN CITED RECENT TRIPOLI VISIT OF SADAT AS MOST RECENT EVIDENCE OF COOLING OF RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN TWO COUNTRIES.

FURTHER,  KAZI LENDHUP HAS ANNOUNCED "" SUSPENSION""  OF AGITATION AND ASKED HIS SUPOORTERS FULLY COOPERATE WITH GOI. \n3.   ALL LOCAL ABOSERVERS AGREE THAT GOI HAVING NEW TAKEN OVER CIVIL ADMINISTRATION OF SIKKIM WILL BE INVOLVED FOR SOME TIME IN TICKLISH PROBLEM OF SORTING OUT RIVAL LOCAL CLAIMS WHILE KEEPING IN MIND IS IMPORTANT SECURITY CONCERNS IN AREA.   IT FACES DLIEMMA IN IRONIC FACT THAT CHASTENED CHOGYAL WILL BE EASIER TO DEAL WITH THAN AGRESSIVE NEPALI YOUTH WHO FORM BULK OF SIKKIM ASTRYA CONGRESS ( OF KAZI LENDHUP)  AND OF JANATA CONGRESS/ STATE CONGRESS (  OF K.

DARJEELING FACTOR:   A.   ETHNIC TENSIONS:   WE UNDERSTAND FROM GAJENDRA GURUNG,  GOWB DEPUTY MINISTER AND ONLY REPRESENTATIVE OF NEPALI- DOMINATED DARJEELING DISTRICT IN WEST BENGAL CABINE,  THAT IMMEDIATE GOWB CONCERN WAS FOR WELFARE OF TIBETAN ( BHUTIA)  MINORITY IN DARJEELING AS REPORTS OF CHOGYAL S ARMING OF BHUTIA REFUGEE GROUPS IN ORDER TO ATTACH NEPALIS BEGAN TO APPEAR IN INDIAN PRESS.   ONE HARUM- SCARUM STORY OF CROWN PRINCE TENZING GOING ON ANTI- NEPALI SHOOTING SPREE IN GANGTOK BAZAR RESULTED IN LARGE- SCALE YOUTH CONGRESS DEMONSTRATIONS IN LAKIMPONG,  DARJEELING AND KURSEONG TOWNS.   THIS  COMMUNAL  DANGER SEEMS TO HAVE PASSED,  ALTHOUGH TIBETANS,  PARTICULARLY BECAUSE OF THEIR FINANCIAL SUCCESS IN PAST TEN YEARS IN CONTRAST TO GENERALLY POOR NEPALIS,  ARE UNPOPULAR AND STILL POTENTIAL TARGETS.

KAZI LENDHUP S ADOPTED SON,  NAR BAHADUR KATHIAWAD IS CHAIRMAN,  SIKKIM YOUTH CONGRESS.   ABOUT 26,  KATHIAWAD IS THRID YEAR STUDENT IN KALIMPONG COLLEGE AND DESPITE HIS RELATIONSHIP TO KAZI,  IS CONSIDERED EXTREMELY AMBITIOUS AND,  LIKE MOST OF THE YOUTH INVOLVED,  COMMITED TO NEPALI ADMINISTRATION OF SIKKIM( I. E.,  WITHOUTH CHOGYAL AND,  IF NECESSARY WE UNDERSTAND,  WITHOUT KAZI).    SECOND IMPORTANT YOUNG LEADER IS 29- YEAR OLD K. C.  PARADHAN,  LEADER OF ANATA CONGRESS/ STATE CONGRESS,  WHOSE ARREST BY CHOGYAL PRE-  CIPITATED RECENT DEMONSTRATIONS.   THESE POLITICOES HAVE GROWN UP IN ATMOSPHERE WHICH VIEWED GOI ( IN FORM INDIAN ARMY)  AS MAIN PROP OF FEUDAL CHOGYAL (  THIS DESPITE FACT CHOGYAL HIMSELF USUALLYCRITICAL, \n6.

COMMENT:   PERHAPS WORTH REITERATING THAT WE THUS FAR HAVE ONLY GOI VERSION OF EVENTS OF PAST WEEK IN SIKKIM,   WE HAVE IMPRESSION THAT GOI AT FIRST NOT AVERSE TO NEPALI DEMONSTRATIONS/  PRESSURE ON CHOGYAL,  BUT BECAME WORRIED AS THINGS RAPIDLY GOT OUT OF HAND.

Bandaranaikes Coalition                            Government flounders about in struggle to find solutions to economic                            ills while caught in constraints of doctrinaire Marxist thinking USSri                            Lanka relations have improved significantly since initial period in 1970                            when Mrs Bandaranaikes election                            victory led to foreign affairs steps unfriendly to US Some differences                            remain such as GSLs unhelpful attitude                            on terrorism and its sponsorship of Indian Ocean Peace Zone                            Nevertheless this Government is probably best that can be expected                            under current circumstances and should continue be supported2 Political Situation: Present Government is in trouble General                            election in 1970 gave United Front coalition of Sri Lanka Freedom Party                            SLFP Trotskyite Lanka Sama Samaja Party LSSP and Communist Party                            Moscow CPM more than twothirds majority in parliament based on                            voters expectation it would deliver on extravagant socialistic election                            promises Government has not carried through now recognizing that many                            of promised measures would contribute to economic disorder Meanwhile                            radical left within coalition continues call for full implementation of                            Election Manifesto and internal pressures increase within Coalition and                            within each party in coalition3 Internal cohesiveness of nationalistic socialistic SLFP Prime                            Ministers party is itself in question for substantial number of MPs especially backbenchers                            but also including several Cabinet Ministers are closely identified                            with radical left Most MPs however realize that defections would                            lead to new elections which no one believes present constellation of                            forces could win4 Opposition United National Party UNP of Dudley Senanayake which                            suffered crushing defeat in 1970 has now begun vigorous campaign                            against Government pointing to economic difficulties into which Sri                            Lanka has fallen5 Further complicating foregoing political struggle which basically                            takes place among members Singhalese majority is prospect communal                            struggle with Tamils who form large minority in Sri Lanka6 New Left insurrection of 1971 was virtually crushed in about six                            weeks though it came within hairs breadth of succeeding despite                            leaders somewhat naive anarchist approach Scattered insurgent bands                            probably no more than 400 individuals still exist leaders are now on                            trial and between 3000 and 5000 participants are still in prison                            Insurrection seems to have been unique event unlikely to be repeated                            here and unlikely carry lesson for elsewhere It has had continuing                            disruptive effect however of heightening internal pressures in all                            established parties often along lines of generation gap Younger                            more radical members of these parties have found sympathizers in own age group across party lines                            and clash with older politicians in respective parties who no longer are                            considered proponents of true line Insurrection also served to focus                            attention on problems of youth in increasingly youthful nation but                            significant action is still lacking7 In sum PM Bankaranaikes Government                            has become unpopular and faces opposition from without and within as it                            struggles cope with crushing economic burdens which are at bottom of                            many of political problems8 Economic situation: Sri Lankas economy has long been troubled by                            combination of domestic and international forces that have imposed                            rigorous constraints on growth Continuing balance of payments and                            recurrent budgetary deficits have contributed to prolonged economic                            crisis and severely limited scope for new initiatives One example of                            hardships caused by external factors is expected increase of 46 million                            in major food imports bill alone this year because of rise in world                            prices Situation further complicated by mounting unemployment and                            rising domestic price levels9 Thrust of Government economic policies should be to stimulate                            production and encourage domestic savings while discouraging unneeded                            imports and limiting sharply Government spending on social welfare                            services Because of steep political price GSL considers it would have                            to pay however it has taken only limited action and that reluctantly                                First GSL budget 1970 did reduce marginally the                            rate of increase on social welfare expenditures but increased overall                            spending sharply and measures which acted as severe disincentive to                            private sector expansion and investment As result GNP growth rate was                            only 9 percent in 1971 and 25 percent in 1972 Overall picture remains                            generally bleak although there has been some revival of private                            investment and some commendable reforms have been introduced by                            Government despite considerable political risk such as subsidy cuts                            affecting flour sugar petroleum products and textiles However any                            significant capital expenditure for public investment and foreign                            exchange requirements will continue to depend heavily on foreign                            assistance10 Recent Aid Ceylon Group meeting in Paris brought pledges of 5565                            million for upcoming year

present output for 1973 and could lay                            basis for future expansion provided GSL                            pursues measures haltingly begun toward reduction in subsidies and                            overly generous welfare schemes Sri Lanka cannot possibly afford11 US Commercial Interest: Business relationships between US and Sri                            Lanka are small and diminishing Minuscule market dominated by traditional trading partners is becoming                            less attractive as local economy shrinks imports are curtailed and

aid Army and                            Air Force have improved capability but Navy still ineffectual Sri Lanka                            military can probably handle any indigenous threat if no outside                            assistance in training and arms is given to potential insurgents                            Foreign military influence is primarily from Commonwealth with                            increased training in Asian states Prime Minister apparently wishes                            avoid military training abroad by big powers and therefore utilizes

were active sympathizers of rebels in 1971 Nevertheless direct                            military involvement in politics is unlikely because no potential leader                            is visible and basic disorganization of military establishment would                            probably spell failure if coup were ever attempted14 Foreign Policy: Though Prime Minister Bandaranaike actions considers herself a pillar of                            nonaligned world her actions as distinct from avowed policy are                            increasingly pragmatic influenced by such factors as altered regional                            power balance and need of economic assistance Because of continued                            suspicions of Indias motives particularly since signing of

with increasingly adverse terms of                            international trade Sri Lanka is also experiencing growing political problems as Prime Minister                                Bandaranaikes Coalition                            Government flounders about in struggle to find solutions to economic                            ills while caught in constraints of doctrinaire Marxist thinking USSri                            Lanka relations have improved significantly since initial period in 1970                            when Mrs Bandaranaikes election                            victory led to foreign affairs steps unfriendly to US Some differences                            remain such as GSLs unhelpful attitude                            on terrorism and its sponsorship of Indian Ocean Peace Zone                            Nevertheless this Government is probably best that can be expected                            under current circumstances and should continue be supported2 Political Situation: Present Government is in trouble General                            election in 1970 gave United Front coalition of Sri Lanka Freedom Party                            SLFP Trotskyite Lanka Sama Samaja Party LSSP and Communist Party                            Moscow CPM more than twothirds majority in parliament based on                            voters expectation it would deliver on extravagant socialistic election                            promises Government has not carried through now recognizing that many                            of promised measures would contribute to economic disorder Meanwhile                            radical left within coalition continues call for full implementation of                            Election Manifesto and internal pressures increase within Coalition and                            within each party in coalition3 Internal cohesiveness of nationalistic socialistic SLFP Prime                            Ministers party is itself in question for substantial number of MPs especially backbenchers                            but also including several Cabinet Ministers are closely identified                            with radical left Most MPs however realize that defections would                            lead to new elections which no one believes present constellation of                            forces could win4 Opposition United National Party UNP of Dudley Senanayake which                            suffered crushing defeat in 1970 has now begun vigorous campaign                            against Government pointing to economic difficulties into which Sri                            Lanka has fallen5 Further complicating foregoing political struggle which basically                            takes place among members Singhalese majority is prospect communal                            struggle with Tamils who form large minority in Sri Lanka6 New Left insurrection of 1971 was virtually crushed in about six                            weeks though it came within hairs breadth of succeeding despite                            leaders somewhat naive anarchist approach Scattered insurgent bands                            probably no more than 400 individuals still exist leaders are now on                            trial and between 3000 and 5000 participants are still in prison                            Insurrection seems to have been unique event unlikely to be repeated                            here and unlikely carry lesson for elsewhere It has had continuing                            disruptive effect however of heightening internal pressures in all                            established parties often along lines of generation gap Younger                            more radical members of these parties have found sympathizers in own age group across party lines                            and clash with older politicians in respective parties who no longer are                            considered proponents of true line Insurrection also served to focus                            attention on problems of youth in increasingly youthful nation but                            significant action is still lacking7 In sum PM Bankaranaikes Government                            has become unpopular and faces opposition from without and within as it                            struggles cope with crushing economic burdens which are at bottom of                            many of political problems8 Economic situation: Sri Lankas economy has long been troubled by                            combination of domestic and international forces that have imposed                            rigorous constraints on growth Continuing balance of payments and                            recurrent budgetary deficits have contributed to prolonged economic                            crisis and severely limited scope for new initiatives One example of                            hardships caused by external factors is expected increase of 46 million                            in major food imports bill alone this year because of rise in world                            prices Situation further complicated by mounting unemployment and                            rising domestic price levels9 Thrust of Government economic policies

social welfare                            services Because of steep political price GSL considers it would have                            to pay however it has taken only limited action and that reluctantly                                First GSL budget 1970 did reduce marginally the                            rate of increase on social welfare expenditures but increased overall                            spending sharply and measures which acted as severe disincentive to                            private sector expansion and investment As result GNP growth rate was

          against Government pointing to economic difficulties into which Sri                            Lanka has fallen5 Further complicating foregoing political struggle which basically                            takes place among members Singhalese majority is prospect communal                            struggle with Tamils who form large minority in Sri Lanka6 New Left insurrection of 1971 was virtually crushed in about six                            weeks though it came within hairs breadth of succeeding despite                            leaders somewhat naive anarchist approach Scattered insurgent bands                            probably no more than 400 individuals still exist leaders are now on                            trial and between 3000 and 5000 participants are

youthful nation but                            significant action is still lacking7 In sum PM Bankaranaikes Government                            has become unpopular and faces opposition from without and within as it                            struggles cope with crushing economic burdens which are at bottom of                            many of political problems8 Economic situation: Sri Lankas economy has long been troubled by                            combination of domestic and international forces that have imposed                            rigorous constraints on growth Continuing balance of payments and                            recurrent budgetary deficits have contributed to prolonged economic                            crisis and severely limited scope for new initiatives One example of                            hardships caused by external factors is expected increase of 46 million                            in major food imports bill alone this year because of rise in world                            prices Situation further complicated by mounting unemployment and                            rising domestic price levels9 Thrust of Government economic policies should be to stimulate                            production and encourage domestic savings while discouraging unneeded                            imports and limiting sharply Government spending on social welfare                            services Because of steep political price GSL considers it would have                            to pay however it has taken only limited action and that reluctantly                                First GSL budget 1970 did reduce marginally the                            rate of increase on social welfare expenditures but increased overall                            spending sharply and measures which acted as severe disincentive to                            private sector expansion and investment As result GNP growth rate was                            only 9 percent in 1971 and 25 percent in 1972 Overall picture remains                            generally bleak although there has been some revival of private                            investment and some commendable reforms have been introduced by                            Government despite considerable political risk such as subsidy cuts                            affecting flour sugar petroleum products and textiles However any                            significant capital expenditure for public investment and foreign                            exchange requirements will continue to depend heavily on foreign                            assistance10 Recent Aid Ceylon Group meeting in Paris brought pledges of 5565                            million for upcoming year US contribution being 1518 million in PL                            480 wheat flout subject to availability both funds and flour Current                            aid level should hold economy at present output for 1973 and could lay                            basis for future expansion provided GSL                            pursues measures haltingly begun toward reduction in subsidies and                            overly generous welfare schemes Sri Lanka cannot possibly afford11 US Commercial Interest: Business relationships between US and Sri                            Lanka are small and diminishing Minuscule market dominated by traditional trading partners is becoming                            less attractive as local economy shrinks imports are curtailed and                            socialism discourages private enterprise12 Military: Since infusion foreign military assistance after April 1971                            insurgency US provided 3 million in grant military aid Army and                            Air Force have improved capability but Navy still ineffectual Sri Lanka                            military can probably handle any indigenous threat if no outside                            assistance in training and arms is given to potential insurgents                            Foreign military influence is primarily from Commonwealth with                            increased training in Asian states Prime Minister apparently wishes                            avoid military training abroad by big powers and therefore utilizes                            special relationship with Commonwealth nations for Sri Lankas                            needs13 Military are subject to same stresses as civilian population and some                            were active sympathizers of rebels in 1971 Nevertheless direct                            military involvement in politics is unlikely because no potential leader                            is visible and basic disorganization of military establishment would                            probably spell failure if coup were ever attempted14 Foreign Policy: Though Prime Minister Bandaranaike actions considers herself a pillar of                            nonaligned world her actions as distinct from avowed policy are                            increasingly pragmatic influenced by such factors as altered regional                            power balance and need of economic assistance Because of continued                            suspicions of Indias motives particularly since signing of IndoSoviet                            pact and Indian invasion of East Pakistan in 1971 GSL has drawn closer to PRC and to lesser                            degree to US15 GSLUS relations are good                            improvement resulting from US material assistance following the                            insurrection Ceylonese perception of the need to adjust to shifting                            power balances in Asia and US lead in Aid Group One manifestation of                            new footing was silence which GSL                            maintained throughout crucial period of President Nixons efforts wind down VietNam war                            last December Another is tacit virtual abandonment of nonnuclear                            declaration policy US Navy ships and US military aircraft can visit                            Sri Lanka despite GSL espousal of Indian                            Ocean Peace Zone While US Sri Lanka relations are thus markedly                            better than when Mrs Bandaranaikes Government took office in 1970 when Peace                            Corps was terminated Asia Foundation ousted and Communist

youthful nation but                            significant action is still lacking7 In sum PM Bankaranaikes Government                            has become unpopular and faces opposition from without and within as it                            struggles cope with crushing economic burdens which are at bottom of                            many of political problems8 Economic situation: Sri Lankas economy has long been troubled by                            combination of domestic and international forces that have imposed                            rigorous constraints on growth Continuing balance of payments and                            recurrent budgetary deficits have contributed to prolonged economic                            crisis and severely limited scope for new initiatives One example of                            hardships caused by external factors is expected increase of 46 million                            in major food imports bill alone this year because of rise in world                            prices Situation further complicated by mounting unemployment and                            rising domestic price levels9 Thrust of Government economic policies should be to stimulate                            production and encourage domestic savings while discouraging unneeded                            imports and limiting sharply Government spending on social welfare                            services Because of steep political price GSL considers it would have                            to pay however it has taken only limited action and that reluctantly                                First GSL budget 1970 did reduce marginally the                            rate of increase on social welfare expenditures but increased overall                            spending sharply and measures which acted as severe disincentive to                            private sector expansion and investment As result GNP growth rate was                            only 9 percent in 1971 and 25 percent in 1972 Overall picture remains                            generally bleak although there has been some revival of private                            investment and some commendable reforms have been introduced by                            Government despite considerable political risk such as subsidy cuts                            affecting flour sugar petroleum products and textiles However any                            significant capital expenditure for public investment and foreign                            exchange requirements will continue to depend heavily on foreign                            assistance10 Recent Aid Ceylon Group meeting in Paris brought pledges of 5565                            million for upcoming year

                         overly generous welfare schemes Sri Lanka cannot possibly afford11 US Commercial Interest: Business relationships between US and Sri                            Lanka are small and diminishing Minuscule market dominated by traditional trading partners is becoming                            less attractive as local economy shrinks imports are curtailed and

aid Army and                            Air Force have improved capability but Navy still ineffectual Sri Lanka                            military can probably handle any indigenous threat if no outside                            assistance in training and arms is given to potential insurgents                            Foreign military influence is primarily from Commonwealth with                            increased training in Asian states Prime Minister apparently wishes                            avoid military training abroad by big powers and therefore utilizes

were active sympathizers of rebels in 1971 Nevertheless direct                            military involvement in politics is unlikely because no potential leader                            is visible and basic disorganization of military establishment would                            probably spell failure if coup were ever attempted14 Foreign Policy: Though Prime Minister Bandaranaike actions considers herself a pillar of                            nonaligned world her actions as distinct from avowed policy are                            increasingly pragmatic influenced by such factors as altered regional                            power balance and need of economic assistance Because of continued                            suspicions of Indias motives particularly since signing of

Navy ships and US military aircraft can visit                            Sri Lanka despite GSL espousal of Indian                            Ocean Peace Zone While US Sri Lanka relations are thus markedly                            better than when Mrs Bandaranaikes Government took office in 1970 when Peace                            Corps was terminated Asia Foundation ousted and Communist

Indian                            Ocean Peace Zone proposal has caused problems for US in UN but is one of importance to Prime                            Ministers claim to be leader in nonaligned world and has attracted                            increasing support among UN members                            Failure of GSL to support US on                            terrorism issue at UN last

Marxist thinking USSri                            Lanka relations have improved significantly since initial period in 1970                            when Mrs Bandaranaikes election                            victory led to foreign affairs steps unfriendly to US Some differences                            remain such as GSLs unhelpful attitude                            on terrorism and its

AS REQUESTED REFTEL EMBOFF SAW ASSISTANT SECRETARY MICHAEL COOK APRIL 13  AND MADE PRESENTATION ALONG LINES REF B.   BEFORE SEEING COOK,  EMBOFF TALKED WITH COUNSELLOR OF REPUBLIC OF KOREA EMBASSY IN CANBERRA,  RO MYUNG GONG,  AND REPEATED ARGUMENTS GIVEN REF B.  GONG,  SAID SOUTH KOREAN  AMBASSADOR MIN HAD SEEN SECRETARY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS WALLER APRIL 12  ON SAME SUBJECT.   ACCORDING TO GONG,  AMBASSADOR HAS BEEN TOLD BY WALLER THAT SUBJECT HAS BEEN PRESENTED TO PRIME MINISTER WHITLAM BUT THAT DECISION OF WHETHER TO SUPPORT DELAY IN CONSIDERATION OF NORTH KOREA S APPLICATION FOR WHO MEMBERSHIP AT WHA MEETING HAD NOT BEEN MADE.   GONG INDICATED AMBASSADOR HAD NOT BEEN ABLE TO GET ANY INDICATION OF WHAT RECOMMENDATION FDS HAD MADE TO PRIME MINISTER.   GONG SAID HE HIMSELF HAS BEEN TO SEE COOK THREE TIMES IN PAST TEN DAYS ON MATTER.\n2.   COOK GAVE EMBOFF SAME RESPONSE GIVEN SOUTH KOREAN AMBASSADOR STATED ABOVE.   WHEN ASKED IF DECISION WOULD BE MADE SOON,  COOK SAID PM WAS DUE TO LEAVE ON OVERSEAS TRIP APRIL 17  AND THAT COOK EXPECTS DECISION WILL BE MADE BEFORE PM S DEPARTURE.   COOK SAID GOA HAD FOUR POSSIBLE CHOICES;  TO BE FOR,  TO BE AGAINST,  TO ABSTAIN,  OR TO "" LOOK ONESELF UP IN THE BATHROOM WHEN THE VOTE IS TAKEN"".   HE THEORIZED THAT TO DELAY CONSIDERATION OF NORTH KOREA S APPLICATION COULD ONLY RESULT IN FURTHER POST- PONEMENT OF MATTER.   HE THEN SAID THAT GOA WAS IN PROCESS  DETERMINING ITS POSITION ON KOREAN ITEM IN UNGA AND ON UNCURK WHICH HE HOPED WOULD BE ACCOMPLISHED BY END OF APRIL WHEN COOK IS DUE TO BE TRANSFERRED TO HEAD MISSION OVERSEAS.   WHEN EMBOFF EXPRESSED SOME SURPRISE THAT GOA POSITION WAS TO BE DETERMINED SOME MONTHS IN ADVANCE UNGA,  COOK SAID HIS OFFICE HAD BEEN WORKING ON QUESTIONS FOR MORE THAN A YEAR AND THAT HE WISHED TO WRAP SUBJECT UP BEFORE HIS DEPARTURE.\n3.   WITH REGARD TO WHA MATTER,  COOK SAID IN COURSE CONVERSATION THAT IN ADDITION TO APPROACH MADE IN WAHSINGTON,  HE UNDERSTOOD BOTH HMG AND JAPANESE WERE APPARENTLY WILLING TO APPROACH OTHER GOVERNMENTS IN SUPPORT OF HAVING MATTER POSTPONED AT WHA MEETING. COOK STATED ONCE GOA DECISION IS MADE,  USG WILL BE INFORMED OF POSITION.\n4.   COMMENT:   IN LIGHT OF GOA S MOVEMENT TO OPEN CONTACTS WITH NORTH KOREAN GOVERNMENT,  AND COOK S THEORETICAL COMMENT IN PARAGRAPH TWO ABOVE,  EMBOFF CAME AWAY FROM MEETING WITH  IMPRESSION THAT DFA WAS RECOMMENDING TO PRIME MINISTER THAT GOA SUPPORT APPLICATION OF NORTH KOREA AT WHA MEETING.   REASON FOR HESITANCY IN TELLING US PROBABLY STEMS FROM INTERNAL GOA NEED TO HAVE PM S IMPRIMATUR BEFORE TELLING OTHER FRIENDLY GOVERNMENTS, AND TO SOME DOUBT THAT PM WILL ACCEPT DFA RECOMMENDATION WITHOUT CHANGE.   AT NO TIME DURING CONVERSATION DID COOK INDICATE ANY READINESS TO TELL SOUTH KOREANS OF GOA DECISION ONCE IT IS MADE ALTHOUGH DIRECT QUESTION DID NOT ARISE.   IN PREVIOUS CON- VERSATIONS,  COOK HAS SHOWN CONSIDERABLE DISENCHANTMENT WITH SOUTH KOREAN GOVERNMENT AND AUSTRALIA S "" RUBBER- STAMP"" PARTICIPATION IN UNCURK. RICE\n",546222

IN VIEW OF THE CONVERSATIONS NOW UNDER WAY,  I CANNOT TELL YOU MORE AT THIS STAGE.  UNQTE.     SYG SPLKESMAN REFUSED TO RESPOND TO A NUMBER OF QUESTIONS BUT IN REPLY TO ONE WAS REPORTED TO HAVE SAID THAT IT COULD BE CONCLUDED THAT DISCUSSIONS ARE STILL UNDER WAY. \n2.  ON LEARNING OF LINE TAKEN BY UN SPOKESMAN,  AMB PHILLIPS TELEPHONED URQUHART TO CLAIRIFY.  URGUHART SAID THAT HE HAD BEEN TELEPHONED ABOUT 4  AM APRIL 10  BY AUBRAC AND WALDHEIM ( BOTH OF WHOM IN EUROPE).  SYG HAD PREPARED PRESS LINE VERY CAREFULLY BECAUSE HE MOST ANXIOUS TO AVOID GIVING PUBLIC REBUFF TO PRG.  SYG DOES NOT WANT TO ENCOURAGE PUBLIC CONFRONTATION AND,  IN FACT,  IS ( THROUGH AUBRAC)  ENDEAVORING TO "" EDUCATE""  PRG ON REALITIES. \n3.  URQUHART CONFIRMED TO PHILLIPS THAT MESSAGE HAD  ACTUALLY BEEN TRANSMITTED APRIL 9  TO PRG AND THAT LETTER MAKES IT ABUNDANTLY CLEAR THAT THERE IS NO POSSIBILITY OF PRG BEING GRANTED OBSERVER STATUS AT UN.  URGUHART CONFIRMED THAT POSSIBILITY OF INFORMAL CONTACTS FOR HUMITARIAN PURPOSES ARE SUBJECT OF AUBRAC- PRG DISCUSSION. \n4.

SYG WALDHEIM OPENED DISCUSSION OF SOUTHEAST ASIA WITH AMB SCALI APRIL 26  BY EXPRESSING SATISFACTION THAT HE HAS HAD COPIES OF BOTH HANOI AND PRG COMPLAINTS RE IMPLEMENTATION  PARIS AGREEMENTS AND US REPLY.  WALDHEIM SAID UN HAD NOT REACTED TO HANOI AND PRG COMMUNICATIONS.  HE HAD IN MIND TELLING THEM UN COULD ONLY TAKE NOTE OF THEIR COMMUNICATIONS BECAUSE PARIS ACCORDS GIVE NO POLITICAL ROLE TO UN. \n2.  SCALI SAID US TAKES VERY SERIOUSLY QUESTIONS ABOUT ENEMY S INTENTIONS.  SCALI SAID HE EXPECTED THAT FOLLOWING AMB SULLIVAN S TALKS IN PARIS,  MR.  KISSINGER WOULD SPEAK FOR PRESIDENT AND MAKE CLEAR THAT HANOI AND PRG BEHAVIOR THREATENS WHOLE FOUNDATION FOR PROPOSED SETTLEMENT IN AREA.  US WOULD ALSO SPEAK TO USSR AND PRC.  WE ARE OF COURSE CONCERNED ABOUT CAMBODIA AND LAOS DEVELOPMENTS AND WILL REMIND PARTIES THAT THERE ARE RELEVANT AGREEMENTS WHICH NOT BEING UPHELD.  NORTH VIETNAMESE MUST UNDERSTAND THEIR BEHAVIOR MAKES IT IMPOSSIBLE FOR US TO EVEN CONSIDER GOING TO CONGRESS FOR FUNDS,  EVEN FOR INTERNATIONAL ASSISTANCE.  THEY SIMPLY MUST REALIZE THAT US MEANT AND MEANS BUSINESS-  THAT US PRESIDENT WOULD NOT SIT PARALYZED AND UNWILLING TO     SECRET      DO ANYTHING IN FACE FLAGRANT BREACHES OF ACCORDS. \n3.  WALDHEIM SAID HE WAS DEEPLY WORRIED.  AS YET THERE WAS  NO CEASEFIRE.  HE PROFOUNDLY HOPES SULLIVAN AND KISSINGER TALKS WILL "" WORK"". \n4.

UNICEF IS EXCEPTION TO THIS GENERALIZATION,  AND BILATERAL AID FROM US MIGHT ALSO BE EXCEPTION.  PRG SEEMED MORE  INTERESTED THAY ANYONE ELSE,  OBVIOUSLY FOR POLITICAL REASONS. \n5.  REFERRING TO PRG LIAISON QUESTION,  WALDHIEM REITEREATED THAT THERE HAD BEEN NO CHANGE IN SITUATION.

SCALI RESPONDED THAT SYG ALREADY AWARE OF OUR SERIOUS CONCERN LEST UN DO SOMETHING TO ENHANCE PRG PRESTIGE,  THUS MAKING PEACE MORE DIFFICULT.  AFTER ASSURING WALDHEIM OF HIS CONFIDENCE IN SYG S DISCRETION,  SCALI TOLD HIM THAT DRVN AND PRG ARE CONTINUING TO SPREAD STORY THAT PRG LETTER ASKING OBSERVER STATUS HAD BEEN SOLICITED BY SYG.  WALDHIEM OBVIOUSLY DEEPLY DISTRESSED THANKED SCALI FOR THIS INFORMATION.  AND DECLARED VEHEMENTLY "" THIS IS ABSOLUTELY UNTRUE"".  THERE HAD BEEN ABSOLUTELY NO CONTACT WHATSOEVER IN THIS REGARD.  "" WHAT IS TRUE"",  SAID WALDHIEM,  "" IS THAT I RAISED THE QUESTION OF CONTACTS REGARDING AID.""  IN FURTHER REMARKS,  WALDHEIM MADE IT QUITE CLEAR THAT HE NOW INCLINED TO DISTRUST DRVN AND PRG STRONGLY.  HE ALSO INDICATED AWARENESS THAT AUBRAC IS PRO- HANOI AND SAID HE USES AUBRAC SOLELY AS MAILBOX.  SCALI\n",540638

MINISTER REPEATED THAT THE GOVERNMENT WOULDBE ACTIVELY                            REVIEWING THIS WHOLE QUESTION IN THE NEXTFEW DAYSCONFIDENTIALDAVIES,frus1969-76ve15p1d45,"1.  FOLLOWING READING OF ORAL STATEMENT,  TREPCZYNSKI SAID HE WISHED TO ADD THE FOLLOWING OBSERVATIONS IN THE NAME OF THE LEADERSHIP OF THE MINISTRY AND OF HIMSELF,  PERSONALLY. \n2.  HE SAID THE MINISTRY UNDERSTOOD VERY WELL THE CON-  CERN OF THE U. S.  GOVERNMENT AS A RESULT OF THE DEVELOP-  MENTS IN VIETNAM.  THEY WERE ALSO VERY CONCERNED BE-  CAUSE THEY HAD A DELEGATION IN THE ICCS,  WHICH WAS DOING WHAT IT COULD TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE RESTORATION OF PEACE.  IT WAS,  HOWEVER,  QUITE OBVIOUS THAT POLAND HAD NO INFLUENCE ON THE CONTINUING CONFLICT IN VIETNAM,  NOR HAD POLAND PARICIPATED IN FORMULATING THE PROVISIONS OF THE PEACE AGREEMENT.  POLAND HAD TAKEN PART IN THE PARIS CONFERENCE,  AS WE KNEW,  AND THE MINISTRY FOUND IT DIFFICULT TO UNDERSTAND OUR COMPLAINTS,  BECAUSE WHAT THE POLISH DELEGATION WAS DOING IN THE ICCS CONSTI-  TUTED THE DEFENSE OF THE INTEGRITY OF THE PARIS AGREEMENT  CONFIDENTIAL         -- A DEFENSE WHICH THE MINISTRY REGARDED AS BEING AS MUCH IN THE INTEREST OF ACHIEVING THE U. S.  GOAL AS OF THE POLISH GOAL OF CONTRIBUTING TO THE RESTORATION OF PEACE.  THE ICCS,  HE SAID,  WAS OPERATING UNDER VERY DIFFICULT CIRCUMSTANCES AND WE COULD NOT EXPECT IT TO ACHIEVE TOO MUCH. \n3.  THE MINISTRY REGARDED AS UNACCEPTABLE THE CONTEN-  TION THAT THE SITUATION IN THE ICCS SHOULD HAVE AN IMPACT ON U. S.-  POLISH BILATERAL RELATIONS.  IF THAT SHOULD BE THE CASE,  THEN THE MINISTRY WOULD HAVE TO CONSIDER WHETHER IT HAD BEEN RIGHT IN ACCEPTING THE INVITATION OF THE U. S.  AND THE DRV TO JOIN THE ICCS. \n4.  THE DEFERMENT OF THE KACZMAREK AND MITREGA VISITS WAS ASTONISHING AND THE MINISTRY WOULD REALLY PREFER NOT TO COMMENT ON IT.  IT COULD NOT BELIEVE THAT THIS DEFERMENT COULD IN FACT OCCUR,  SINCE THE VISITS CON-  FORMED TO THE DECISIONS REACHED DURING PRESIDENT NIXON S VISIT TO WARSAW. \n5.  CONSEQUENTLY,  THE MINISTRY HOPES THAT THIS DECI-  SION IS NOT THE FINAL ONE AND THAT IT MIGHT BE RECONSIDERED. \n6.  AS HE HAD TOLD ME THEY WOULD,  THEY HAD HAD INTEN-  SIVE CONSULTATIONS WITH AMBASSADOR WASILEWSKI DURING HIS STAY HERE ( HE IS STILL IN WARSAW AND SHOULD RETURN TO SAIGON IN THE NEXT FEW DAYS).  THEY HAVE DISCUSSED THE ENTIRE SITUATION WITH HIM AND AS A RESULT QUITE UNDERSTAND THE SITUATION AND THE DIFFICULTIES UNDER WHICH THE ICCS WAS OPERATING.  IT COULD NOT BE A POLICE FORCE AND COULD ONLY FULFILL ITS ROLE EFFECTIVELY WHEN IT HAD THE COOPERATION OF THE TWO SOUTH VIETNAMESE SIDES.  AS HE HAD TOLD ME LAST SATURDAY,  THE POLISH PRESS HAD SUBSTANTIALLY MODIFIED ITS TREATMENT OF DEVELOPMENTS IN VIETNAM AS A RESULT OF OUR DISCUSSIONS WITH THEM.  WE WOULD NOTE THAT THE PRESS HAD NOT PUBLISHED ANYTHING RECRIMINATORY OR POLEMICAL AS A RESULT OF THE SHOOTING DOWN OF THE ICCS HELICOPTER LAST WEEK,  ALTHOUGH THEY HAD BEEN TOLD BY THE PRG THAT THE REPUBLIC OF SOUTH VIETNAM FORCES SOMETIMES USED MARKINGS ON THEIR OWN  CONFIDENTIAL         HELICOPTERS WHICH RESEMBLED THOSE USED ON ICCS HELI-  COPTERS AND DESPITE THE FACT THAT IT APPEARED THE HELI-  COPTERS WERE SOME TWENTY- FIVE MILES OUT OF THE CORRIDOR IN WHICH THEY WERE SUPPOSED TO FLY.  AS THEY HAD SAID IN THEIR ORAL STATEMENT,  THEY DID NOT WISH TO POLEMICIZE IN THE PRESS ON THESE MATTERS. \n7.  I SAID THAT I WOULD IMMEDIATELY TRANSMIT TO MY GOVERNMENT THE TWO STATEMENTS HE HAD MADE.  I COULD,  HOWEVER,  GIVE HIM SOME PERSONAL REACTIONS NOW. \n8.  FIRST,  I SAID THAT IT SEEMED TO ME BETTER NOT TO DWELL ON THE SHOOTING- DOWN OF THE ICCS HELICOPTER.  THIS WAS THE FIRST TIME I HAD HEARD THE ALLEGATION THAT GRV HELICOPTERS SOMETIMES BORE MARKINGS RESEMBLING THOSE USED BY THE ICCS.  TREPCZYNSKI INTERRUPTED TO SAY THAT THIS WAS SOMETHING THEY HAD HEARD,  BUT OF WHICH THEY HAD NO PROOF.  I SAID THE FACT REMAINED THAT THE HELICOPTERS HAD ABOARD THEM PRG PERSONNEL WHO WERE SUPPOSED TO SERVE AS NAVIGATORS.  I DID NOT SEE HOW THIS INCIDENT COULD BY ANY STRETCH OF THE IMAGINATION BE LAID AT THE DOOR OF ANYBODY BUT THE PRG.   \n9.  SECOND,  NOBODY HAD IMAGINED THAT THE TASK OF THE ICCS WOULD BE EITHER EASY OR WITHOUT RISK.  NEITHER DID WE THINK THAT THE ICCS COULD OR SHOULD BE A POLICE FORCE,  NOR,  IN OUR DISCUSSIONS WITH THE POLISH GOVERN-  MENT,  HAD WE BASED ANYTHING WE SAID ON SUCH A CONCEPT OF ITS ROLE.  WE HAD BEEN ASKING,  ON THE OTHER HAND,  THAT COMPLAINTS OF VIOLATIONS WHICH CAME BEFORE THE ICCS BE DEALT WITH BY ALL DELEGATIONS ON AS OBJECTIVE AND IMPARTIAL A BASIS AS POSSIBLE.  IT WAS IN THIS AREA,  AND NOT IN ANY OTHER,  THAT WE HAD RAISED THIS ISSUE,  PURSUANT TO THE SUGGESTION FOREIGN MINISTER OLSZOWSKI HAD MADE TO ME ON FEBRUARY 2  THAT WE BRING TO EACH OTHER S ATTENTION ANY PROBLEMS WE SAW TOWARDS THE SOLUTION OF WHICH WE THOUGHT THE OTHER PARTY COULD MAKE A CONTRIBUTION.  WE CONTINUED TO BE DISSATISFIED WITH THE ATTITUDE DISPLAYED BY MEMBERS OF THE POLISH DELEGATION TOWARDS COMPLAINTS OF PRG VIOLATIONS.  WHEN SUCH COMPLAINTS WERE MADE,  OTHER DELEGATIONS WERE PRE-  PARED TO INVESTIGATE THEM,  BUT THE POLISH AND HUNGARIAN  CONFIDENTIAL         DELEGATIONS ALL TOO FREQUENTLY WERE NOT.  I COULD SUPPLY A CONSIDERABLE ADDITIONAL LIST OF SUCH CASES,  WHICH OUR EMBASSY IN SAIGON HAD REPORTED SINCE ASSISTANT SECRETARY GREEN HAD FIRST SPOKEN WITH AMBASSADOR TRAMPCZYNSKI AND,  INDEED,  SINCE DEPUTY SECRETARY RUSH HAD SPOKEN WITH MR.  FRACKIEWICZ.  IT WOULD PERHAPS BE ENOUGH SIMPLY TO CITE THE CASE IN WHICH POLISH AND HUNGARIAN DELEGATES HAD REFUSED TO JOIN MEMBERS OF THE CANADIAN AND INDO-  NESIAN TEAMS AT QUANG TRI BEACUASE THEY WERE AFRAID THAT SNAKES WERE IN THE AREA.  I UNDERSTOOD THAT,  DURING OUR ENTIRE INVOLVEMENT IN VIETNAM,  ONLY ONE U. S.  SOLDIER HAD DIED OF SNAKEBITE.  THIS MIGHT SEEM A TRIVIAL EXAMPLE,  BUT,  TAKEN WITH ALL THE OTHERS,  IT LEFT US WITH THE IM-  PRESSION THAT THE POLISH DELEGATION WAS SEEKING PRETEXTS TO AVOID DOING AS MUCH AS IT COULD. \n0.  THE CONTENTION THAT INVESTIGATIONS COULD ONLY BE UNDERTAKEN WHEN THERE WAS COOPERATION BETWEEN THE ICCS AND BOTH SOUTH VIETNAMESE SIDES SEEMED TO US CALCULATED TO UNDERMINE THE POSSIBILITY OF MAKING ANY INVESTIGATION AT ALL.  THAT WAS WHY WE HAD POINTED PARTICULARLY TO ARTICLE 2  OF THE PROTOCOL ON THE ICCS,   WHICH MADE IT CLEAR THAT THE COMMISSION SHOULD IN-  VESTIGATE WHENEVER IT HAD ADEQUATE GROUNDS FOR BELIEVING THERE HAD BEEN A VIOLATION. \n1.  FINALLY,  I SAID,  THE IMPORTANT POINT WAS THAT THERE SHOULD BE EVIDENCE IN THE ACTIONS OF THE POLISH DELEGA-  TION ON THE GROUND IN SOUTH VIETNAM THAT IT WAS PRE-  PARED TO MAKE INVESTIGATIONS WHEN COMPLAINTS WERE MADE BY EITHER SIDE,  BY THE GRV AS WELL AS THE PRG. \n2.  I ADDED THAT I CERTAINLY DID NOT WISH TO SEE AN INTERRUPTION OF THE FAVORABLE DEVELOPMENT OF US- POLISH RELATIONS,  WHICH HAD OCCURRED AS A RESULT OF THE PRESIDENT S VISIT.  IT WAS PRECISELY FOR THIS REASON THAT WE HAD BEEN BRING-  ING THE SITUATION IN THE ICCS TO THE ATTENTION OF THE POLISH GOVERNMENT.  IT WAS WITH THIS IN M\n",540450

POLISH MINISTER FRACKIEWICZ INVITED DEPUTY ASSISTANT SECRETARY SULLIVAN TO LUNCH APRIL 19  TO DISCUSS CURRENT INDOCHINA SITUATION.   ALTHOUGH HE BEGAN DISCUSSION WITH LENGTHY APOLOGIA FOR HANOI LEADERSHIP ( WHICH HE DESCRIBED AS "" CAVE- MAN COMMUNISTS"")  HE DID NOT RPT NOT MAKE ANY EFFORT TO DISPUTE SULLIVAN S REBUTTALS.\n2.   INSTEAD,  HE FOCUSSED ON POLISH DILEMMA ON ICCS AND ASKED WHAT WE REALLY EXPECTED POLES AND HUNGARIANS COULD ACCOMPLISH.   SULLIVAN SAID THAT WE HAD NO RPT NO ILLUSIONS THAT ICCS COULD FUNCTION AS A POLICE FORCE IN VIET- NAM.  CONFIDENTIAL\n3.   WE KNEW THAT MANY POLISH AND HUNGARIAN REPRESENTATIVES ON ICCS FELT ASHAMED OF THEIR OWN CRAVEN BEHAVIOR AND WE ASSUMED SENIOR POLISH OFFICIALS IN WARSAW FELT THE SAME WAY.   WHAT WE EXPECTED OF THE POLES AND HUNGARIANS WAS TO INSTRUCT THEIR DELEGATIONS TO TAKE OBJECTIVE AND HONORABLE STANDS ON THE FACTS AS THEY KNEW THEM TO BE,  THUS MAKING THE ICCS AN HONEST PEACEKEEPING INSTRUMENT.   WE FELT THAT SUCH ACTION WOULD DEMONSTRATE TO HANOI THAT THE ICCS COULD BE COUNTED ON NOT RPT NOT TO PROSTITUTE ITSELF TO DRV VIOLATIONS AND WOULD INDUCE HANOI TO RESPECT PROVISIONS OF AGREEMENT.\n4.   FRACKIEWICZ ACCEPTED THIS RATHER BLUNT FORMULATION WITH GOOD GRACE AND REFRAINED FROM ANY ACCUSATIONS AGAINST U. S.,  GVN,  OR CANADA.   HE MERELY STATED THAT WASILEWSKI HAD BEEN ON SERIOUS CONSULTATIONS IN WARSAW,  WOULD RETURN TO SAIGON IN TIME TO BE CHAIRMAN FOR THE MONTH OF MAY, AND HAD BEEN INSTRUCTED TO TAKE CONSTRUCTIVE AND OBJECTIVE ATTITUDE TOWARDS HIS TASK.\n5.   COMMENT:   FRACKIEWICZ WAS SURPRISINGLY MILD IN HIS APPROACH,  PARTICULARLY IN HIS DEFENSE OF HANOI.   HE COUCHED HIS STATEMENTS IN THE FORM OF AN APPEAL FOR UNDER- STANDING OF POLISH DIFFICULTIES RATHER THAN IN FORM OF AN EXCUSE FOR PAST ACTIONS.   HE APPEARED TO WISH TO LEAVE THE IMPRESSION THAT POLISH CONDUCT WOULD IMPROVE IN THE FUTURE.    PORTER\n",544365

MINISTER REPEATED THAT THE GOVERNMENT WOULDBE ACTIVELY                            REVIEWING THIS WHOLE QUESTION IN THE NEXTFEW DAYSCONFIDENTIALDAVIES,frus1969-76ve15p1d45,"1.  IN MARCH,  I PLACED A REQUEST FOR A COURTESY CALL WITH THE OFFICE OF RYSZARD FRELEK,  MEMBER OF THE SECRETARIAT OF THE UNITED POLISH WORKER S  PARTY ( PZPR),  WHOM I HAD MET DURING HIS 1969  VISIT TO WASHINGTON ( HE THEN WAS DIRECTOR OF THE POLISH INSTITUTE OF INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS).  INITIALLY,  WE WERE TOLD THAT FRELEK WAS SICK ( APRIL 19  HE CONFIRMED THAT HE HAD SPENT TWO WEEKS AT A SANATORIUM IN KRYNICA;  HIS COMPLAINT IS COLITIS MUCOSA).  FOLLOWING HIS RETURN TO ACTIVE DUTY,  A REITERATED REQUEST FOR AN APPOINTMENT MET WITH NO POSITIVE RESPONSE UNTIL APRIL 13,  WHEN FRELEK S OFFICE TOOK THE INITIATIVE AND GAVE ME AN APPOINTMENT FOR THE AFTERNOON OF APRIL 17.  EARLY THIS WEEK,  WE WERE INFORMED THAT FRELEK WISHED ME TO COME TO LUNCH APRIL 19  AT THE FORIGN MINISTRY PALACE ON FOKSAL STREET,  INSTEAD OF MEETING HIM IN HIS OFFICE. \n2.  WE HAD A TWO- HOUR LUNCH IN A RELAXED AND CORDIAL ATMOSPHERE,  WHICH CONCLUDED WITH FRELEK OFFERING TO SEE ME WHENEVER I WISHED AND TO PROVIDE ANY ASSISTANCE HE COULD ON MATTERS OF MUTUAL CONCERN.  ( HE ALSO AGREED TO MY SUGGESTION THAT IT WOULD BE GOOD TO ESATBLISH CONTACT BETWEEN THE EMBASSY AND THE OFFICER OF HIS SECTION OF THE SECRETARIAT,  ZDZISLAW NICINSKI,  WHO IS CHARGED WITH FO  L-  LOWING RELATIONS WITH THE US).   CONFIDENTIAL        CONFIDENTIAL   3.  THE FIRST HALF- HOUR OF CONVERSATION WAS OCCUPIED BY FRELEK S OUTLINING OF POLISH ECONOMIC GOALS ( EXPEDITED CONTRUCTION OF HOUSING;  INCREASED BEEF PRODUCTION FOR EXPORT;  INCREASED SUPPLY OF AUTOMOBILES FOR INDIVIDUAL USE;  INCREASED EXPORTS;  ESTABLISHMENT OF ECONOMIC COOPERATION WITH WESTERN FIRMS AND,  PARTICULARLY,  AMERICAN COMPANIES). \n4.  FOLLOWING THIS,  FRELEK TURNED TO CURRENT US- POLISH RELATIONS BY ASKING WHY THE STORY ON POSTPONEMENT OF THE MITREGA- KACZMAREK VISIT HAD BEEN PUBLISHED AND THEN CONFIRMED BY THE DEPARTMENT SPOKESMAN.  I REPLIED THAT I HAD HEARD OF THE STORY ONLY FROM VOA AND IN A BRIEF WIRELESS FILE ITEM AND CONSEQUENTLY HAD NO EXACT IDEA OF HOW IT HAD SURFACED,  EXACTLY WHAT IT SAID,  OR WHAT THE SPOKESMAN HAD SAID IN REPLYING TO QUESTIONS ABOUT IT.  I THEREFORE COULD NOT AGREE WITH THE IMPLICATION OF HIS QUESTION THAT WE HAD PURPOSEFULLY LEAKED THE STORY.  FRELEK SAID THAT,  AS I KNEW,  WASILEWSKI HAD JUST LEFT WARSAW TO RETURN TO VIETMAN.  HE HAD BEEN GIVEN INSTRUCTIONS QUOTE TO BE AS FLEXIBLE AND OBJECTIVE AS POSSIBLE UNQUOTE IN PURSUING THE RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE POLISH DELEGATION TO THE ICCS.   NOW,  THIS STORY HAD APPEARED AND IT PUT THE POLES QUOTE BETWEEN TWO FIRES UNQUOTE,  SINCE QUOTE OUR FRIENDS IN HANOI UNQTE WILL READ IT,  TOO.  I ASKED WHETHER HE MEANT THAT THE INSTRUCTION WASILEWSKI HAD BEEN GIVEN WOULD BE CHANGED AS A RESULT OF THE WASHINGTON POST STORY.  FRELEK SAID THAT THOSE INSTRUCTIONS WOULD STAND,  BUT THAT WASILEWSKI S TASK WOULD CERTAINLY NOT BE MADE ANY EASIER AS A RESULT OF THE STORY. \n5.  FRELEK THEN LAUNCHED INTO AN EXPOSITION OF THE POLISH VIEW OF THE SITUATION IN SOUTH VIETNAM AND ITHIE ICCS S INABILITY TO ACT AS A POLICE FORCE,  CONTAINING THE PRINCIPAL ELEMENT OF THE PRESENTATION TREPCZYNSKI HAD MADE ON APRIL 14.  HIS CENTRAL POINT WAS ENBODIED IN THE CONTENTION THAT THE US AND DRV HAD MADE AN AGREEMENT WHICH BOTH SIDES AND CARRIED OUT MORE OR LESS COMPLETELY AND SUCCESSFULLY,  BUT THAT THERE HAD BEEN NO EFFECTIVE AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE GRV AND PRG,  WHICH CONTINUED TO FIGHT AND WHICH HAD MADE NO PROGRESS AT ALL TOWARDS A POLITICAL SETTLEMENT.  UNDER THESE CIRCUMSTANCES,  HE SAID,  THAT ICCS WAS LEFT TO TRY TO  CONFIDENTIAL        CONFIDENTIAL    ENFORCE A CEASEFIRE WHICH HAD REALLY NEVER TAKEN PLACE. \n6.  HE CONCLUDED THIS PRESENTATION BY REMARKING THAT POLAND HAD AGREED TO SERVE ON THE ICCS IN THE BELIEF THAT,  BY DOING SO,  IT WAS SERVING ITS OWN INTERESTS,  BOTH BY ENGAGING IN AN ACTIVITY WHICH MIGHT HELP BRING TO A CLOSE THE FLIGHTING WHICH HAD OVERSHADOWED THE DEVELOPMENT OF BETTER EAST- WEST RELATIONS AND BY AGREEING TO HELP THE UNITED STATES,  THE INTERESTS OF WORLD PEACE,  AND THE INTERESTS OF ITS FELLOW SOCIALIST STATE,  THE DRV.  IRONICALLY,  HE SAID,  IT NOW APPEARED THAT AN UNFORESEEN RESULT OF ITS AGREEMENT MIGHT BE A WORSENING OF ITS RELATIONS WITH THE US. \n7.  I REPEATED THE PRINCIPAL LINES OF THE PRESENTATION DEPUTY SECRETARY RUSH HAD MADE TO FRACKIEWICZ,  STRESSING OUR CONCERN AT THE POLISH ICCS DELEGATION S INACTIVITY,  OBFUSCATION,  AND DELAYING TACTICS IN CONSIDERING COMPLAINTS FROM THE GRV. \n8.  FRELEK THEN GAVE ME THE ARGUMENT I HAD HEARD APRIL 18  FROM SOVIET AMBASSADOR PILOTOVICH:  THAT THE PRG MADE VERY FEW,  INDEED ALMOST NO,  COMPLAINTS OF VIOLATIONS.  I ASKED HIM WHY THIS WAS.  HE SAID THE PRG DID NOT BELIEVE THE ICCS COULD HELP IT AND,  AS A MATTER OF PRINCIPLE,  REFRAINED FROM SUBMITTING COMPLAINTS.  FOR THE SAME REASON,  IT REFRAINED FROM STAFFING THE TPJMC. \n9.  I SAID THAT THERE WAS NOT MUCH POINT IN OUR DELVING INTO THE INTRICACIES OF THE SITUATION IN VIETNAM AT THIS DISTANCE FROM THE ACTION.  I SAID WE HAD BEEN CLEAR FROM THE BEGINNING OF OUR DISCUSSIONS WITH THE POLES IN MARCH THAT WE WERE TALKING ONLY ABOUT ONE THING:  THE READINESS OF MEMBERS OF THE POLISH DELEGATION TO DO WHAT FOREIGN MINISTER OLSZOWSKI HAD TOLD ME THEY WOULD DO,  I. E.,  INVESTIGATE CHARGES OF VIOLATIONS OF THE PEACE AGREEMENTS.  THE TEST OF THIS WOULD THEREFORE BE VISIBLE IN THE ACTIONS OF THE POLISH ICCS DELEGATION.  WE HAD DETAILED A NUMBER OF INSTANCES IN WHICH WE FLED THE POLISH DELEGATION HAD NOT TAKEN ACTION OR HAD ACTED INADEQUATELY,  AND I HAD NOT YET YEARD FROM THE POLISH SIDE ANY EXPLANATION WHICH LED ME TO DOUBT THAT THE ACTIONS OF THE POLISH DELEGATIONS HAD NOT BEEN AS WE DESCRIBED THEM. \n0.  GOOD- NATUREDLY,  FRELEK SAID THAT IF THE POLISH SIDE WERE TO UNDERTAKE SUCH A REFUTATION,  TI WOULD BE TACITLY ACKNOWLEDGING THAT IT HAD AN OBLIGATION TO REPORT TO US ON THE WAY IN WHICH IT CONDUCTED ITS AFFAIRS IN AN INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATION.  THE  PRINCIPLE WAS INADMISSIBLE. \n1.  FRELEK THEN SAID THAT THE QUESTION IN WHICH HE WAS MORE INTERESTED WAS THAT OF THE FUTURE DEVELOPMENT OF OUR RELATIONS.  WITH REGARD TO THAT,  HE COULD TELL ME HE HAD RECOMMEND TO HIS SUPERIORS THAT THEY REACT CALMLY TO THE POSTPONEMENT OF THE MITREGA- KACZMAREK VISIT AND CONTINEU TO FULFILL THE OBLIGATIONS POLAND HAD UNDERTAKEN TOWARDS THE US WHEN THE PRESIDENT VISITED WARSAW.  HE COULD NOT,  OF COURSE,  SAY WHETHER HIS RECOMMENDATIONS WOULD BE ACCEPTED.  THE POLISH GOVERNMENT HAD HAD HOPES THAT THESE VISITS COULD CONTINEU THE PRECESS OF IMPROVING US- POLISH RELATIONS AND HAD HOPED,  MORE SPECIFICALLY,  THAT SOME BUSINESS COULD BE DONE,  PARTICULARLY DURING THE MITREGA VISIT.  PERHAPS IT WOULD BE POSSIBLE TO MEET THAT LATTER OBJECTIVE,  FOR EXAMPLE,  BY A VISIT A LOWER LEVEL THAN THAT OF A MINISTER.  I SAID I COULD INQUIRE ABOUT THIS POSSIBILITY.  FRELEK SAID HE HAD RECOMMENDED,  TOO,   THAT PRIME MINISTER JAROSZEWICZ RECEIVE THE SENATE COMMERCE COMMITTEE ( CODEL HARTKE).  I SAID I THOUGH SUCH A MEETING WOULD BE IN THE INTEREST OF BOTH SIDES.  IN GENERAL,  FRELEK CONCLUDED,  HE FELT THAT THE POLISH SIDE SHOULD CONTINUE TO FULFILL ACCURATELY THE UNDERTAKINGS IT HAD ASSUMED DURING AND AS A RESULT OF THE PRESIDENT S VISIT. \n2.  I SAID I WOULD OF COURSE REPORT WHAT HE HAD SAID,  BUT REPEATED THAT I THOUGHT THE TEST WOULD STILL BE THE ATTITUTE AND ACTIVITIES OF THE POLISH ICCS DELEGATION.  DAVIES\n",540459

TRAMPCZYNSKI THEN ASKED FOR STOESSEL S APPRECIATION OF THE FUTURE OF US- POLISH RELA- TIONS.\n4.   STOESSEL RESPONDED WITH THANKS FOR THE POLISH STATE- MENTS ON AMERICAN VISITORS.   TURNING TO US INTENTIONS,  HE SAID WE WERE PLEASED BY DEVELOPMENTS THE PAST YEAR AND WANT TO SEE FURTHER IMPROVEMENT IN ALL RESPECTS,  POLITICAL, ECONOMIC,  CULTURAL,  AND SCIENTIFIC.   HE SAID WE SHALL CONTINUE TO ADHERE TO THE AGREEMENTS WORKED OUT DURING THE PRESIDENT S VISIT LAST SPRING,  AND WE DESIRE TO BUILD ON THAT FOUNDATION.\n5.   STOESSEL SAID OUR INTENTIONS,  HOWEVER,  WERE CONTINGENT UPON DEVELOPMENTS IN VIETNAM.   WE ARE DEEPLY CONCERNED ABOUT THE SITUATION THERE WHICH IS OF THE HIGHEST IMPORT- ANCE TO OUR COUNTRY,  TO THE PRESIDENT,  AND TO THE SECRETARY OF STATE.   WE ATTACH GREAT IMPORTANCE TO THE PARIS ACCORDS AND THE ICCS WHICH IS A KEY ELEMENT IN THIS AGREEMENT.   IN PARIS THE SECRETARY HELD CONVERSATIONS WITH THE POLISH FOREIGN MINISTER AND THE MINISTERS OF THE OTHER POWERS CONCERNED.   WE BELIEVE IT WAS UNDERSTOOD BY ALL THAT THE ICCS WAS VITALLY IMPORTANT AND THAT IT WOULD FUNCTION IMPARTIALLY.   WE ACCEPTED AND KNEW THAT IT WAS NOT A POLICE FORCE;  BUT WE HAVE FOUND POLISH AND HUNGARIAN DELE- GATES ARE NOT FUNCTIONING IMPARTIALLY.

ACTING FOREIGN MINISTER TREPCZYNSKI ( ASSISTED BY INTERPRETER ZAKRZEWSKI,  WHO TOOK NOTES)  RECEIVED ME AT\n2.  BEGIN TEXT:     REFERRING TO THE POSITION OF THE GOVERNMENT OF THE UNITED STATES WITH REGARD TO THE ACTIVITY OF THE INTERNATIO-  NAL COMMISSION OF CONTROL AND SUPERVISION IN VIET NAM DECLARED TO THE POLISH EMBASSY IN WASHINGTON ON 30  MARCH,   CONFIDENTIAL         1973,  AND TO THE MINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS OF POLAND IN WARSAW ON 7  APRIL,  1973,  THE GOVERNMENT OF THE POLISH PEOPLE S REPUBLIC WISHES TO STATE THE FOLLOWING: \n1.  POLAND UNDERTOOK TO PARTICIPATE IN THE ICCS NOT ON ITS OWN INITIATIVE BUT AT THE REQUEST OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA AND OF THE DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF VIET NAM BELIEVING THAT IT COULD THEREBY CONTRIBUTE TO THE STRENGTH-  ENING OF PEACE IN SOUTH VIET NAM.  WHILE MAKING THAT DECISION POLAND WAS PROMPTED NOT BY ANY NARROW CONSIDERATIONS BUT BY A DESIRE OF A PEACEFUL SETTLEMENT. \n2.  THE GOVERNMENT OF THE POLISH PEOPLE S REPUBLIC HAS ALWAYS HELD THE POSITION THAT THE ICCS CAN FUNCTION ONLY GIVEN THE GOOD WILL OF THE TWO SIDES TO IMPLEMENT THE PARIS AGREEMENT.  THIS CONTINUES TO BE OUR POSITION.  THE ICCS HAS NOT BEEN ESTABLISHED AS A POLICE FORCE;  NEITHER MAY IT SUBSTITUTE OR BY- PASS THE SOUTH VIETNAMESE PARTIES WHICH ARE UNDER THE OBLIGATION TO COOPERATE WITH THE ICCS.  IT IS THE FIRM BELIEF OF THE GOVERNMENT OF THE POLISH PEOPLE S REPUBLIC THAT ONLY THE ACTIVITY CONDUCTED STRICTLY WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF THE PARIS AGREEMENT AND THE OBSERVANCE OF ALL ITS PROVISIONS CAN GUARANTEE A GENUINELY IMPARTIAL AND OBJECTIVE POSITION OF THE ICCS AND CONTRIBUTE TO THE SUCCESS OF THE MISSION WITH WHICH THE ICCS HAS BEEN ENTRUSTED.  THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE ICCS DEPENDS DIRECTLY ON THE DEGREE OF COOPERATION BETWEEN THE SOUTH VIETNAMESE PARTIES AND ON THE ACTIVITY OF THE JOINT MILITARY COMMISSION.  THE EFFICIENCY OF THE ICCS WILL- IN THE OPINION OF THE POLISH GOVERNMENT- INCREASE FOLLOWING THE PROCESS OF BRINGING ABOUT BY THE SOUTH VIETNAMESE PARTIES OF THE RELATIONS DEFINED IN THE PARIS AGREEMENT.  UNFORTUNATELY,  THE PRESENT INTERNAL SITUATION OF SOUTH VIET NAM IS NOT FAVOURABLE FOR SUCH RELATIONS TO BE INSTITUTED. \n3.  ARMED STRUGGLE IN SOUTH VIET NAM CONTINUES CHIEFLY OWING TO THE DANGEROUS POLICY OF THE AUTHORITIES OF THE REPUBLIC OF VIET NAM WHO UTILIZE THE TREMENDOUS MILITARY POTENTIAL ACCUMULATED DURING MANY YEARS AND EMPLOY AN ARMY SEVERAL HUNDRED STHOUSAND MEN STRONG IN THEIR ATTEMPTS TO TILT,  BY BRUTE FORCE,  THE EXISTING POLTICAL AND TERRITORIAL  CONFIDENTIAL         STATUS IN THEIR FAVOUR.  THIS IS OFTEN REPORTED BY THE AMERICAN PRESS.  IT IS PRECISELY SUCH POLICY OF THE AUTHORITIES OF THE REPUBLIC OF VIET- NAM THAT CONSITUTES THE IMMEDIATE CAUSE OF TENSION AND THE SOURCE OF THE ARMED INCIDENTS VIOLATING THE PARIS AGREEMENT.  IN THE TERRITORY CONTROLLED BY THE AUTHORITIES OF THE REPUBLIC OF VIET NAM A RUTHLESS POLICE- AND- MILITARY TERROR PREVAILS,  DRASTIC FORMS OF THE STATE OF EMERGENCY ARE USED,  AND ANY OPPOSITIONAL VOICES ASKING FOR THE RESTORATION OF DEMOCRATIC FREEDOMS ARE BEING BRUTALLY SUPPRESSED.  FOLLOWING 27  JANUARY,  1973,  TENS OF THOUSANDS OF PERSONS IN SOUTH VIET NAM LOST THEIR LIVES OR WERE WOUNDED.  MANY THOUSANDS ARE LANGUISHING IN PRISONS OF THE REPUBLIC OF VIET NAM MOST INHUMAN CONDITIONS.  THE AUTHORITIES OF THE REPUBLIC OF VIET NAM APPLY RUTHLESS TERROR.  IT IS OBVIOUS THAT SUCH POLICY OF THE AUTHORITIES OF THE REPUBLIC OF VIET NAM,  OVER WHICH THE ICCS HAS NO INFLUENCE WHATSOEVER,  DOES NOT PROMOTE RECONCILIATION OR NATIONAL CONCORD;  ON THE CONTRARY,  IT AGGRAVATES THE EXISTING TENSION. \n4.  UNDER SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES THE ACTIVITY OF THE ICCS,  WHICH IS EVEN DEPRIVED OF SUFFICIENT SECURITY,  IS VERY DIFFICULT.  THE POLISH GOVERNMENT EXPRESSES ITS SURPRISE AND CONCERN OVER THE CHARGES CONTAINED IN THE AMERICAN STATEMENT AND ADDRESSED TO THE POLISH DELEGATION IN THE ICCS REGARDING ITS ALLEGED LACK OF IMPARTIALITY AND ITS ALLEGED HAMPERING OF THE WORK OF THE ICCS.  SUCH CHARGES CANNOT BE SUBSTANTIATED.  THE STATEMENT OF THE AMERICAN GOVERNMENT EVEN SAYS THAT "" THE ICCS AFTER TWO MONTHS IS STILL FAILING COMPLETELY TO DISCHARGE THE RESPONSIBILITIES ENTRUSTED TO IT IN THE PEACE AGREEMENT"",  WHILE IN FACT IT DOES HAVE TO ITS CREDIT SPECIFIC AND OBJECTIVE ACTIVITY EXPRESSED ,  INTER ALIA,  BY ABOUT 50  INVESTIGATIONS UNDERTAKEN ON THE BASIS OF THOSE COMPLAINTS,  FILED BY THE PARTIES,  WHICH MET THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE PARIS AGREEMENT. \n5.  THE POLISH DELEGATION TO THE ICCS,  IMPLEMENTING THE MANDATE OF THE COMMISSION,  HAS ACTED WITH REASON AND RESTRAINT,  MINDFUL OF THE ACUTE ANTAGONISM OF THE TWO SIDES CONDITIONED BY HISTORICAL AND SOCIAL CONFLICTS.  THE POLISH DELEGATION DID NOT SUPPLY THE PRESS WITH THE INFORMATION ON THE PROCEEDINGS OF THE ICCS IN THE BELIEF  CONFIDENTIAL         THAT IT IS INADMISSIBLE TO INVOLVE THE INTERNATIONAL ORGAN INTO PROPAGANDA EXERCISES WHICH CAN BUT INFLUENCE ADVERSELY THE DISCHARGE OF THE TASKS ENTRUSTED TO THE ICCS.  THE POLISH DELEGATION FELT THAT IN THE ORGAN ONE SHOULD AVOID CREATING AN ATMOSPHERE OF NERVOUSNESS AND QUARREL SINCE THIS COULD ONLY HAMPER ITS WORK AND UNDERMINE ITS AUTHORITY.  THE POLISH GOVERNMENT IS KEEPING ABREAST OF THE ACTIVITIES OF THE POLISH DELEGATION AND,  RECENTLY,  DURING THE VISIT OF AMBASSADOR B.  WASILEWSKI TO WARSAW,  HAS MADE A COMPREHENSIVE ANALYSIS OF THE DELEGATION S WORK. \n6.  IT IS OUR PROFOUND CONVICTION THAT THROUGH OUR PARTICIPATION IN THE WORK OF THE ICCS WE ARE DISCHARGING A DIFFICULT TASK VIS- A- VIS INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY AND WE ARE CONTRIBUTING TO THE CONSOLIDATION OF PEACE IN VIET NAM.  IT IS THE HOPE OF THE POLISH GOVERNMENT THAT FURTHER DEVELOPMENT OF THE SITUATION IN SOUTH VIET NAM WILL ENABLE THE ICCS TO DISCHARGE ITS MANDATE,  AND THE POLISH DELEGATION\n7.  IT IS THE FIRM POSITION OF THE POLISH GOVERNMENT THAT THE THESIS EXPRESSED IN THE UNITED STATES STATEMENT ON A NEGATIVE IMPACT OF THE ACTIVITY IN THE ICCS ON THE STATE OF BILATERAL RELATIONS IS NOT ACCEPTABLE.  IN THE OPINION OF THE GOVERNMENT OF THE POLISH PEOPLE S REPUBLIC A CLEAR LINE SHOULD BE DRAWN TO SET APART THE SPHERE OF BILATERAL RELATIONS BETWEEN STATES FROM THE SPEHER OF THEIR ACTIVITY IN INTERNATIONAL ORGANS.  FOR THIS REASON THERE IS NOT,  AND THERE CANNOT BE,  ANY IUNCTIM BETWEEN THE ACTIVITY OF THE POLISH DELEGATION IN THE ICCS ( PARTICI-  PATING IN IT AT THE REQUEST,  INTER ALIA,  OF THE UNITED STATES)  AND THE COMAIN OF BILATERAL RELATIONS BETWEEN POLAND AND THE UNITED STATES.   CONFIDENTIAL         THE GOVERNMENT OF THE POLISH PEOPLE S REPUBLIC WISHES TO STATE WITH SATISFACTION THAT THE RELATIONS BETWEEN POLAND AND THE UNITED STATES ARE DEVELOPING FACOURABLY AND THAT THIS DEVELOPMENT HAS BEEN PARTICULARLY ACTIVE IN THE PERIOD FOLLOWING THE IMPORTANT VISIT OF PRESIDENT RICHARD NIXON TO POLAND.  THE POLISH GOVERNMENT IS DETERMINED TO CONTINUE WORKING CONSISTENTLY FOR A FURTHER EXPANSION OF OUR BILATERAL RELATIONS.  END TEXT.  DAVIES\n",540449
