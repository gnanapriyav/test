                 USIranian relations as never having been better We feel confident in                        saying Shah will be arriving in US at time when relations are even better                        and more solidly based than ever before Further President will be                        receiving a friendly and seasoned Chief of State who is at height of his                        power fully confident about wisdom of his policies and direction he is                        taking his country and justifiably proud of Irans and his remarkable                        achievements Shah values his friendship and meeting with President and                        looks forward to comparing notes and further developing close relationship                        and cooperation between US and Iran which are important to Shah and which                        help him guide his country into assuming greater role and responsibilities                        in this troubled part of the worldin best tradition of Nixon Doctrine2 During year since Presidents visit here Shah and Iran have moved from                        strength to strength domestically country remains politically stable and                        economy continues to develop vigorously Massive new Fifth Plan has just                        been launched over three times size of Fourth Plan calling for 36 billion                        investment in countrys future However dynamism of Iranian economy and of                        Shahs outlook are such that Shah has started talking about overhauling Plan                        as already too modest for his goals Attracted by Irans political stability                        and economic prospects American British French German Japanese and                        other businessmen are beating paths to Tehran to negotiate vast variety of                        economic and business arrangements which will further move this country forward and provide more balanced                        economy against day when Irans oil reserves will be depleted Lengthy and                        complex negotiations with oil consortium have been successfully completed                        and new oil arrangements have been established which Shah believes to be                        mutually advantageous to Iran and consortium and which should ensure secure                        supplies to consumers and substantial income to Iran Typically Shah is                        looking forward to new areas of development such as Irans extensive gas                        reserves3 On international front Shah is moving ahead energetically to gain further                        recognition and respect for Iran as stable and responsible member of                        international community In last year he has received world figures and has                        visited several important capitals He is embarked on what he calls                        independent foreign policy involving friendship with all and good                        relations with major powers US USSR                            PRC and Britain Last year also marked                        by strengthening of ties with Eastern Bloc and establishment of relations                        with East Germany North Korea and several African countries Shah does not                        aspire to major power status but he believes these initiatives enhance                        Irans prestige and role in world as country with friends in all camps which                        can make positive contribution to settlement of international problems Shah                        has also sought to improve relations with PRC and this policy is paying off handsomely as evidenced by                        forthright endorsement of Irans foreign and defense policies by Foreign                        Minister Chi during recent visit to Tehran4 Irans relations with the US continue to prosper In spite of Irans                        efforts to improve its relations with USSR and to establish or expand relations with Communist nations                        Shah continues to look on US as Irans closest and most trustworthy                        friend Progress has been achieved on several fronts US has moved ahead                        of Germany in the last year to become Irans largest trading partner Arms                        buildup based largely on purchases from US and on assignment of American                        military and civilian technicians to advise Iranians on buildup are                        progressing satisfactorily There are no important problems between our two                        countries and both of us continue to benefit significantly from this                        desirable state of affairs5 Perhaps even more important is new texture which has been introduced into                        our relations in last year and which gives them even greater substance This                        is sense of greater equality by Iran in its cooperative dealing with US                        This comes about because we have mastered tendency in recent years to                        secondguess Shah about his policies while Iran in turn has recovered from                        its client status attitude Turning point occurred when President came to                        Iran last May Important agreements were reached at that time regarding our                        willingness to assist Iran in its arms buildup but even more significant                        and lasting result of visit was acknowledgment that henceforth we would                        accord Iran right and wisdom to make                        decisions regarding its national security and other policies and stop                        questioning their merit Several events during year contributed to cement                        further this new cooperative relationship Shahs prompt agreement to                        Presidents request for transfer last fall of Iranian aircraft to Vietnam                        was one such exampleSee Foreign                                    Relations 19691976 volume E4 Documents on Iran and                                Iraq 19691972 Documents 224 and 226 While transaction                        posed some problems for Shah we surmise its net effect was to add another                        important and positive bond to our relations in that after many years of                        being on the receiving end of assistance Shah could now come to help of                        US in significant way When all of returns were in we believe Shah stood                        a little taller and our relations with Iran acquired even healthier                        basis6 In summary Shah will be coming to Washington as a close and good friend                        of US and as enlightened successful and confident Chief of State He will                        be accompanied by beautiful intelligent and popular Queen It is relevant                        in this regard to note Shahs visit will be brief He will of course be                        pleased with honors and ceremonies accorded him but his principal business                        will be talks with President Once this has been accomplished he will forego                        tours and sightseeing that customarily associated with such visits and                        return homeHelms,frus1969-76v27d20,"1.  THE SECRETARY MET WITH THE SHAH AT BLAIR HOUSE THE    SECRET  AFTERNOON OF JULY 24.  ALSO PRESENT WERE IRANIAN FOREIGN MINISTER KHALATBARI, IRANIAN AMBASSADOR ZAHEDI, ASSISTANT SECRETARY SISCO, AMBASSADOR HELMS, AND COUNTRY DIRECTOR MIKLOS.  \n2.  THE SHAH OPENED BY SAYING THAT RELATIONS BETWEEN OUR TWO COUNTRIES WERE SO GOOD AND THINGS WERE GOING SO SMOOTHLY THERE WAS REALLY NOTHING WE HAD TO TAKE UP BETWEEN US.  NEVERTHELESS HE WELCOMED THIS OPPORTUNITY TO EXCHANGE VIEWS WITH THE SECRETARY ON REGIONAL AND WORLD AFFAIRS.  \n3.  THE SECRETARY, REFERRING TO A CONVERSATION HE HAD WITH FOREIGN MINISTER KHALATBARI EARLIER IN THE DAY, COMMENTED THAT THE NEWS ABOUT SAUDI ARABIAS ATTITUDE TOWARD FURTHER COOPERATION WITH IRAN WAS NOT TOO ENCOURAG- ING.  THE SHAH REPLIED THAT HE HAD EXPECTED THIS OF KING FAISAL WHO IS A LITTLE OUT OF TOUCH WITH THINGS.  HE SAID THAT THERE ARE OTHER ELEMENTS IN SAUDI ARABIA THAT IRAN COULD WORK WITH, HOWEVER, AND THAT HE INTENDED TO CONTINUE EFFORTS TO COOPERATE WITH SAUDI ARABIA.  THE SECRETARY NOTED THAT FAISAL WAS CONCERNED ABOUT GROWING IRANIAN STRENGTH ALTHOUGH HE ALSO KNEW IT WAS IMPORTANT. THE SHAH REPLIED THAT FAISAL MUST KNOW THAT HE WISHED HIM AND HIS COUNTRY GOOD AND NOTHING ELSE.  \n4.  THE SHAH THEN TURNED TO THE QUESTION OF AFGHANISTAN AND COMMENTED THAT THE SOVIETS HAD HAD AN EASY TIME OF IT THERE.  HE SAID THAT APPARENTLY THEY COULD NOT ACCEPT A MORE NEUTRAL AFGHANISTAN AND IMPLIED THAT THE SOVIETS WERE IN SOME WAY INVOLVED IN THE RECENT COUP BY NOTING THAT IT WAS CARRIED OUT BY 50 OFFICERS ALL OF WHOM WERE SOVIET-TRAINED.  HE SAID THAT IF THE SOVIETS WANT TO BUILD ON THIS BY CREATING DIFFICULTIES IN PUSHTUNISTAN AND SHOULD TRY TO EXTEND THEIR INFLUENCE DOWN TO THE INDIAN OCEAN, THEN THAT WAS ""ANOTHER THING.""  \n5.  MOVING ON TO THE QUESTION OF U.S.-SOVIET DETENTE THE SHAH SAID HE THOUGHT OUR POLICY WAS SENSIBLE AND HE WELCOMED IT.  HE CAUTIONED, HOWEVER, THAT ONE MUST QUESTION WHETHER THE SOVIETS ARE BEING SO AGREEABLE    SECRET  BECAUSE THEY WISH A FREE HAND TO MAKE TROUBLE ELSEWHERE OR WHETHER THEY ARE MOTIVATED PRIMARILY BY THEIR CONCERNS ABOUT CHINA.  FOR HIS PART, HE SAID, HE CANNOT AFFORD TO TAKE CHANCES, IRAN MUST BE STRONG MILITARILY, SOCIALLY AND ECONOMICALLY.  THE PEOPLE, BOTH WORKERS AND PEASANTS, MUST HAVE A STAKE IN THE COUNTRY AND ITS FUTURE.  THAT IS WHY HE HAS LAWS WHICH PROVIDE FOR WORKERS TO BUY SHARES IN INDUSTRY AND, IF THEY DO NOT TAKE ALL OF THE SHARES OFFERED, THEY ARE MADE AVAILABLE TO SMALL LAND- OWNERS.  HE SAID THAT HE TOLD THE SOVIETS WHEN THEY ASKED ABOUT IRANS MILITARY BUILDUP THAT HE HAD THE SAME RIGHTS AS THEY OR ANY INDEPENDENT COUNTRY TO DO WHAT HE FELT WAS NECESSARY TO PROVIDE FOR HIS OWN SECURITY.  HE SAID ""I TOLD THEM THAT THEY SHOULD NOT CONSIDER US JUST ANOTHER MIDDLE EASTERN COUNTRY.  THEY MUST KNOW THAT WE CAN DESTROY ANY ONE OF THEIR SATELLITES.""  HE HASTENED TO ADD THAT IRAN WOULD NOT DO THIS, BUT THE FACT THAT EVERYONE KNOWS IT CAN IS THE BEST POSSIBLE DETERRENT TO ANY FOOLISHNESS ON THEIR PART.  \n6.  THE SECRETARY SAID THERE WERE OTHER THINGS TO CON- SIDER ABOUT THE SOVIETS.  THEY HAVE PROBLEMS IN THE FACT THAT SOME OF THE EASTERN EUROPEAN COUNTRIES ARE DOING BETTER THAN THEY, AND THIS IS AN UNCOMFORTABLE EXAMPLE FOR SOVIET LEADERS.  THEY NEED TECHNOLOGY BECAUSE CLEARLY THE U.S. AND OTHER COUNTRIES ARE WELL IN ADVANCE OF THE USSR.  THEY NEED TO DO BETTER IN IMPROVING THE ECONOMIC CONDITIONS OF THEIR OWN PEOPLE. THE SECRETARY SAID THAT HE FELT THAT IT WAS FOR THESE REASONS THAT THE SOVIETS HAD MADE A POLICY DECISION TO TRY TO GET ALONG WITH US.  HAVING SAID THIS, HOWEVER, HE DID NOT WANT TO DISCOUNT THE FACT THAT THE SOVIETS HAVE AND WILL CONTINUE TO LOOK FOR TARGETS OF OPPORTUNITY OR WEAKNESS TO EXPLOIT WHEN THEY CAN.  THUS WE AGREE WITH THE SHAH THAT IT IS STILL A MATTER OF GREAT IMPORTANCE THAT IRAN BE STRONG BECAUSE OTHER COUNTRIES IN HIS AREA CANNOT STAND ALONE.  THE SECRETARY SAID THAT AS OUR RELATIONS WITH THE SOVIETS DEVELOP WE HAVE TO BE CAUTIOUS ABOUT THE NATURE AND THE TERMS OF OUR EXCHANGE SO THAT WE DO NOT FIND THAT WE ARE GIVING THEM ADVANTAGES WITHOUT RECEIVING ANYTHING IN RETURN.  IN OTHER WORDS, DEVELOP-    SECRET  MENT OF A BETTER RELATIONSHIP IS A TWO-WAY STREET.  \n7.  IN COMMENTING ON ANOTHER ASPECT OF SOVIET BEHAVIOR AND HOW IT ILLUSTRATES THAT THE SOVIETS ARE NOT NECESSARILY OMNIPOTENT, THE SECRETARY REFERRED TO THE RECENT CONFERENCE ON SECURITY AND COOPERATION IN EUROPE HELD IN HELSINKI.  HE SAID THAT PRIOR TO THE MEETING SOME PEOPLE HAD BEEN WORRIED THAT THE SOVIETS WOULD BE ABLE TO CAPITALIZE ON IT, BUT THIS DID NOT PROVE TO BE THE CASE.  THERE WAS A FRIENDLY DEBATE AMONG THE WESTERN COUNTRIES, AND THE U.S. MADE IT CLEAR THAT IT WAS PRE- PARED TO SEE THE MEETING FAIL IF THE SOVIETS DIDNT COOPERATE.  HE THOUGHT THIS MADE THE SOVIETS UNCOMFORT- ABLE AND THAT THEY WERE IN A WEAKER POSITION BECAUSE THEIRS IS A CLOSED SOCIETY.  AS THE SOVIETS ARE EXPOSED IN- CREASINGLY TO THE FREE WORLD AND HOW IT OPERATES, THE SECRETARY SAID HE FEELS THIS WILLHAVE A SALUTARY EFFECT AND THAT THE SOVIETS WILL COME TO UNDERSTAND THE NECESSITY IF NOT THE DESIRABILITY OF FRIENDLIER DEBATE AND INTER- COURSE.  \n8.  THE SHAH AGREED THAT THERE ARE A NUMBER OF POSITIVE ASPECTS TO INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS AND ONE COULD BE RE- ASSURED ABOUT SOME OF THE THINGS THAT WERE EVIDENT IN EUROPE.  THE FRENCH WERE BASICALLY WORRIED ABOUT THE U.S. LEAVING EUROPE, THE SOVIETS CANT FOOL THE GERMANS, AND THE BRITISH UNDERSTAND THE SITUATION VERY WELL, ALTHOUGH ONE WONDERS ABOUT THE SCANDINAVIAN COUNTRIES AND ITALY.  HE NOTED IN PASSING THAT THE ITALIANS WANTED TO COME TO IRAN AND HE WILL SEE THEM IN THE FALL.  \n9.  HE SAID THAT, IN HIS CONVERSATION WITH THE PRESIDENT EARLIER IN THE DAY, HE HAD DISCUSSED THE IDEA OF A GAS PIPELINE TO TURKEY WITH THE LIQUIFICATION  PLANT THERE OR POSSIBLY A LINE THAT EXTENDS ALL THE WAY TO EUROPE. HE SAID THAT THIS COULD MOVE 40 BILLION  CUBIC METERS OF GAS TO EUROPE.  THIS IS NOT NEGLIGIBLE.  EVEN IF IT MEETS ONLY ONE-QUARTER OF EUROPES NEEDS, IT WILL GIVE EUROPE A VESTED INTEREST IN STABILITY LINKED WITH IRAN AND ITS PART OF THE WORLD GENERALLY.  THE SECRETARY AGREED THAT THIS COULD BE AN IMPORTANT DEVELOPMENT AND    SECRET  TIE.  COMING BACK TO REGIONAL AFFAIRS THE SHAH SAID HE CONTINUES TO WONDER WHY THE SOVIETS SEEM  TO WANT TO CREATE A VACUUM IN THE MIDDLE EAST (PRESUMABLY REFERRING TO SOVIET QUESTIONING OF IRANS MILITARY BUILDUP FOLLOWING BRITISH WITHDRAWAL FROM THE PERSIAN GULF.)  HE ASKED RHETORICALLY, WHY ARE THEY BEEFING UP FAVORED NEIGHBORS AND COMMENTED THAT IRAN CANT TAKE CHANCES, PARTICULARLY AFTER AFGHANISTAN.  HE SAID HE TOLD INDIAN FOREIGN MINISTER SWARAN SINGH THAT IRAN WOULD NOT ENCOURAGE PAKISTAN AGAINST INDIA BUT ON THE OTHER HAND HE COULD NOT TOLERATE THE FURTHER DISMEMBERMENT OF PAKISTAN.  HE SAID INDIA WILL HAVE TO ACCEPT IRAN AS IT IS.  IRAN CAN COOPERATE WITH INDIA IN MANY CONSTRUCTIVE WAYS.  FOR EXAMPLE, EXPANSION OF THE INDIAN-IRANIAN REFINERY AT MADRAS.  HE ADDED THAT THE INDIANS HAVE GOT TO ""SHUT UP"" AND STOP PREACHING TO US.  THEY HAVE A DEPLORABLE HABIT OF MORALIZING TO THE REST OF THE WORLD.  \n0.  HE SAID THAT THE SOVIETS HAD ALSO TRIED TO PREACH TO HIM IN MUCH THE SAME WAY AND HE HAD TOLD THEM THE SAME THING.  HE SAID HE DID NOT THINK THE SOVIETS WILL REALLY TAKE ANY OVERTLY AGGRESSIVE STEPS BECAUSE THEY KNOW THIS WILL INVOLVE THE REST OF THE WORLD.  THERE IS THE DANGER OF SUBVERSION, HOWEVER.  THEREFORE, IRAN IS FIRM IN ITS CONCLUSION THAT IT MUST BE STRONG ENOUGHTO TAKE CARE OF IRAQ OR ANYBODY ELSE IN A FEW HOURS BECAUSE IT CANNOT SIT AROUND AND WAIT FOR THE DISPUTE TO GET INTO THE UN WHERE IT WOULD BE DEBATED INTERMINABLY.  \n1.  MR. SISCO SAID THAT WE HAD TALKED WITH THE FRENCH RECENTLY AND THEY FELT THAT THERE WAS SOME EVIDENCE THAT IRAQ IS TRYING TO PUT SOME LIGHT BETWEEN THEMSELVES AND THE SOVIETS.  HE ASKED FOR THE SHAHS COMMENTS.  THE SHAH APPEARED SKEPTICAL BY ASKING WHAT ABOUT THE BAATH AND THE COMMUNISTS GETTING TOGETHER AND WHAT ABOUT BAGHDAD TRYING TO GET THE KURDS INTO SOME SORT OF COALITION.  HE SAID, ""WE ARE PREVENTING THIS AT THE MOMENT.""  NEVERTHE- LESS, HE DOES NOT WANT TO CLOSE THE DOOR TO IRAQ AND IS WILLING TO GIVE IT THE BENIFIT OF THE DOUBT. LET THEM THROW OUT THE SOVIETS IF THEY CAN, BUT HE IS DUBIOUS. ALSO,\n",839967

      our relations in last year and which gives them even greater substance This                        is sense of greater equality by Iran in its cooperative dealing with US                        This comes about because we have mastered tendency in recent years to                        secondguess Shah about his policies while Iran in turn has recovered from                        its client status attitude Turning point occurred when President came to                        Iran last May Important agreements were reached at that time regarding our                        willingness to assist Iran in its arms buildup but even more significant                        and lasting result of visit was acknowledgment that henceforth we would                        accord Iran right and wisdom to make                        decisions regarding its national security and other policies and stop                        questioning their merit Several events during year contributed to

While transaction                        posed some problems for Shah we surmise its net effect was to add another                        important and positive bond to our relations in that after many years of                        being on the receiving end of assistance Shah could now come to help of                        US in significant way When all of returns were in we believe Shah stood                        a little taller and our relations with Iran acquired even healthier                        basis6 In summary Shah will be coming to Washington as a close and good friend                        of US and as enlightened successful and confident Chief of State He will                        be accompanied by beautiful intelligent and popular Queen It is relevant

  will be talks with President Once this has been accomplished he will forego                        tours and sightseeing that customarily associated with such visits and

ON JULY 17 FOREIGN MINISTER KHALATBARI, AT INSTRUCTION OF SHAH, INFORMED ME OF AUDIENCE SOVIET AMBASSADOR HAD HAD WITH SHAH THAT MORNING.\n2.  SOVIET AMBASSADOR HAD REQUESTED AUDIENCE ON INSTRUCTIONS FROM PRIME MINISTER KOSYGIN TO RAISE TWO ISSUES: (1) SOVIET CONCERN OVER ARMS PURCHASES PRINCIPALLY BY IRAN BUT ALSO BY KUWAIT AND SAUDI ARABIA AND (2) THE RESURGENCE OF CENTO AS ACTIVE MILITARY ALLIANCE.\n3.  IN REPLYING ON ITEM (1) IN PARA 2 ABOVE, THE SHAH REACTED STRONGLY.  HE INFORMED THE AMBASSADOR THAT WHATEVER HE MIGHT HAVE READ ABOUT IRANIAN ARMS PURCHASES WAS NOT ACCURATE.  IRAN INTENDED TO BUY QUOTE MUCH MORE UNQUOTE THAN THE SOVIETS KNEW.  HE THEN CHIDED THE AMBASSADOR FOR PRESUMING TO RAISE SUCH AN ISSUE WITH A SOVEREIGN STATE.  HE LAID IT ON THE LINE ABOUT SOVIET MILITARY AID TO SYRIA AND IRAQ, POINTED OUT THE SIZE OF THE INDIAN ARMY SUPPORTED BY SOVIET WEAPONRY, AND ASKED THE SOVIET AMBASSADOR POINTBLANK WHAT RIGHT HE HAD TO TALK ABOUT MILITARY BUILDUP AGAINST THE BACKGROUND OF WHAT THE SOVIETS    SECRET\n4.  AS FOR POINT (2) IN PARA 2 ABOVE, THE SHAH POINTED OUT TO THE AMBASSADOR THAT A STRONG IRAN, TURKEY, AND PAKISTAN CONSTITUTED A STABILIZING FACTOR TO THE SOUTH OF RUSSIA AND WOULD BE A BULWARK AGAINST ADVENTURISM IN THE AREA.  HE PLAYED THIS SCENARIO IN SUCH A WAY AS TO LEAVE THE DISTINCT IMPRESSION THAT CENTO WAS REALLY INSURANCE AGAINST CHINESE INTRUSION INTO THIS PART OF THE WORLD, ALTHOUGH CHINA WAS NOT RPT NOT SPECIFICALLY MENTIONED. HE UNDERLINED THAT A ""STRONG IRAN"" WOULD BE ""A WISE IRAN"" AND WOULD MAKE PROBLEMS FOR NO ONE INCLUDING THE SOVIET UNION.\n5.  WHEN HE HAD FINISHED HIS RECITAL TO ME, KHALATBARI COMMENTED, QUOTE THE SHAH WAS TOUGH, AND AS HE PROCEEDED, THE SOVIET AMBASSADORS FACE GOT LONGER AND LONGER.  HE WAS LEFT UNDER NO ILLUSIONS ABOUT THE SHS DISPLEASURE OVER HIS DEMARCHE UNQUOTE. HELMS\n",848262

               other businessmen are beating paths to Tehran to negotiate vast variety of                        economic and business arrangements which will further move this country forward and provide more balanced                        economy against day when Irans oil reserves will be depleted Lengthy and                        complex negotiations with oil consortium have been successfully completed                        and new oil arrangements have been established which Shah believes to be                        mutually advantageous to Iran and consortium and which

countries Shah does not                        aspire to major power status but he believes these initiatives enhance                        Irans prestige and role in world as country with friends in all camps which                        can make positive contribution to settlement of international problems Shah                        has also sought to improve relations with PRC and this policy is paying off handsomely as evidenced by                        forthright endorsement of Irans foreign and defense policies by Foreign                        Minister Chi during recent visit to

JAIN TOLD POL COUNSELOR HE WAS GOING TO SEE FOREIGNMINISTER SWARAN SINGH AND WOULD ATTEMPT MEET WITH MRS.

JAIN FOLLOWED UP HIS INTERVIEW WITH SHAH (REF A) WITH FEATURE STORY JULY 4 ARGUING THAT SHAHS DESIRE FOR FRIENDLY RELATIONS WITH INDIA STEMMED FROM IRANIAN SEARCH FOR TIES WITH NATIONS OUTSIDE ARAB ME. INDIA HAD MUCH TO GAIN FROM ""UNFREEZING"" ITS RELATIONS WITH IRAN AND SHAH ""IS SENSIBLE ENOUGH TO RECOGNIZE HE CANNOT EXPECT INDIA TO WEAKEN ITS TIES WITH EITHER MOSCOW OR BAGHDAD OR BOTH AS A PRECONDITION FOR COOPERATION BETWEEN THE TWO COUNTRIES."" FOR ITS PART, INDIA ""SHOULD AT LEAST APPRECIATE DILEMMA OF IRANS RULING ELITE AND RECOGNIZE ITS INTENTION NOT TO ALLOW ITSELF TO BE DRAGGED INTO CONFLICTS OF SUBCONTINENT EXCEPT PERHAPS AS MEDIATOR, BUT TO SUE PAKISTAN AS LEVER IN ITS STRUGGLE WITH RADICAL ARABS.""\n3.

AT THE MIDDLE-LEVEL (JOINT SECRETARY), OFFICIALS DO ATTEMPT TO DOWNPLAY THE LEVEL OF THEIR RELATIONS WITH IRAQ, AND PROTEST THAT INDIA HAS PUBLICLY SAID IT WISHES BETTER RELATIONS WITH IRAN. (REF B &amp; C)  BUT THEY RE- PEATEDLY FOCUS ON ANTI-INDIAN ARTICLES IN THE IRANIAN PRESS, THEIR SUSPICIONTHAT THESE ARE FED FROM THE IRANIAN FOREIGN MINISTRY, AND CLAIM THAT THE SHAH HAS MADE CLEAR TO THEIR AMBASSADOR IN TEHRAN THAT HE DOES NOT WANT ANY HIGH-LEVEL EXCHANGES OF VISITS WITH INDIA UNTIL THE INDO-PAK-BANGLADESH RELATIONSHIP, PARTICULARLY POWS, IS STRAIGHTNED OUT.

is first of two messages on Shahs                        forthcoming visit to US This message seeks to describe current status of                        USIranian relations and Shahs perceptions of these relations Second                        message will deal with topics Shah may raise with PresidentDocument 21End summary1 When President visited Iran just over year ago Shah characterized                        USIranian relations as never having been better We feel confident in                        saying Shah will be arriving in US at time when relations are even better                        and more solidly based than ever before Further President will be                        receiving a friendly and seasoned Chief of State who is at height of his                        power fully confident about wisdom of his policies and direction he is                        taking his country and justifiably proud of Irans and his remarkable                        achievements Shah values his friendship and meeting with President and                        looks forward to comparing notes and further developing close relationship                        and cooperation between US and Iran which are important to Shah and which                        help him guide his country into assuming greater role and responsibilities                        in this troubled part of the worldin best tradition of Nixon Doctrine2 During year since Presidents visit here Shah and Iran have moved from                        strength to strength domestically country remains politically stable and                        economy continues to develop vigorously Massive new Fifth Plan has just                        been launched over three times size of Fourth Plan calling for 36 billion                        investment in countrys future However dynamism of Iranian economy and of                        Shahs outlook are such that Shah has started talking about overhauling Plan                        as already too modest for his goals Attracted by Irans political stability                        and economic prospects American British French German Japanese and                        other businessmen are beating paths to Tehran to negotiate vast variety of                        economic and business arrangements which will further move this country forward and provide more balanced                        economy against day when Irans oil reserves will be depleted Lengthy and                        complex negotiations with oil consortium have been successfully completed                        and new oil arrangements have been established which Shah believes to be                        mutually advantageous to Iran and consortium and which should ensure secure                        supplies to consumers and substantial income to Iran Typically Shah is                        looking forward to new areas of development such as Irans extensive gas                        reserves3 On international front Shah is moving ahead energetically to gain further                        recognition and respect for Iran as stable and responsible member of                        international community In last year he has received world figures and has                        visited several important capitals He is embarked on what he calls                        independent foreign policy involving friendship with all and good                        relations with major powers US USSR                            PRC and Britain Last year also marked                        by strengthening of ties with Eastern Bloc and establishment of relations                        with East Germany North Korea and several African countries Shah does not                        aspire to major power status but he believes these initiatives enhance                        Irans prestige and role in world as country with friends in all camps which                        can make positive contribution to settlement of international problems Shah                        has also sought to improve relations with PRC and this policy is paying off handsomely as evidenced by                        forthright endorsement of Irans foreign and defense policies by Foreign                        Minister Chi during recent visit to Tehran4 Irans relations with the US continue to prosper In spite of Irans                        efforts to improve its relations with USSR and to establish or expand relations with Communist nations                        Shah continues to look on US as Irans closest and most trustworthy                        friend Progress has been achieved on several fronts US has moved ahead                        of Germany in the last year to become Irans largest trading partner Arms                        buildup based largely on purchases from US and on assignment of American                        military and civilian technicians to advise Iranians on buildup are                        progressing satisfactorily There are no important problems between our two                        countries and both of us continue to benefit significantly from this                        desirable state of affairs5 Perhaps even more important is new texture which has been introduced into                        our relations in last year and which gives them even greater substance This                        is sense of greater equality by Iran in its cooperative dealing with US                        This comes about because we have mastered tendency in recent years to                        secondguess Shah about his policies while Iran in turn has recovered from                        its client

        theretoSummary: This is second of two messages dealing with                        Shahs visit to US This message lists subjects which Shah may raise with                        President and high USG officials he will be                        meeting during visit1 Summit Meeting and Dtente: Shah is uneasy about                        implications for Iran and this general area of dtente between Soviet Union                        and West particularly United States In spite of surface cordiality of                        IranianSoviet relations Shah harbors deep distrust of USSR and reasons that dtente with West will                        release energies and resources for Soviet machinations in Middle East and                        especially in vital Persian Gulf Arabian Peninsula and Iraq Recurrent                        theme in Iran these days is that dtente should be worldwide and if achieved                        in one part of the world it should not be at expense of security of nations                        in other areas Moreover Shah feels that in atmosphere of dtente US may                        take more tolerant view of Soviet effort to enhance its position in this                        region than would otherwise be the case He is concerned that we may let                        down our psychological guard to ultimate detriment of Iranian interests He                        has on several occasions recently expressed to ranking USG officials his concern over agreements                        which may have been reached between President and Brezhnev that might have bearing on Irans                        vital interests Secretarys assurances to him on 9 June were noted but he                        will want to be reassured State 118336Document 192 Accordingly Shah will be most interested in hearing from President about                        summit meeting including not only any discussions or understandings reached                        concerning Persian Gulf and Middle East but also more generally such                        subjects as prospects for dtente in Europe progress of SALT CSCE and MBFR talks etc Shah will also look forward to Presidents                        view on how US regards Soviet activities in the Middle East aimed at                        securing dominant position in Gulf and Indian Ocean areaHe undoubtedly hopes US is prepared publicly as well as privately to take                        firm position with Soviets that US will stand firm on Soviet effort to                        expand its influence in Middle East Persian Gulf and Indian Ocean regions                        and he may tell President that if we are steadfast in these areas USG can count on Iran to cooperate fully with                        us3 Relations with China: Iran has been pushing hard to                        improve its relations with Peking and its success can be measured by                        reassuring support which PRC is giving to                        Iranian position on rearmament and Persian Gulf At present Iran welcomes                        what appears to be growing Chinese interest in this region both as a force                        to check Soviet ambitions and also to shore up Pakistan about which Shah                        is deeply concerned Accordingly improving relations between Peking and                        Washington are seen here in highly favorable light Shah will be greatly                        interested in current status and direction of our Chinese relations He will                        welcome anything we can say on this subject as well as status and trends as                        we see them of PekingMoscow relations4 Persian Gulf Arabian Peninsula Iraq ArabIsraeli                            Dispute and Energy Crisis: This complex of subjects is increasingly                        interrelated in Shahs mind He may advance but in low key his well known                        thesis that peace and stability within the Persian Gulf should be the sole                        responsibility of the littoral states This thesis is consistent with public                        and private statements we have made to effect that Gulf states should                        cooperate for their own security At same time Shah would like reassurance                        on how we see our interests and commitments in the Gulf He has not urged                        US to involve itself directly in problems of area but he welcomes US                        willingness to provide Saudi Arabia and Kuwait with sophisticated weapons                        However he remains worried about insurrection at Dhofar trouble between                        the two Yemens fragility of UAE and what                        he considers relative weakness and fecklessness of Saudi Arabia under King                            Faisal In this context it                        would be useful to suggest to Shah that in his commendable efforts to                        improve relations between Iran and Arab states on other side of Gulf it is                        incumbent on Iran as by far strongest power to reassure Saudi Arabia of                        Iranian intentions and to take lead in seeking closer cooperation                        particularly between Iran and Saudi Arabia Foreign Minister Khalatbaris trip to Jidda is welcome step                        in this directionA description of Khalatbaris trip to Jidda which

        theretoSummary: This is second of two messages dealing with                        Shahs visit to US This message lists subjects which Shah may raise with                        President and high USG officials he will be                        meeting during visit1 Summit Meeting and Dtente: Shah is uneasy about                        implications for Iran and this general area of dtente between Soviet Union                        and West particularly United States In spite of surface cordiality of                        IranianSoviet relations Shah harbors deep distrust of USSR and reasons that dtente with West will                        release energies and resources for Soviet machinations in Middle East and                        especially in vital Persian Gulf Arabian Peninsula and Iraq Recurrent                        theme in Iran these days is that dtente should be worldwide and if achieved                        in one part of the world it should not be at expense of security of nations                        in other areas Moreover Shah feels that in atmosphere of dtente US may                        take more tolerant view of Soviet effort to enhance its position in this                        region than would otherwise be the case He is concerned that we may let                        down our psychological guard to ultimate detriment of Iranian interests He                        has on several occasions recently expressed to ranking USG officials his concern over agreements                        which may have been reached between President and Brezhnev that might have bearing on Irans                        vital interests Secretarys assurances to him on 9 June were noted but he                        will want to be reassured State 118336Document 192 Accordingly Shah will be most interested in hearing from President about                        summit meeting including not only any discussions or understandings reached                        concerning Persian Gulf and Middle East but also more generally such                        subjects as prospects for dtente in Europe progress of SALT CSCE and MBFR talks etc Shah will also look forward to Presidents                        view on how US regards Soviet activities in the Middle East aimed at                        securing dominant position in Gulf and Indian Ocean areaHe undoubtedly hopes US is prepared publicly as well as privately to take                        firm position with Soviets that US will stand firm on Soviet effort to                        expand its influence in Middle East Persian Gulf and Indian Ocean regions                        and he may tell President that if we are steadfast in these areas USG can count on Iran to cooperate fully with                        us3 Relations with China: Iran has been pushing hard to                        improve its relations with Peking and its success can be measured by                        reassuring support which PRC is giving to                        Iranian position on rearmament and Persian Gulf At present Iran welcomes                        what appears to be growing Chinese interest in this region both as a force                        to check Soviet ambitions and also to shore up Pakistan about which Shah                        is deeply concerned Accordingly improving relations between Peking and                        Washington are seen here in highly favorable light Shah will be greatly                        interested in current status and direction of our Chinese relations He will                        welcome anything we can say on this subject as well as status and trends as                        we see them of PekingMoscow relations4 Persian Gulf Arabian Peninsula Iraq ArabIsraeli                            Dispute and Energy Crisis: This complex of subjects is increasingly                        interrelated in Shahs mind He may advance but in low key his well known                        thesis that peace and stability within the Persian Gulf should be the sole                        responsibility of the littoral states This thesis is consistent with public                        and private statements we have made to effect that Gulf states should                        cooperate for their own security At same time Shah would like reassurance                        on how we see our interests and commitments in the Gulf He has not urged                        US to involve itself directly in problems of area but he welcomes US                        willingness to provide Saudi Arabia and Kuwait with sophisticated weapons                        However he remains worried about insurrection at Dhofar trouble between                        the two Yemens fragility of UAE and what                        he considers relative weakness and fecklessness of Saudi Arabia under King                            Faisal In this context it                        would be useful to suggest to Shah that in his commendable efforts to                        improve relations between Iran and Arab states on other side of Gulf it is                        incumbent on Iran as by far strongest power to reassure Saudi Arabia of                        Iranian intentions and to take lead in seeking closer cooperation

will be interested in any assessments we have                        of status and direction of SovietIraq relations6 ArabIsraeli Dispute: Shah will express his concern                        that current impasse may lead Arabs to desperate acts and play into hands of                        Soviets He can be expected to urge more evenhanded US policy in area and                        reactivation of Rogers Plan in some form7 Pakistan: In year since Presidents visit here Shah                        has become increasingly concerned about Pakistan and maintenance of its                        integrity Shah feels that we are not doing enough for Pakistan and will                        probably urge that we be more responsive to Pakistans requests for military                        assistance Shah will of course be interested in having Presidents views                        on Pakistan and its future in the wake of Bhuttos visit to Washington8 Oil: Shah will almost certainly raise subject of                        oil He is pleased at outcome of oil negotiations with consortium and is                        embarked on negotiations with several countries for Iranian refined                        products In addition NIOC is in last                        stages of negotiating with Ashland Oil Company of Kentucky public                        knowledge and with Apco Oil Company of New York still confidential for                        equity participation in existing oil refineries in the US to be bought                        with guaranteed crude supplies Shah is also very perhaps even excessively                        optimistic about future of Iranian gas and we have a long lead here with                        US company International System and Control of Houston having formed                        Kalingas which will almost certainly be producing Irans first LNG exports He will push for further such                        projects On hardy perennial question of increased oil exports to US we                        can at last be completely forthcoming following Presidents energy                            messagePresident Nixon

        theretoSummary: This is second of two messages dealing with                        Shahs visit to US This message lists subjects which Shah may raise with                        President and high USG officials he will be                        meeting during visit1 Summit Meeting and Dtente: Shah is uneasy about                        implications for Iran and this general area of dtente between Soviet Union                        and West particularly United States In spite of surface cordiality of                        IranianSoviet relations Shah harbors deep distrust of USSR and reasons that dtente with West will                        release energies and resources for Soviet machinations in Middle East and                        especially in vital Persian Gulf Arabian Peninsula and Iraq Recurrent                        theme in Iran these days is that dtente should be worldwide and if achieved                        in one part of the world it should not be at expense of security of nations                        in other areas Moreover Shah feels that in atmosphere of dtente US may                        take more tolerant view of Soviet effort to enhance its position in this                        region than would otherwise be the case He is concerned that we may let                        down our psychological guard to ultimate detriment of Iranian interests He                        has on several occasions recently expressed to ranking USG officials his concern over agreements                        which may have been reached between President and Brezhnev that might have bearing on Irans                        vital interests Secretarys assurances to him on 9 June were noted but he                        will want to be reassured State 118336Document 192 Accordingly Shah will be most interested in hearing from President about                        summit meeting including not only any discussions or understandings reached                        concerning Persian Gulf and Middle East but also more generally such                        subjects as prospects for dtente in Europe progress of SALT CSCE and MBFR talks etc Shah will also look forward to Presidents                        view on how US regards Soviet activities in the Middle East aimed at                        securing dominant position in Gulf and Indian Ocean areaHe undoubtedly hopes US is prepared publicly as well as privately to take                        firm position with Soviets that US will stand firm on Soviet effort to                        expand its influence in Middle East Persian Gulf and Indian Ocean regions                        and he may tell President that if we are steadfast in these areas USG can count on Iran to cooperate fully with                        us3 Relations with China: Iran has been pushing hard to                        improve its relations with Peking and its success can be measured by                        reassuring support which PRC is giving to                        Iranian position on rearmament and Persian Gulf At present Iran welcomes                        what appears to be growing Chinese interest in this region both as a force                        to check Soviet ambitions and also to shore up Pakistan about which Shah                        is deeply concerned Accordingly improving relations between Peking and                        Washington are seen here in highly favorable light Shah will be greatly                        interested in current status and direction of our Chinese relations He will                        welcome anything we can say on this subject as well as status and trends as                        we see them of PekingMoscow relations4 Persian Gulf Arabian Peninsula Iraq ArabIsraeli                            Dispute and Energy Crisis: This complex of subjects is increasingly                        interrelated in Shahs mind He may advance but in low key his well known                        thesis that peace and stability within the Persian Gulf should be the sole                        responsibility of the littoral states This thesis is consistent with public                        and private statements we have made to effect that Gulf states should                        cooperate for their own security At same time Shah would like reassurance                        on how we see our interests and commitments in the Gulf He has not urged                        US to involve itself directly in problems of area but he welcomes US                        willingness to provide Saudi Arabia and Kuwait with sophisticated weapons                        However he remains worried about insurrection at Dhofar trouble between                        the two Yemens fragility of UAE and what                        he considers relative weakness and fecklessness of Saudi Arabia under King                            Faisal In this context it                        would be useful to suggest to Shah that in his commendable efforts to                        improve relations between Iran and Arab states on other side of Gulf it is                        incumbent on Iran as by far strongest power to reassure Saudi Arabia of                        Iranian intentions and to take lead in seeking closer cooperation                        particularly between Iran and Saudi Arabia Foreign Minister Khalatbaris trip to Jidda is welcome step                        in this directionA description of Khalatbaris trip to Jidda which was                            intended to deepen SaudiIranian cooperation in the Gulf is in                            telegrams 4400 from Tehran June 21 and 2619 from Jidda June 24

JAIN SAID GOI WOULD WELCOME INVITATION TO SEND SENIOR OFFCIALS TO IRAN TO MEET WITH IRANIAN OFFICIALS AND SHAH. JAIN TOLD POL COUNSELOR HE WAS GOING TO SEE FOREIGNMINISTER SWARAN SINGH AND WOULD ATTEMPT MEET WITH MRS. GANDHI AND WOULD ENCOURAGE THEM TO INITIATE CORRESPONDENCE WITH SHAH FOLLOWING UP ON SHAHS COMMENTS TO JAIN. (FOR SIMILAR BRITISH SUGGESTION, SEE REF D). POL COUNSELOR TOLD JAIN HE THOUGHT THAT EXCELLENT IDEA AND WISHED HIM WELL.\n2. JAIN FOLLOWED UP HIS INTERVIEW WITH SHAH (REF A) WITH FEATURE STORY JULY 4 ARGUING THAT SHAHS DESIRE FOR FRIENDLY RELATIONS WITH INDIA STEMMED FROM IRANIAN SEARCH FOR TIES WITH NATIONS OUTSIDE ARAB ME. INDIA HAD MUCH TO GAIN FROM ""UNFREEZING"" ITS RELATIONS WITH IRAN AND SHAH ""IS SENSIBLE ENOUGH TO RECOGNIZE HE CANNOT EXPECT INDIA TO WEAKEN ITS TIES WITH EITHER MOSCOW OR BAGHDAD OR BOTH AS A PRECONDITION FOR COOPERATION BETWEEN THE TWO COUNTRIES."" FOR ITS PART, INDIA ""SHOULD AT LEAST APPRECIATE DILEMMA OF IRANS RULING ELITE AND RECOGNIZE ITS INTENTION NOT TO ALLOW ITSELF TO BE DRAGGED INTO CONFLICTS OF SUBCONTINENT EXCEPT PERHAPS AS MEDIATOR, BUT TO SUE PAKISTAN AS LEVER IN ITS STRUGGLE WITH RADICAL ARABS.""\n3. EDITORIAL IN HINDUSTAN TIMES JULY 4 SAID INDIAN FEARS OF IRANIAN ARMS FILTERING THROUGH PAKISTAN TO BE USED AGAINST INDIA WERE EXAGGERATED.

OUR OWN CONVERSATIONS IN THE FOREIGN MINISTRY DO NOT SUGGEST QUITE THE SAME DEGREE OF OPTIMISM ABOUT IMPROVING INDO-IRANIAN RELATIONS THAT JAIN SAYS HE FOUND. AT THE MIDDLE-LEVEL (JOINT SECRETARY), OFFICIALS DO ATTEMPT TO DOWNPLAY THE LEVEL OF THEIR RELATIONS WITH IRAQ, AND PROTEST THAT INDIA HAS PUBLICLY SAID IT WISHES BETTER RELATIONS WITH IRAN. (REF B &amp; C)  BUT THEY RE- PEATEDLY FOCUS ON ANTI-INDIAN ARTICLES IN THE IRANIAN PRESS, THEIR SUSPICIONTHAT THESE ARE FED FROM THE IRANIAN FOREIGN MINISTRY, AND CLAIM THAT THE SHAH HAS MADE CLEAR TO THEIR AMBASSADOR IN TEHRAN THAT HE DOES NOT WANT ANY HIGH-LEVEL EXCHANGES OF VISITS WITH INDIA UNTIL THE INDO-PAK-BANGLADESH RELATIONSHIP, PARTICULARLY POWS, IS STRAIGHTNED OUT.

Chinese relations He will                        welcome anything we can say on this subject as well as status and trends as                        we see them of PekingMoscow relations4 Persian Gulf Arabian Peninsula Iraq ArabIsraeli                            Dispute and Energy Crisis: This complex of subjects is increasingly                        interrelated in Shahs mind He may advance but in low key his well known                        thesis that peace and stability within the Persian Gulf should be the sole                        responsibility of the littoral states This thesis is consistent with public                        and private statements we have made to effect that Gulf states should                        cooperate for their own security At same time Shah would like reassurance                        on how we see our interests and commitments in the Gulf He has not urged                        US to involve itself directly in problems of area but he welcomes US                        willingness to provide Saudi Arabia and Kuwait with sophisticated weapons                        However he remains worried about insurrection at Dhofar trouble between                        the two Yemens fragility of UAE and what                        he considers relative weakness and fecklessness of Saudi Arabia under King                            Faisal In this context it                        would be useful to suggest to Shah that in his commendable efforts to                        improve relations between Iran and Arab states on other side of Gulf it is                        incumbent on Iran as by far strongest power to reassure Saudi Arabia of                        Iranian intentions and to take lead in seeking closer cooperation                        particularly between Iran and Saudi Arabia Foreign Minister Khalatbaris trip to Jidda is welcome step                        in this directionA description of Khalatbaris trip to Jidda which

activities of Iraq allied with Soviet Union We have passed                        to GOI substance of various reports                        suggesting that honeymoon between Soviet Union and Iraq is over but he has                        countered with information suggesting Soviet influence in Iraq is increasing                        Tehran 4475Document                                218 Shah will be interested in any assessments we have                        of status and direction of SovietIraq relations6 ArabIsraeli Dispute: Shah will express his concern                        that current impasse may lead Arabs to desperate acts and play into hands of                        Soviets He can be expected to urge more evenhanded US policy in area and                        reactivation of Rogers Plan in some form7 Pakistan: In year since Presidents visit here Shah                        has become increasingly concerned about Pakistan and maintenance of its                        integrity Shah feels that we are not doing enough for Pakistan and will                        probably urge that we be more responsive to Pakistans requests for military                        assistance Shah will of course be interested in having Presidents views                        on Pakistan and its future in the wake of Bhuttos visit to Washington8 Oil: Shah will almost certainly raise subject of                        oil He is pleased at outcome of oil negotiations with consortium and is                        embarked on negotiations with several countries for Iranian refined                        products In addition NIOC is in last                        stages of negotiating with Ashland Oil Company of Kentucky public                        knowledge and with Apco Oil Company of New York still confidential for                        equity participation in existing oil refineries in the US to be bought                        with guaranteed crude supplies Shah is also very perhaps even excessively                        optimistic about future of Iranian gas and we have a long lead here with                        US company International System and Control of Houston having formed                        Kalingas which will almost certainly be producing Irans first LNG exports He will push for further such                        projects On hardy perennial question of increased oil exports to US we                        can at last be completely forthcoming following Presidents energy                            messagePresident Nixon delivered a special message to                            Congress on energy on April 18 The text of the Presidents message and                            his remarks on transmitting the message to Congress are in Public Papers: Nixon 1973 pages 301319 Shah will be                        interested in evolving USUSSR relations                        on gas and oil and may wish compare notes on

IN TALK WITH COURT MIME TER ALAM MORNING 16 JULY, PROBED FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ON SUBJECT PARA TWO OF REFTEL. ALAM CONFIRMED THAT DEVELOPMENTAL ASSISTANCE WOULD BE GIVEN JORDAN BUT THAT NO RPT NO AID OR ARMS WERE IN THE PICTURE. HE DID NOT RPT NOT SPECIFY EXTENT OF DEVELOPMENTAL ASSISTANCE, AND IT APPEARED AS IF HE DID NOT REALLY KNOW PRECISE DETAILS.\n2. IN DEVEOPING FURTHER ON SHAHS CONCERNS ABOUT JORDAN, ALAM SAID THAT THE SHAHS DESCRIPTION IS, ""JORDAN HAS NOTHING EXCEPT THE MORALE OF ITS MONARCH AND THE MORALE OF ITS ARMY."" ACCORDING TO ALAM, THE SHAH SEEMS TO LEAN IN THE DIRECTION  OF ATTEMPTING TO ARRANGE FOR SUBSIDIES FROM KUWAIT AND SAUDIA ARABIA TO HELP JORDAN WITH ITS MILITARY PURCHASES. HOW HE EXPECTS TO ACHIEVE CONFIDENTIAL THIS IS NOT RPT NOT CLEAR, BUT HE MAY DEVELOP ON THE THEME WHEN HE MEETS WITH THE PRESIDENT. DEPENDENCE OF JORDAN ON FOREIGN FINANCIAL RESOURCES, MOST PARTICULARLY THE UNITED STATES, IS PROBLEM WHICH SHAH RECOGNIZES, AND IT MAY WELL BE THAT AS PRACTICAL MATTER HE FORESEES THE TWO WEALTHY ARAB COUNTRIES MENTIONED AS THE ONES WHICH SHOULD BE PERSUADED TO COME TO JORDANS ASSISTANCE.

FOLLOWING ARE UNINT S COMMENTS ON ITEMS LISTED IN PARA ONE OF REFTEL. ( A)  ONLY AGREEMENT WE ARE AWARE OF RE MINISTRY OF  INTERIOR WAS CONCLUDED WITH TT AASLOVAKIA IN DECEMBER 1972 ( BAGHDAD 81).  AS MENTIONED AT TIME,  IT WAS BELIEVED IRAQIS WANTED TO PROFIT FROM COMMUNIST EXPERIENCE IN THIS AREA, PARTICULARLY TECHNICAL SECURITY ITEMS. ( B)  USINT NOT AWARE OF SPECIFIC TRADE UNION CONFERENCE,  BUT IRAQI TRADE UNIONS LIKE ALL OTHER PUBLIC ORGANIZATIONS,  INCLUDING COMMUNIST PARTY, ARE EITHER DIRECTLY CONTROLLED BY BAATH OR CLOSELY WATCHED BY THEM. ( C) 1,000  FIGURE FOR SOVIET TECHNICIANS IS AS GOOD A GUESS AS ANY. ( D)  COMMUNISTS HAVE IN EFFECT ACCEPTED BAATH DOMINATED NATIONAL FRONT FOR OVER A YEAR AND THEY HAVE TWO FIGUREHEAD MINISTERS IN CABINET.  ADDITIONAL AGREEMENT MAY HAVE BEEN REACHED,  BUT THIS DOES NOT NECESSARILY MEAN BAATH IS GOING TO PERMIT ICP ANY MORE FREEDOM OF ACTION. ( E)  ITALIANS AND FRENCH BOTH HAVE HEARD REPORT THAT IRAQ WILL RECEIVE UP TO ONE SQUADRON OF TU-22  OR SOME TYPE SOVIET BOMBER.  FACT     SECRET\n2.  COMMENT:  THERE IS SOMETHING OF SELF- FULFILLING PROPHECY TO SHAH S ANALYSIS THAT IRAQ COULD BECOME SOVIET SATELITE.  IF IRAN RESISTS IRAQI OVERTURES FOR DETENTE, CONTINUES TO GIVE\n3.  ANALYSIS OF BEST INFORMED AMBASSADORS --  ALGERIAN,  EGYPTIAN, FRENCH,  AND TURKISH --  IS REMARKABLY SIMILAR.  IT GOES AS FOLLOWS: BAATH REGIME HAS TRIED AND FAILED TO CRUSH KURDISH MOVEMENT.  IT DOES NOT WANT A RENEWAL OF WIDESCALE FIGHTING.  IT HAS RECOGNIZED IT HAS NO CHOICE BUT TO GIVE KURDS CERTAIN RIGHTS AND SEMI- AUTONOMY.  OFFER FALLS SHORT OF WHAT KURDS WANT,  BUT IT GOES WELL BEYOND WHAT ANY PREVIOUS BAGHDAD GOVERNMENT OFFERED KURDS.  FURTHERMORE,  NO SOVEREIGHN GOVERNMENT COULD OFFER MUCH MORE WITHOUT GRANTING INDEPENDENCE.  KURDISH RESISTANCE TO COMPROMISE WITH BAATH WOULD END IF IRAN STOPPED ITS ASSISTANCE.  DETENTE WITH IRAN IS THUS NECESSARY TO CONSOLIDATE BAATH POWER.\n4.  I HOPE THAT IN RESPONDING TO SHAH S REQUEST FOR INFO ON RECENT SOVIET ACTIVITIES IN IRAQ,  DEPARTMENT WILL CITE EXTENT TO WHICH IRAQ NOW TURNING TO WEST FOR NEW ECONOMIC PROJECTS;  REVIVAL OF RELATIONS WITH CHINA;  AND IF POSSIBLE,  RECENT IRAQI REQUESTS TO UK AND SPAIN WHICH INDICATE INTEREST IN LESSENING SOVIET INFLUENCE EVEN IN MILITARY SPHERE.

IF WE ARE INTERESTED IN WORKING TOWARD IMPROVING RELATIONS WITH IRAQ,  I BELIEVE TIME HAS COME TO DISASSOCIATE OURSELVES FROM KURDISH REQUESTS FOR U. S.  MILITARY ASSISTANCE AND AVOID RECEIVING KURDISH ENVOYS,  EVEN FOR SYMPATHETIC HEARINGS.  SUCH A DECISION COULD ALSO CONTRIBUTE TO OUR BROADER INTEREST IN REGIONAL STABILITY.  THIS RECOMMENDATION IS BASED ON FOLLOWING CONCLUSIONS:\n2.  BAATH REGIME,  HOWEVER DISTASTEFUL TO US AND MOST IRAQIS, IS ESSENTIALLY A NATIONALIST REGIME,  EXCEEDINGLY JEALOUS OF ITS SOVEREIGNITY.  IT HAS RECOGNIZED IT CANNOT DEFEAT KURDS MILITARILY AND IN MARCH 1970  ACCEPTED NECESSITY OF GRANTING KURDS CULTURAL AND OTHER RIGHTS.  THESE RIGHTS GO WELL BEYOND WHAT KURDS ENJOY     SECRET\n3.  AS LONG AS BARZANI RECEIVES ASSISTANCE FROM IRAN AND CAN  HOPE FOR U. S.  ASSISTANCE,  HE IS UNLIKELY TO COMPROMISE WITH BAATH.  THUS PROSPECT OF RENEWED FIGHTING AND DIVERSION OF IRAQ FROM ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT REMAINS HIGH.  MILITARY OPERATIONS AGAINST KURDS WOULD ALSO BE LIKELY TO STRENGTHEN RATHER THAN TO WEAKEN SOVIET INFLUENCE.  THERE IS ALSO POSSIBILITY THAT KURDISH INSURGENCY WILL SPREAD INTO TURKEY,  AND EVENTUALLY TO IRAN.  I DO NOT KNOW SERIOUSNESS WITH WHICH TURKISHGOVERNMENT VIEWS KURDISH PROBLEM,  BUT TURKISH AMBASSADOR CUHRUK IS INTENSELY INTERESTED IN ALL ASPECTS OF SUBJECT AND RECENT 5  DAY VISIT OF TURKISH INTERIOR MINSTER IS BELIEVED TO HAVE BEEN PARTLY MOTIVATED BY CONCERN OVER KURDS.\n4.  FOR BETTER OR WORSE,  IT IS HARD TO ESCAPE CONCLUSION THAT FUTURE OF IRAQI KURDS LIES WITH THEIR INTEGRATION INTO IRAQI STATE, ALBEIT WITH AS MUCH AUTONOMY AS THEY CAN OBTAIN.  ONLY IF IRAQI KURDS WERE TO RECEIVE MASSIVE OUTSIDE ASSISTANCE WOULD THEY BE ABLE TO ACHIEVE REAL AUTONOMY .  SUCH ASSISTANCE IS UNLIKELY TO BE FORTHCOMING EVEN FROM IRAN.  FURTHERMORE,  IN TERMS OF REGIONAL STABILITY,  IT IS PROBABLY PREFERABLE THAT KURDISH INDEPENDENCE MOVEMENT DOES NOT SUCCEED.\n5.  IRANIAN AND ISRAELI ASSISTANCE TO KURDS HAS SERVED THEIR PURPOSES,  BUT THERE IS LITTLE TO SUGGEST IT HAS SERVED INTERESTS OF KURDISH PEOPLE,  EXCEPT BY KEEPING ALIVE ILLUSION OF EVENTUAL INDEPENDENCE AND WINNING CONCESSIONS FROM BAATH REGIME.  SINCE CESSATION OF FIGHTING IN MARCH 1970,  HOWEVER,  KURDISTAN HAS, ACCORDING TO SCANTY INFO AVAILABLE HERE,  REMAINED A DEPRESSED AREA. IT HAS NOT SHARED IN ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND REMAINS SOMETHING LIKE A STATE UNDER SIEGE.  A RECENT SURVEY BY ENGLISH ILO EXPERT, INDICATES THAT INCOME OF KURDISH ARTISANS MAY BE AS MUCH AS 40  PERCENT BELOW ARTISANS IN REST OF COUNTRY.\n6.  KURDISH PROBLEM IS OF COURSE INEXTRICABLY LINKED WITH IRAN S POLICY TOWARD IRAQ.  THERE CAN BE NO RESOLUTION OF PROBLEM IN IRAQ OR LASTING DETENTE BETWEEN IRAQ AND IRAN WITHOUT CESSATION OF     SECRET\n",840675

SUMMARY: EVENTS OF PAST WEEK APPEAR TO JUSTIFY CONCLUSION THAT POSITION OF BAKR AND SADDAM HUSSEIN IS STRONGER, BUT BAATH PARTY WEAKENED. PURGE UNDERWAY WITHIN PARTY AND PROBABLY SECURITY FORCES. ARMY APPARENTLY UNDER CONTROL. REGIME CONTINUING TO PURSUE HIGHLY NATIONALIST POLICIES AND INDICATES DESIRE FOR IMPROVED RELATIONS WITH WEST, PERHAPS EVEN U.S. END SUMMARY\n2. SENTENCING OF ABDUL-KHALIQ AL-SAMMARIE TO LIFE IMPRISONMENT AND EXECUTION OF MOHAMMED FADHEL, MEMBER OF REGIONAL LEADERSHIP CONFIDENTIAL RESPONSIBLE FOR PARTY CONTROL OVER ARMY, SEEM TO HAVE RESULTED IN UNCHALLENGED LEADERSHIP OF BAKR/SADDAM COMBINATION. MOHAMMED FADHEL NOT BELIEVED TO HAVE HAD PERSONAL FOLLOWING. SAMMARIE, HOWEVER, HAD FOLLOWING THROUGHOUT BAATH. HE DROVE OWN CAR, DRESSED SIMPLY, WAS CRITICAL OF BAATHISTS WHO WORE LONDON TAILORED SUITS (I.E. SADDAM) AND CONDEMNED THOSE WHO DEVIATED FROM PURE BAATHISM AS INTERPRETED BY HIMSELF. REAL EXTENT OF SAMMARIES INVOLVEMENT IN PLOT WILL PROBABLY NEVER BE KNOWN. ACCORDING TO ALGERIAN AMBASSADOR, ""HUNDREDS OF ARRESTS"" HAVE TAKEN PLACE AMONG PARTY MEMBERS CONNECTED WITH SAMMARIE. SHAKE UP IN SECURITY FORCES RESULTING IN ARRESTS, DISMISSALS, AND TRANSFERS. NO OTHER LEADERS YET DISCREDITED. LABOR LEADER MOHAMAD AYESH INTERROGATED, THEN RELEASED.\n3. STATEMENT IN OFFICIAL RELEASE THAT PLOT BEGAN SIX MONTHS AGO PLACES IT IN CRUCIAL STAGE OF IPC NEGOTIATIONS. FRENCH AMBASSADOR BELIEVES THAT SAMMARIES OPEN OPPOSITION TO SADDAM DATES FROM THIS TIME. NEGOTIATORS HAD REACHED HIGHLY FAVORABLE AGREEMENT JUST PRIOR TO CHRISTMAS AND THEN GOI HAD INEXPLICABLY BACKED OFF. FRENCH AMBASSADOR HAD GONE TO SEE SADDAM AND THIS WAS ONLY MEETING HE HAD HAD IN WHICH SADDAM WAS UNSURE OF HIMSELF. SADDAM HAD SAID HE COULD NOT TAKE DECISION SINCE BAATH RULE WAS COLLEGIAL. SAMMARIE WAS SINGLED OUT AT THIS TIME AS ONLY BAATH LEADER WHO PUBLICLY OPPOSED PARTICIPATION AND AS PROBABLE LEADER OF ""LEFTIST"" ELEMENTS (BAGHDAD 0002 OF JAN 1).\n4. SINCE COUP ATTEMPT REGIME HAS PURSUED STRONGLY NATIONALIST POLICIES OF RECENT MONTHS AND TAKEN OTHER MEASURES WHICH SEEM TO DEMONSTRATE THAT BAKR AND SADDAM IN FULL CONTROL. ALL RES- TRICTIONS ON FOREIGN TRAVEL, WITH EXCEPTION OF IRAN, WERE REMOVED ON JULY 10. ON JULY 11 SADDAM RECEIVED CORRESPONDENTS OF NEW YORK TIMES, LE MONDE AND LONDON OBSERVER FOR OVER FOUR HOURS. HE INDICATED DESIRE FOR EARLY RAPPROCHEMENT WITH UK AND TO LESSER EXTENT WITH U.S. HE STRESSED THAT REGIME WOULD DEMOCRATIZE ITSELF TO ENSURE GREATER PARTICIPATION. AT END OF INTERVIEW, HE SPENT HOUR ASKING JOURNALISTS QUESTIONS ON SUCH TOPICS AS IRAQS IMAGE IN WEST. ON JULY 11 GOI SIGNED 20 MILLION DOLLAR CONTRACT WITH JAPANESE FIRM FOR CONSTRUCTION OF MICROWAVE NETWORK. PURCHASE OF EIGHT NEW A/C ANNOUNCED JULY 10 WHICH PRESUMABLY INCLUDING FIVE FOEINGS VALUED AT 55 MILLION DOLLARS. VICE PRESIDENT OF INTER- CONTINENTAL HOTELS SPENT JULY 12-14 HERE AT INVITATION OF MINISTRY CONFIDENTIAL OF PLANNING, WHICH WANTS INTER-CONTINENTAL TO BUILD HOTEL IN BASRA.\n5. ON JULY 8 MININT LTGEN SAADOUN GHAIDAN SENT CONFIDENTIAL MESSAGE TO BRITISH HOME SECRETARY REQUESTING THAT HE RECEIVE MEDICAL CARE IN UK FOR PARTIALLY PARALYZED ARM RESULTING FROM TWO BULLET WOUNDS HE RECEIVED DURING COUP ATTEMPT. BRITISH AGREED AND GHAIDAN WILL LEAVE FOR UK THIS WEEK WITH ENTOURAGE. IN ADDITION, WIFE AND CHILDREN OF PRESIDENT AL-BAKR ARE GOING TO UK ON HOLIDAY, AND TWO SONS OF LATE MINDEF SHEHAB HAVE ALREADY RETURNED TO STUDIES THERE. DIRGEN OF RCC ABDUL JALIL ALSO VISITING UK.\n6. ALTHOUGH RELATIONS WITH COMMUNIST STATES REMAIN CORRECT, COMMUNIST DIPLOMATS HAVE SHOWN SOME CONSTERNATION OVER DISAPPEARANCE OF SAMMARIE. COMMUNIST REPRESENTATION AT JULY 14-17 CELEBRATIONS SEEMS LOW LEVEL AND THEY ARE RECEIVING LITTLE ATTENTION IN PRESS. SOVIET REP EXPECTED TO BE R. RASHIDOV, CANDIDATE MEMBER OF POLITBURO FROM UZBEKISTAN, BUT AS OF JULY 15 NO DEL FROM USSR HAD APPEARED.\n7. COMMENT: IF ABOVE TRENDS CONTINUE IT WILL BE IMPORTANT THAT WESTERN COUNTRIES TAKE ACTIONS TO SHOW THAT SUCH POLICIES ARE IN IRAQS BEST INTERESTS. FOR EXAMPLE, ALGERIAN AMBASSADOR BELIEVES THAT WHEN SUBSTANCE OF INTERVIEWS WITH WESTERN JOURNALISTS GETS BACK TO IRAQ SADDAM IS GOING TO BE BRANDED A ""RIGHTEST"". THUS HE WILL NEED SOME SUCCESSES TO STRENGTHEN HIS POSITION. DETENTE WITH IRAN, WHICH WOULD GIVE REGIME GREATER SENSE OF SECURITY AND MIGHT ENABLE IT TO RESOLVE KURDISH PROBLEM, IS OF PRIMORDIAL IMPORTANCE. IT MAY EVEN BE PREREQUISITE TO RAPPROCHEMENT WITH WEST SINCE IN ABSENCE OF DETENTE WITH IRAN, IT WOULD BE DIFFICULT FOR REGIME TO ANTAGONIZE FURTHER SOVIET UNION, WHICH IS STILL ITS MAJOR PROTECTOR AGAINST EXTERNAL THREAT.

SUMMARY.  JULY 15 EDITIONS OF NEW YORK TIMES AND WASHINGTON POST REPORTED EXCLUSIVE INTERVIEW WITH IRAQI REVOLUTIONARY COMMAND COUNCIL (RCC) VICE PRESIDENT SADDAM HUSSEIN.  IN JULY 13 INTERVIEW HUSSEIN INDICATED DESIRE TO LIMITED OFFICIAL USE\n2.  IN JULY 13 INTERVIEW WITH WESTERN JOURNALISTS IN BAGHDAD RCC VICE PRESIDENT SADDAM HUSSEIN AL TAKRITI INDICATED THAT IRAQ DOES NOT WANT ALIGNMENT WITH EAST OR WEST BUT HOPES TO ""BE NEUTRAL BETWEEN INTERNATIONAL CONFLICTS.""  AL- THOUGH HUSSEIN VIEWS CURRENT US AND UK POLICY AS HOSTILE, HE SAID ""IRAQ WOULD WELCOME MOVES BY THE U.S. AND BRITAIN THAT COULD LEAD TO NORMALIZATION OF RELATIONS.""  HUSSEIN WAS MORE OPTIMISTIC CONCERNING THE POSSIBLE IMPROVEMENT OF RELATIONS WITH THE UK THAN WITH THE U.S. BECAUSE ""BRITAINS STANCE IN THE MIDDLE EAST CAN BE FAR LESS RIGID"" AND ""THE U.S. IS SEEN AS DEEPLY AND UNALTERABLY PRO-ISRAEL"" (WASHINGTON POST).  THERE WAS NO SUGGESTION DURING THE INTERVIEW THAT IRAQ WANTS TO DEPRIVE THE WEST OF ITS OIL RESOURCES.  HUSSEIN TOLD NEWSMEN THAT ""IRAQ CANNOT DRINK OIL, AND OUR MARKETS ARE THE WEST AND JAPAN.""  HUSSEIN PLAYED DOWN THE IMPORTANCE OF IRAQS RELATIONSHIP WITH THE SOVIET UNION WHICH THE WASHINGTON-POST STATED IS ""ECONOMICALLY PRACTICAL AND POLITICALLY LIMITED.""\n2.  NEW YORK TIMES ARTICLE REPORTS HUSSEIN AS SAYING ""THE SECURITY OF AMERICAN OIL SUPPLIES FROM THE MIDDLE EAST WOULD BE BETTER SERVED BY DEVELOPING FRIENDLY RELA- TIONS WITH ARAB PRODUCERS THAN BY ARMING ISRAEL AND IRAN."" BOTH THE TIMES AND POST ARTICLES EMPHASIZED HUSSEINS CONCERN OVER IRANS LARGE PURCHASES OF AMERICAN AND BRITISH MILITARY EQUIPMENT AND OVER IRANS SEIZURE OF THREE ISLANDS AT THE MOUTH OF THE GULF (ABU MUSA, GREATER AND LESSER TUNB).  HUSSEIN SAID IRAN MUST WITHDRAW FROM THE ISLANDS OR NEGOTIATE A PEACEFUL SETTLEMENT WITH THE ARAB EMIRATES ON THE FUTURE OF THE ISLANDS.  HE INFORMED NEWSMEN THAT RECENT CONTACTS WITH IRAN HAD PRODUCED ""NO POSITIVE RESULTS"" AND ""THERE IS NO REASON TO BELIEVE IN IRANS PEACEFUL INTENTIONS.""  THE N.Y. TIMES REPORTED HIM AS SAYING, HOWEVER, THAT THERE WERE ""STILL MANY LIMITED OFFICIAL USE\n3.  HUSSEIN TALKED OF THE CREATION OF A NATIONAL PARLIA- MENT TO ACHIEVE ""A HEALTHY CONSENSUS.""  HE ANNOUNCED A NEW AGREEMENT WITH THE IRAQI COMMUNIST PARTY.  THE REVO- LUTIONARY COMMAND COUNCIL IS TO REMAIN THE SUPREME AUTHOR- ITY IN IRAQ, AND EXCLUSIVELY BAATHIST, BUT IT WILL BE EN- LARGED.\n4.  HUSSEIN ALSO FORECAST KURDISH PROGRESS TO AUTONOMY BY NEXT MARCH.

            to our broader interest in regional stability This recommendation is based                        on following conclusions:2 Baath regime however distasteful to us and most Iraqis is essentially a                        nationalist regime exceedingly jealous of its sovereignty It has                        recognized it cannot defeat Kurds militarily and in March 1970 accepted                        necessity of granting Kurds cultural and other rights These rights go well                        beyond what Kurds enjoy in neighboring countries Neither Baath regime nor                        any other Iraqi regime is likely to agree to type of autonomy that Barzani                        demands since to do so would be tantamount to surrendering sovereignty3 As long as Barzani receives assistance from Iran and can hope for US                        assistance he is unlikely to compromise with Baath Thus prospect of                        renewed fighting and diversion of Iraq from economic development remains                        high Military operations against Kurds would also be likely to strengthen                        rather than to weaken Soviet influence There is also possibility that                        Kurdish insurgency will spread into Turkey and eventually to Iran I do not know seriousness with                        which Turkish Government views Kurdish problem but Turkish Ambassador                        Cuhruk is intensely interested in all aspects of subject and recent 5day                        visit of Turkish Interior Minister is believed to have been partly motivated                        by concern over Kurds4 For better or worse it is hard to escape conclusion that future of Iraqi                        Kurds lies with their integration into Iraqi state albeit with as much                        autonomy as they can obtain Only if Iraqi Kurds were to receive massive                        outside assistance would they be able to achieve real autonomy Such                        assistance is unlikely to be forthcoming even from Iran Furthermore in                        terms of regional stability it is probably preferable that Kurdish                        independence movement does not succeed5 Iranian and Israeli assistance to Kurds has served their purposes but                        there is little to suggest it has served interests of Kurdish people except                        by keeping alive illusion of eventual independence and winning concessions                        from Baath regime Since cessation of fighting in March 1970 however                        Kurdistan has according to scanty info available here remained a depressed                        area It has not shared in economic development and remains something like a                        state under siege A recent survey by English ILO expert indicates that income of Kurdish artisans may be as                        much as 40 percent below artisans in rest of country6 Kurdish problem is of course inextricably linked with Irans policy toward                        Iraq There can be no resolution of problem in Iraq or lasting dtente                        between Iraq and Iran without cessation of Iranian assistance to Kurds                        While recognizing overwhelming importance of Iranian policy I recommend                        that we make clear to all concerned parties what US policy is I believe                        US position should be that IraqiKurdish conflict is strictly Iraqi                        internal matter in which USG has no                        intention of becoming involved This position should be conveyed to                        Barzanis envoys whenever they attempt to elicit US assistance and also to                        Iraqi Government preferably through official noteLowrie,frus1969-76v27d220,"1.  IF WE ARE INTERESTED IN WORKING TOWARD IMPROVING RELATIONS WITH IRAQ,  I BELIEVE TIME HAS COME TO DISASSOCIATE OURSELVES FROM KURDISH REQUESTS FOR U. S.  MILITARY ASSISTANCE AND AVOID RECEIVING KURDISH ENVOYS,  EVEN FOR SYMPATHETIC HEARINGS.  SUCH A DECISION COULD ALSO CONTRIBUTE TO OUR BROADER INTEREST IN REGIONAL STABILITY.  THIS RECOMMENDATION IS BASED ON FOLLOWING CONCLUSIONS:\n2.  BAATH REGIME,  HOWEVER DISTASTEFUL TO US AND MOST IRAQIS, IS ESSENTIALLY A NATIONALIST REGIME,  EXCEEDINGLY JEALOUS OF ITS SOVEREIGNITY.  IT HAS RECOGNIZED IT CANNOT DEFEAT KURDS MILITARILY AND IN MARCH 1970  ACCEPTED NECESSITY OF GRANTING KURDS CULTURAL AND OTHER RIGHTS.  THESE RIGHTS GO WELL BEYOND WHAT KURDS ENJOY     SECRET\n3.  AS LONG AS BARZANI RECEIVES ASSISTANCE FROM IRAN AND CAN  HOPE FOR U. S.  ASSISTANCE,  HE IS UNLIKELY TO COMPROMISE WITH BAATH.  THUS PROSPECT OF RENEWED FIGHTING AND DIVERSION OF IRAQ FROM ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT REMAINS HIGH.  MILITARY OPERATIONS AGAINST KURDS WOULD ALSO BE LIKELY TO STRENGTHEN RATHER THAN TO WEAKEN SOVIET INFLUENCE.  THERE IS ALSO POSSIBILITY THAT KURDISH INSURGENCY WILL SPREAD INTO TURKEY,  AND EVENTUALLY TO IRAN.  I DO NOT KNOW SERIOUSNESS WITH WHICH TURKISHGOVERNMENT VIEWS KURDISH PROBLEM,  BUT TURKISH AMBASSADOR CUHRUK IS INTENSELY INTERESTED IN ALL ASPECTS OF SUBJECT AND RECENT 5  DAY VISIT OF TURKISH INTERIOR MINSTER IS BELIEVED TO HAVE BEEN PARTLY MOTIVATED BY CONCERN OVER KURDS.\n4.  FOR BETTER OR WORSE,  IT IS HARD TO ESCAPE CONCLUSION THAT FUTURE OF IRAQI KURDS LIES WITH THEIR INTEGRATION INTO IRAQI STATE, ALBEIT WITH AS MUCH AUTONOMY AS THEY CAN OBTAIN.  ONLY IF IRAQI KURDS WERE TO RECEIVE MASSIVE OUTSIDE ASSISTANCE WOULD THEY BE ABLE TO ACHIEVE REAL AUTONOMY .  SUCH ASSISTANCE IS UNLIKELY TO BE FORTHCOMING EVEN FROM IRAN.  FURTHERMORE,  IN TERMS OF REGIONAL STABILITY,  IT IS PROBABLY PREFERABLE THAT KURDISH INDEPENDENCE MOVEMENT DOES NOT SUCCEED.\n5.  IRANIAN AND ISRAELI ASSISTANCE TO KURDS HAS SERVED THEIR PURPOSES,  BUT THERE IS LITTLE TO SUGGEST IT HAS SERVED INTERESTS OF KURDISH PEOPLE,  EXCEPT BY KEEPING ALIVE ILLUSION OF EVENTUAL INDEPENDENCE AND WINNING CONCESSIONS FROM BAATH REGIME.  SINCE CESSATION OF FIGHTING IN MARCH 1970,  HOWEVER,  KURDISTAN HAS, ACCORDING TO SCANTY INFO AVAILABLE HERE,  REMAINED A DEPRESSED AREA. IT HAS NOT SHARED IN ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND REMAINS SOMETHING LIKE A STATE UNDER SIEGE.  A RECENT SURVEY BY ENGLISH ILO EXPERT, INDICATES THAT INCOME OF KURDISH ARTISANS MAY BE AS MUCH AS 40  PERCENT BELOW ARTISANS IN REST OF COUNTRY.\n6.  KURDISH PROBLEM IS OF COURSE INEXTRICABLY LINKED WITH IRAN S POLICY TOWARD IRAQ.  THERE CAN BE NO RESOLUTION OF PROBLEM IN IRAQ OR LASTING DETENTE BETWEEN IRAQ AND IRAN WITHOUT CESSATION OF     SECRET\n",840675

FOLLOWING ARE UNINT S COMMENTS ON ITEMS LISTED IN PARA ONE OF REFTEL. ( A)  ONLY AGREEMENT WE ARE AWARE OF RE MINISTRY OF  INTERIOR WAS CONCLUDED WITH TT AASLOVAKIA IN DECEMBER 1972 ( BAGHDAD 81).  AS MENTIONED AT TIME,  IT WAS BELIEVED IRAQIS WANTED TO PROFIT FROM COMMUNIST EXPERIENCE IN THIS AREA, PARTICULARLY TECHNICAL SECURITY ITEMS. ( B)  USINT NOT AWARE OF SPECIFIC TRADE UNION CONFERENCE,  BUT IRAQI TRADE UNIONS LIKE ALL OTHER PUBLIC ORGANIZATIONS,  INCLUDING COMMUNIST PARTY, ARE EITHER DIRECTLY CONTROLLED BY BAATH OR CLOSELY WATCHED BY THEM. ( C) 1,000  FIGURE FOR SOVIET TECHNICIANS IS AS GOOD A GUESS AS ANY. ( D)  COMMUNISTS HAVE IN EFFECT ACCEPTED BAATH DOMINATED NATIONAL FRONT FOR OVER A YEAR AND THEY HAVE TWO FIGUREHEAD MINISTERS IN CABINET.  ADDITIONAL AGREEMENT MAY HAVE BEEN REACHED,  BUT THIS DOES NOT NECESSARILY MEAN BAATH IS GOING TO PERMIT ICP ANY MORE FREEDOM OF ACTION. ( E)  ITALIANS AND FRENCH BOTH HAVE HEARD REPORT THAT IRAQ WILL RECEIVE UP TO ONE SQUADRON OF TU-22  OR SOME TYPE SOVIET BOMBER.  FACT     SECRET\n2.  COMMENT:  THERE IS SOMETHING OF SELF- FULFILLING PROPHECY TO SHAH S ANALYSIS THAT IRAQ COULD BECOME SOVIET SATELITE.  IF IRAN RESISTS IRAQI OVERTURES FOR DETENTE, CONTINUES TO GIVE\n3.  ANALYSIS OF BEST INFORMED AMBASSADORS --  ALGERIAN,  EGYPTIAN, FRENCH,  AND TURKISH --  IS REMARKABLY SIMILAR.  IT GOES AS FOLLOWS: BAATH REGIME HAS TRIED AND FAILED TO CRUSH KURDISH MOVEMENT.  IT DOES NOT WANT A RENEWAL OF WIDESCALE FIGHTING.  IT HAS RECOGNIZED IT HAS NO CHOICE BUT TO GIVE KURDS CERTAIN RIGHTS AND SEMI- AUTONOMY.  OFFER FALLS SHORT OF WHAT KURDS WANT,  BUT IT GOES WELL BEYOND WHAT ANY PREVIOUS BAGHDAD GOVERNMENT OFFERED KURDS.  FURTHERMORE,  NO SOVEREIGHN GOVERNMENT COULD OFFER MUCH MORE WITHOUT GRANTING INDEPENDENCE.  KURDISH RESISTANCE TO COMPROMISE WITH BAATH WOULD END IF IRAN STOPPED ITS ASSISTANCE.  DETENTE WITH IRAN IS THUS NECESSARY TO CONSOLIDATE BAATH POWER.\n4.  I HOPE THAT IN RESPONDING TO SHAH S REQUEST FOR INFO ON RECENT SOVIET ACTIVITIES IN IRAQ,  DEPARTMENT WILL CITE EXTENT TO WHICH IRAQ NOW TURNING TO WEST FOR NEW ECONOMIC PROJECTS;  REVIVAL OF RELATIONS WITH CHINA;  AND IF POSSIBLE,  RECENT IRAQI REQUESTS TO UK AND SPAIN WHICH INDICATE INTEREST IN LESSENING SOVIET INFLUENCE EVEN IN MILITARY SPHERE.

FRENCH AMBASSADOR GAVE ME COPY OF PROPOSAL SUBMITTED BY KDP TO GOI IN EARLY MAY WHICH WE HAVE NOW TRANSLATED (FULL TEXT OF TRANSLATION BY AIRGRAM). MAJOR POINTS ARE:\n2. IRAQI REPUBLIC INDIVISIBLE, WITHIN WHICH KURDISH REGION ENJOYS AUTONOMY. KURDS TO OCCUPY PUBLIC POSITIONS, INCLUDING IMPORTANT AND SENSITIVE POSTS, IN CENTRAL GOVERNMENT IN PROPORTION TO PERCENTAGE OF POPULATION THEY REPRESENT. KURDS WILL OCCUPY PROPORTIONATE NUMBER OF SEATS IN NATIONAL ASSEMBLY AND A KURD CHOSEN BY REGIONAL ASSEMBLY SHALL BE VP.\n3. KURDISTAN WILL HAVE FREELY AND DIRECTLY ELECTED LEGISLATURE WHICH WILL MAKE REGIONAL LAWS, ASSESS LOCAL TAXES,APPROVE REGIONAL ECONOMIC PLAN, AND ELECT ITS OWN PRESIDENT WHO WILL ALSO BE VP OF NATIONAL LEGISLATURE. REGIONAL EXECUTIVE COUNCIL LIMITED OFFICIAL USE\n4. CENTRAL GOVERNMENT HAS JURISDICTION OVER ARMED FORCES, SECURITY, FOREIGN AFFAIRS, NATIONAL LEGISLATION, ECONOMIC PLANS, EXPLOITA- TION OF OIL RESOURCES, AND BUDGET, TAKING INTO ACCOUNT REGIONAL PREROGATIVES. ANY LEGISLATION PERTAINING TO AUTONOMY SHALL BE APPROVED BY REGIONAL EXECUTIVE COUNCIL BEFORE IT GOES INTO EFFECT. CONSITUTIONAL COURT WILL BE ESTABLISHED WITH HALF OF MEMBERS APPOINTED BY REGIONAL AND HALF BY CENTRAL GOVT. DISPUTES OVER CONSTITUTIONALITY AND LEGALITY OF LAWS AND REGULATIONS SHALL BE REFERRED TO THIS COURT AND ITS DECISIONS WILL BE BINDING ON ALL.\n5. COMMENT: GOI REACTION TO THIS KDP PROPOSAL IS NOT KNOWN, BUT TENSION HAS RISEN SINCE IT PUT FORWARD. IN SOME RESPECTS DOCUMENT REITERATES POINTS MADE IN MARCH 1970 MANIFESTO BUT IN MOST INSTANCES IT GOES BEYOND MANIFESTO OR BREAKS NEW GROUND (E.G. SAFEGUARD OF CONSTITUTIONAL COURT). IT MAKES PRACTICALLY NO MENTION OF CULTURAL RIGHTS WHICH SUGGESTS GOI HAS IMPLEMENTED MOST OF 1970 COMMITTMENTS. EXCEPT FOR OMISSION OF ANY REFERENCE TO HOW TERRITORIAL LIMITS OFKURDISTAN WOULD BE DETERMINED, WHICH IS RELATED TO CENSUS, DOCUMENT APPEARS TO BE SERIOUS PROPOSAL FOR NEGOTIATIONS. IF SO, BARZANIS EXTREME REMARKS TO HOAGLAND MAY HAVE BEEN PART OF NEGOTIATING PROCESS AIMED AT PERSUADING GOI TO GRANT THESE NEW CONCESSIONS. LOWRIE\n",843082

essentially a                        nationalist regime exceedingly jealous of its sovereignty It has                        recognized it cannot defeat Kurds militarily and in March 1970 accepted                        necessity of granting Kurds cultural and other rights These rights go well                        beyond what Kurds enjoy in neighboring countries Neither Baath regime nor                        any other Iraqi regime is likely to agree to type of autonomy that Barzani                        demands since to do so would be tantamount to surrendering sovereignty3 As long as

SUMMARY.  JULY 15 EDITIONS OF NEW YORK TIMES AND WASHINGTON POST REPORTED EXCLUSIVE INTERVIEW WITH IRAQI REVOLUTIONARY COMMAND COUNCIL (RCC) VICE PRESIDENT SADDAM HUSSEIN.  IN JULY 13 INTERVIEW HUSSEIN INDICATED DESIRE TO LIMITED OFFICIAL USE\n2.  IN JULY 13 INTERVIEW WITH WESTERN JOURNALISTS IN BAGHDAD RCC VICE PRESIDENT SADDAM HUSSEIN AL TAKRITI INDICATED THAT IRAQ DOES NOT WANT ALIGNMENT WITH EAST OR WEST BUT HOPES TO ""BE NEUTRAL BETWEEN INTERNATIONAL CONFLICTS.""  AL- THOUGH HUSSEIN VIEWS CURRENT US AND UK POLICY AS HOSTILE, HE SAID ""IRAQ WOULD WELCOME MOVES BY THE U.S. AND BRITAIN THAT COULD LEAD TO NORMALIZATION OF RELATIONS.""  HUSSEIN WAS MORE OPTIMISTIC CONCERNING THE POSSIBLE IMPROVEMENT OF RELATIONS WITH THE UK THAN WITH THE U.S. BECAUSE ""BRITAINS STANCE IN THE MIDDLE EAST CAN BE FAR LESS RIGID"" AND ""THE U.S. IS SEEN AS DEEPLY AND UNALTERABLY PRO-ISRAEL"" (WASHINGTON POST).  THERE WAS NO SUGGESTION DURING THE INTERVIEW THAT IRAQ WANTS TO DEPRIVE THE WEST OF ITS OIL RESOURCES.  HUSSEIN TOLD NEWSMEN THAT ""IRAQ CANNOT DRINK OIL, AND OUR MARKETS ARE THE WEST AND JAPAN.""  HUSSEIN PLAYED DOWN THE IMPORTANCE OF IRAQS RELATIONSHIP WITH THE SOVIET UNION WHICH THE WASHINGTON-POST STATED IS ""ECONOMICALLY PRACTICAL AND POLITICALLY LIMITED.""\n2.  NEW YORK TIMES ARTICLE REPORTS HUSSEIN AS SAYING ""THE SECURITY OF AMERICAN OIL SUPPLIES FROM THE MIDDLE EAST WOULD BE BETTER SERVED BY DEVELOPING FRIENDLY RELA- TIONS WITH ARAB PRODUCERS THAN BY ARMING ISRAEL AND IRAN."" BOTH THE TIMES AND POST ARTICLES EMPHASIZED HUSSEINS CONCERN OVER IRANS LARGE PURCHASES OF AMERICAN AND BRITISH MILITARY EQUIPMENT AND OVER IRANS SEIZURE OF THREE ISLANDS AT THE MOUTH OF THE GULF (ABU MUSA, GREATER AND LESSER TUNB).  HUSSEIN SAID IRAN MUST WITHDRAW FROM THE ISLANDS OR NEGOTIATE A PEACEFUL SETTLEMENT WITH THE ARAB EMIRATES ON THE FUTURE OF THE ISLANDS.  HE INFORMED NEWSMEN THAT RECENT CONTACTS WITH IRAN HAD PRODUCED ""NO POSITIVE RESULTS"" AND ""THERE IS NO REASON TO BELIEVE IN IRANS PEACEFUL INTENTIONS.""  THE N.Y. TIMES REPORTED HIM AS SAYING, HOWEVER, THAT THERE WERE ""STILL MANY LIMITED OFFICIAL USE\n3.  HUSSEIN TALKED OF THE CREATION OF A NATIONAL PARLIA- MENT TO ACHIEVE ""A HEALTHY CONSENSUS.""  HE ANNOUNCED A NEW AGREEMENT WITH THE IRAQI COMMUNIST PARTY.  THE REVO- LUTIONARY COMMAND COUNCIL IS TO REMAIN THE SUPREME AUTHOR- ITY IN IRAQ, AND EXCLUSIVELY BAATHIST, BUT IT WILL BE EN- LARGED.\n4.  HUSSEIN ALSO FORECAST KURDISH PROGRESS TO AUTONOMY BY NEXT MARCH.  THE WASHINGTON POST REPORTS KURDS BLAMED NAZIM KAZZAR, WHO WAS ""WIDELY CONSIDERED TO HAVE BEEN A VIRTUAL PSYCHOPATH,"" FOR INCIDENTS BETWEEN THE KURDS AND IRAQI SECURITY FORCES.  THE POST ARTICLE GAVE THE IMPRES- SION THAT NOW THAT KAZZAR HAS BEEN ELIMINATED RELATIONS BETWEEN THE KURDS AND THE BAATH PARTY MAY IMPROVE.  RUSH\n",847392

RADIO BAGHDAD ANNOUNCED AT 2000 HOURS JULY 1 THAT COUP ATTEMPT BY DIRECTOR OF NATIONAL SECURITY NAZIM KZAR ON JUNE 30 HAD FAILED. STATEMENT SAID KZAR AND HIS UNKNOWN SUPPORTERS HAD INVITED MINISTER OF DEFENSE, LT GENERAL HAMMAD SHEHAB, AND MINISTER OF INTERIOR LT GENERAL SAADOUN GHAIDAN AND OTHERS TO LUNCH ON JUNE 30 WITH INTENT TO IMPRISON THEM AND THEN SEIZE CONTROL. PLAN MISFIRED AND KZAR AND SUPPORTERS FLED TOWARD IRANIAN BORDER TAKING TWO MINISTERS WITH THEM. THEY WERE CAUGHT, BUT NOT BEFORE THEY KILLED SHEHAB AND SLIGHTLY WOUNDED GHAIDAN. RADIO AND TV READING FROM KORAN AND SHEHAB FUNERAL SET FOR 0800 JULY 2. AS OF CONFIDENTIAL 2300 HOURS JULY 1 CITY APPEARS NORMAL EXCEPT FOR HEAVY SECURITY GUARDS AROUND STRATEGIC POINTS, MANY OF THEM PARTY MILITIA.\n2. RUMORS OF COUP BEGAN CIRCULATING EARLY MORNING OF JULY 1 FOLLOWING REPORTS OF SHOOTING DURING NIGHT. CHIEFS OF MISSION, WHO WERE AT AIRPORT FOR DEPARTURE OF DUTCH AMBASSADOR, TIED SHOOTING IN WITH FACT THAT PRESIDENT AL-BAKRS PLANE WAS UN- ACCOUNTABLY TWO HOURS LATE, ARRIVING AT 2000 JUNE 30, ON RETURN FROM STATE VISITS TO BULGARIA AND POLAND. AIRPORT RECEPTION WAS UNUSUALLY MODEST AND NEITHER SHEHAB NOR GHAIDAN WERE PRESENT.\n3. MANY RUMORS AND THEORIES NOW CIRCULATING SINCE FEW OBSERVERS GIVE CREDIBILITY TO GOI STATEMENTS. PAKISTANI CHARGE TOLD ME THAT PRESIDENTS PLANE HAD BEEN TOLD TO DELAY LANDING UNTIL ALL WAS SAFE AND THAT AF PLANE WAS IN AIR TO SHOOT PLANE DOWN, BUT WHEN PILOT LEARNED THAT PLOT DISCOVERED, HE FLED ACROSS BORDER. THERE IS ALSO RUMOR THAT SEVERAL HUNDRED ARMY PERSONNEL AND BAATH MILITIA WERE KILLED IN CLASHES ON JULY 1 WHEN MILITIA WENT TO TAKE CONTROL OF CAMP RASHID, LARGEST MILITARY INSTALLATION NEAR BAGHDAD. CLOSEST THING TO CONFIRMATION OF THIS IS RELIABLE REPORT FROM BRITISH NURSE AT LOCAL HOSPITAL THAT AT ABOUT 1300 JULY 1 LOUDSPEAKER CALLED FOR ALL PERSONNEL TO STAY ON DUTY AND ALL AVAILABLE DOCTORS AND NURSES WERE SENT TO RASHID MILITARY HOSPITAL.\n4.

RADIO BAGHDAD ANNOUNCED AT 2000 HOURS JULY 1 THAT COUP ATTEMPT BY DIRECTOR OF NATIONAL SECURITY NAZIM KZAR ON JUNE 30 HAD FAILED. STATEMENT SAID KZAR AND HIS UNKNOWN SUPPORTERS HAD INVITED MINISTER OF DEFENSE, LT GENERAL HAMMAD SHEHAB, AND MINISTER OF INTERIOR LT GENERAL SAADOUN GHAIDAN AND OTHERS TO LUNCH ON JUNE 30 WITH INTENT TO IMPRISON THEM AND THEN SEIZE CONTROL. PLAN MISFIRED AND KZAR AND SUPPORTERS FLED TOWARD IRANIAN BORDER TAKING TWO MINISTERS WITH THEM. THEY WERE CAUGHT, BUT NOT BEFORE THEY KILLED SHEHAB AND SLIGHTLY WOUNDED GHAIDAN.

RUMORS OF COUP BEGAN CIRCULATING EARLY MORNING OF JULY 1 FOLLOWING REPORTS OF SHOOTING DURING NIGHT. CHIEFS OF MISSION, WHO WERE AT AIRPORT FOR DEPARTURE OF DUTCH AMBASSADOR, TIED SHOOTING IN WITH FACT THAT PRESIDENT AL-BAKRS PLANE WAS UN- ACCOUNTABLY TWO HOURS LATE, ARRIVING AT 2000 JUNE 30, ON RETURN FROM STATE VISITS TO BULGARIA AND POLAND. AIRPORT RECEPTION WAS UNUSUALLY MODEST AND NEITHER SHEHAB NOR GHAIDAN WERE PRESENT.\n3. MANY RUMORS AND THEORIES NOW CIRCULATING SINCE FEW OBSERVERS GIVE CREDIBILITY TO GOI STATEMENTS. PAKISTANI CHARGE TOLD ME THAT PRESIDENTS PLANE HAD BEEN TOLD TO DELAY LANDING UNTIL ALL WAS SAFE AND THAT AF PLANE WAS IN AIR TO SHOOT PLANE DOWN, BUT WHEN PILOT LEARNED THAT PLOT DISCOVERED, HE FLED ACROSS BORDER. THERE IS ALSO RUMOR THAT SEVERAL HUNDRED ARMY PERSONNEL AND BAATH MILITIA WERE KILLED IN CLASHES ON JULY 1 WHEN MILITIA WENT TO TAKE CONTROL OF CAMP RASHID, LARGEST MILITARY INSTALLATION NEAR BAGHDAD. CLOSEST THING TO CONFIRMATION OF THIS IS RELIABLE REPORT FROM BRITISH NURSE AT LOCAL HOSPITAL THAT AT ABOUT 1300 JULY 1 LOUDSPEAKER CALLED FOR ALL PERSONNEL TO STAY ON DUTY AND ALL AVAILABLE DOCTORS AND NURSES WERE SENT TO RASHID MILITARY HOSPITAL.\n4.

SUMMARY: EVENTS OF PAST WEEK APPEAR TO JUSTIFY CONCLUSION THAT POSITION OF BAKR AND SADDAM HUSSEIN IS STRONGER, BUT BAATH PARTY WEAKENED. PURGE UNDERWAY WITHIN PARTY AND PROBABLY SECURITY FORCES. ARMY APPARENTLY UNDER CONTROL. REGIME CONTINUING TO PURSUE HIGHLY NATIONALIST POLICIES AND INDICATES DESIRE FOR IMPROVED RELATIONS WITH WEST, PERHAPS EVEN U.S. END SUMMARY\n2. SENTENCING OF ABDUL-KHALIQ AL-SAMMARIE TO LIFE IMPRISONMENT AND EXECUTION OF MOHAMMED FADHEL, MEMBER OF REGIONAL LEADERSHIP CONFIDENTIAL RESPONSIBLE FOR PARTY CONTROL OVER ARMY, SEEM TO HAVE RESULTED IN UNCHALLENGED LEADERSHIP OF BAKR/SADDAM COMBINATION. MOHAMMED FADHEL NOT BELIEVED TO HAVE HAD PERSONAL FOLLOWING. SAMMARIE, HOWEVER, HAD FOLLOWING THROUGHOUT BAATH. HE DROVE OWN CAR, DRESSED SIMPLY, WAS CRITICAL OF BAATHISTS WHO WORE LONDON TAILORED SUITS (I.E. SADDAM) AND CONDEMNED THOSE WHO DEVIATED FROM PURE BAATHISM AS INTERPRETED BY HIMSELF. REAL EXTENT OF SAMMARIES INVOLVEMENT IN PLOT WILL PROBABLY NEVER BE KNOWN. ACCORDING TO ALGERIAN AMBASSADOR, ""HUNDREDS OF ARRESTS"" HAVE TAKEN PLACE AMONG PARTY MEMBERS CONNECTED WITH SAMMARIE. SHAKE UP IN SECURITY FORCES RESULTING IN ARRESTS, DISMISSALS, AND TRANSFERS. NO OTHER LEADERS YET DISCREDITED. LABOR LEADER MOHAMAD AYESH INTERROGATED, THEN RELEASED.\n3. STATEMENT IN OFFICIAL RELEASE THAT PLOT BEGAN SIX MONTHS AGO PLACES IT IN CRUCIAL STAGE OF IPC NEGOTIATIONS. FRENCH AMBASSADOR BELIEVES THAT SAMMARIES OPEN OPPOSITION TO SADDAM DATES FROM THIS TIME. NEGOTIATORS HAD REACHED HIGHLY FAVORABLE AGREEMENT JUST PRIOR TO CHRISTMAS AND THEN GOI HAD INEXPLICABLY BACKED OFF. FRENCH AMBASSADOR HAD GONE TO SEE SADDAM AND THIS WAS ONLY MEETING HE HAD HAD IN WHICH SADDAM WAS UNSURE OF HIMSELF. SADDAM HAD SAID HE COULD NOT TAKE DECISION SINCE BAATH RULE WAS COLLEGIAL. SAMMARIE WAS SINGLED OUT AT THIS TIME AS ONLY BAATH LEADER WHO PUBLICLY OPPOSED PARTICIPATION AND AS PROBABLE LEADER OF ""LEFTIST"" ELEMENTS (BAGHDAD 0002 OF JAN 1).\n4. SINCE COUP ATTEMPT REGIME HAS PURSUED STRONGLY NATIONALIST POLICIES OF RECENT MONTHS AND TAKEN OTHER MEASURES WHICH SEEM TO DEMONSTRATE THAT BAKR AND SADDAM IN FULL CONTROL. ALL RES- TRICTIONS ON FOREIGN TRAVEL, WITH EXCEPTION OF IRAN, WERE REMOVED ON JULY 10. ON JULY 11 SADDAM RECEIVED CORRESPONDENTS OF NEW YORK TIMES, LE MONDE AND LONDON OBSERVER FOR OVER FOUR HOURS. HE INDICATED DESIRE FOR EARLY RAPPROCHEMENT WITH UK AND TO LESSER EXTENT WITH U.S. HE STRESSED THAT REGIME WOULD DEMOCRATIZE ITSELF TO ENSURE GREATER PARTICIPATION. AT END OF INTERVIEW, HE SPENT HOUR ASKING JOURNALISTS QUESTIONS ON SUCH TOPICS AS IRAQS IMAGE IN WEST. ON JULY 11 GOI SIGNED 20 MILLION DOLLAR CONTRACT WITH JAPANESE FIRM FOR CONSTRUCTION OF MICROWAVE NETWORK. PURCHASE OF EIGHT NEW A/C ANNOUNCED JULY 10 WHICH PRESUMABLY INCLUDING FIVE FOEINGS VALUED AT 55 MILLION DOLLARS. VICE PRESIDENT OF INTER- CONTINENTAL HOTELS SPENT JULY 12-14 HERE AT INVITATION OF MINISTRY CONFIDENTIAL OF PLANNING, WHICH WANTS INTER-CONTINENTAL TO BUILD HOTEL IN BASRA.\n5. ON JULY 8 MININT LTGEN SAADOUN GHAIDAN SENT CONFIDENTIAL MESSAGE TO BRITISH HOME SECRETARY REQUESTING THAT HE RECEIVE MEDICAL CARE IN UK FOR PARTIALLY PARALYZED ARM RESULTING FROM TWO BULLET WOUNDS HE RECEIVED DURING COUP ATTEMPT. BRITISH AGREED AND GHAIDAN WILL LEAVE FOR UK THIS WEEK WITH ENTOURAGE. IN ADDITION, WIFE AND CHILDREN OF PRESIDENT AL-BAKR ARE GOING TO UK ON HOLIDAY, AND TWO SONS OF LATE MINDEF SHEHAB HAVE ALREADY RETURNED TO STUDIES THERE. DIRGEN OF RCC ABDUL JALIL ALSO VISITING UK.\n6. ALTHOUGH RELATIONS WITH COMMUNIST STATES REMAIN CORRECT, COMMUNIST DIPLOMATS HAVE SHOWN SOME CONSTERNATION OVER DISAPPEARANCE OF SAMMARIE. COMMUNIST REPRESENTATION AT JULY 14-17 CELEBRATIONS SEEMS LOW LEVEL AND THEY ARE RECEIVING LITTLE ATTENTION IN PRESS. SOVIET REP EXPECTED TO BE R. RASHIDOV, CANDIDATE MEMBER OF POLITBURO FROM UZBEKISTAN, BUT AS OF JULY 15 NO DEL FROM USSR HAD APPEARED.\n7. COMMENT: IF ABOVE TRENDS CONTINUE IT WILL BE IMPORTANT THAT WESTERN COUNTRIES TAKE ACTIONS TO SHOW THAT SUCH POLICIES ARE IN IRAQS BEST INTERESTS. FOR EXAMPLE, ALGERIAN AMBASSADOR BELIEVES THAT WHEN SUBSTANCE OF INTERVIEWS WITH WESTERN JOURNALISTS GETS BACK TO IRAQ SADDAM IS GOING TO BE BRANDED A ""RIGHTEST"". THUS HE WILL NEED SOME SUCCESSES TO STRENGTHEN HIS POSITION. DETENTE WITH IRAN, WHICH WOULD GIVE REGIME GREATER SENSE OF SECURITY AND MIGHT ENABLE IT TO RESOLVE KURDISH PROBLEM, IS OF PRIMORDIAL IMPORTANCE. IT MAY EVEN BE PREREQUISITE TO RAPPROCHEMENT WITH WEST SINCE IN ABSENCE OF DETENTE WITH IRAN, IT WOULD BE DIFFICULT FOR REGIME TO ANTAGONIZE FURTHER SOVIET UNION, WHICH IS STILL ITS MAJOR PROTECTOR AGAINST EXTERNAL THREAT.

SUMMARY: FIRST EXECUTIONS OCCURED JULY 7 AND MORE EXPECTED. NO FOREIGN INVOLVEMENT APPARENT. RUMORED ARRESTS OF HIGH PARTY OFFICIALS AND BEHAVIOR OF REGIME SUGGEST BITTER INTRA-BAATH GANG WARFARE TAKING PLACE WITH LITTLE IDEOLOGICAL MOTIVATION; WINNERS LIKELY TO INHERIT WEAKENED REGIME. ARMY ROLE STILL AN UNKNOWN. END SUMMARY\n2. ACCORDING TO OFFICIAL ANNOUNCEMENT, DG OF SECURITY NAZEM KZAR AND 22 LESSER SECURITY OFFICIALS EXECUTED AT NOON JULY 7 CONFIDENTIAL AFTER BEING TRIED IN SECRET BY SPECIAL COURT. ANNOUNCEMENT SAID THIS WAS ONLY ""FIRST BATCH."" LATE JULY 8 RADIO ANNOUNCED\n3. THERE ARE WIDESPREAD RUMORS THAT ARRESTS HAVE INCLUDED HIGH BAATH OFFICIALS, INCLUDING ABDUL KHALEQ AL-SAMMARRAI AND MOHAMMAD FADHEZU BOTH MEMBERS OF REGIONAL COMMAND; PRESIDENT\n5. RADIO REPORTS SAMMARRAI SENTENCED JULY 8 TO LIFE IMPRISONMENT.\n4. MOST OBSERVERS STILL PUZZLED OVER MEN AND MOTIVES INVOLVED. ONLY TWO ELEMENTS SEEM CLEAR: (A) NO FOREIGN POWER ALLEGED TO BE INVOLVED NOR IS THERE EVIDENCE OF FOREIGN INVOLVEMENT. THERE IS HOWEVER INDICATION THAT SOVIETS MAY WISH TO EXPLOIT NEW SITUATION BY INTER ALIA OBTAINING GREATER ROLE FOR ICP IN RETURN FOR RENEWAL OF SUPPORT. (BAGHDAD 0389). (B) POPULATION SEEMS UNINVOLVED. NEITHER SIDE HAS APPEALED TO THE ""STREET"" AND BAGHDAD HAS BEEN NORMAL THROUGHOIT CRISIS WITH EXCEPTION OF OCCASIONAL SIGHT OF ARMED MEN SURROUNDING A HOUSE AT NIGHT WITH GUNS AT READY. ATTITUDE OF AVERAGE IRAQI APPEARS TO BE THAT ONE FACTION OF BAATH NO BETTER THAN ANOTHER SO HE HAS NO STAKE IN OUTCOME.\n5. BEYOND THESE TWO GENERALIZATIONS, ALL ELSE IS SPECULATION. PRESIDENT BAKR CONTINUES TO APPEAR AS FIGUREHEAD BUT SOME, SUCH AS TURKISH AMBASSADOR, BELIEVE HE IS STILL FORCE TO RECKON WITH. MININTERIOR GHAIDAN REPORTED TO BE PARTLY PARALYZED AND GOING ABROAD FOR REST AND TREATMENT. SADDAM HUSSEIN IS ONLY LEADER WHO CONTINUES TO APPEAR ALMOST DAILY IN PUBLIC. HE HAS CLAIMED NO MILITARY INVOLVED, BUT REAL ROLE OF ARMY REMAIN UNKNOWN. ARMY CAN HARDLY BE PLEASED THAT NET RESULT THUS\n6. HYPOTHESIS THAT SEEMS MOST VALID AT THIS TIME IS THAT RIVALS OF SADDAM HUSSEIN ACTED BECAUSE THEY FEARED HIS GROWING POWER. DIFFERENCES, SUCH AS THOSE OVER KURDS, SUPPORT FOR FEDAYEEN, AND PRAGMATIC POLICY TOWARD WEST, PERHAPS USED AGAINST HIM, BUT CONFIDENTIAL REAL MOTIVE MORE LIKELY WAS NAKED BID FOR POWER. SADDAM HUSSEIN WAS ALERTED AND MOVED RUTHLESSLY WITH PARTY MILITIA TO CRUSH IT. TWO GENERALS PROBABLY CAUGHT IN MIDDLE. NAZEM KZAR AND OTHERS NO DOUBT TORTURED TO IMPLICATE OTHERS AND FURTHER PURGE OF PARTY SEEMS LIKELY. IF ARMY REMAINS ON SIDELINES, THERE APPEARS BE GOOD CHANCE SADDAM CAN CONSOLIDATE HIS POSITION. OVER LONG RUN, HOWEVER, REGIME IS WEAKENED. MANY NEW ENEMIES WILL BE WAITING FOR REVENGE AND, PSYCHOLOGICALLY, COUP HAS DEALT BLOW TO BAATH BY DEMONSTRATING THAT AFTER FIVE YEARS IN POWER, BAATH HAS CREATED NO VIABLE POLITICAL NSTITUTIONS AND THAT IT IS JUST ANOTHER POLICE STATE WITH SAME INHERENT WEAKNESSES AND INSTABILITYF OTHER SUCH STATES.\n7. IF PRESS MAKES QUERIES ON EXECUTIONS, I RECOMMEND DEPT REFRAIN FROM COMMENTING ON GROUNDS IT PURELY INTERNAL MATTER. NO REFERENCE SHOULD, IN ANY CASE, BE MADE TO USINT REPORTING. LOWRIE\n",843274

HE DROVE OWN CAR, DRESSED SIMPLY, WAS CRITICAL OF BAATHISTS WHO WORE LONDON TAILORED SUITS (I.E. SADDAM) AND CONDEMNED THOSE WHO DEVIATED FROM PURE BAATHISM AS INTERPRETED BY HIMSELF. REAL EXTENT OF SAMMARIES INVOLVEMENT IN PLOT WILL PROBABLY NEVER BE KNOWN. ACCORDING TO ALGERIAN AMBASSADOR, ""HUNDREDS OF ARRESTS"" HAVE TAKEN PLACE AMONG PARTY MEMBERS CONNECTED WITH SAMMARIE. SHAKE UP IN SECURITY FORCES RESULTING IN ARRESTS, DISMISSALS, AND TRANSFERS. NO OTHER LEADERS YET DISCREDITED. LABOR LEADER MOHAMAD AYESH INTERROGATED, THEN RELEASED.\n3. STATEMENT IN OFFICIAL RELEASE THAT PLOT BEGAN SIX MONTHS AGO PLACES IT IN CRUCIAL STAGE OF IPC NEGOTIATIONS. FRENCH AMBASSADOR BELIEVES THAT SAMMARIES OPEN OPPOSITION TO SADDAM DATES FROM THIS TIME.

FRENCH AMBASSADOR HAD GONE TO SEE SADDAM AND THIS WAS ONLY MEETING HE HAD HAD IN WHICH SADDAM WAS UNSURE OF HIMSELF. SADDAM HAD SAID HE COULD NOT TAKE DECISION SINCE BAATH RULE WAS COLLEGIAL. SAMMARIE WAS SINGLED OUT AT THIS TIME AS ONLY BAATH LEADER WHO PUBLICLY OPPOSED PARTICIPATION AND AS PROBABLE LEADER OF ""LEFTIST"" ELEMENTS (BAGHDAD 0002 OF JAN 1).\n4. SINCE COUP ATTEMPT REGIME HAS PURSUED STRONGLY NATIONALIST POLICIES OF RECENT MONTHS AND TAKEN OTHER MEASURES WHICH SEEM TO DEMONSTRATE THAT BAKR AND SADDAM IN FULL CONTROL. ALL RES- TRICTIONS ON FOREIGN TRAVEL, WITH EXCEPTION OF IRAN, WERE REMOVED ON JULY 10. ON JULY 11 SADDAM RECEIVED CORRESPONDENTS OF NEW YORK TIMES, LE MONDE AND LONDON OBSERVER FOR OVER FOUR HOURS. HE INDICATED DESIRE FOR EARLY RAPPROCHEMENT WITH UK AND TO LESSER EXTENT WITH U.S. HE STRESSED THAT REGIME WOULD DEMOCRATIZE ITSELF TO ENSURE GREATER PARTICIPATION. AT END OF INTERVIEW, HE SPENT HOUR ASKING JOURNALISTS QUESTIONS ON SUCH TOPICS AS IRAQS IMAGE IN WEST. ON JULY 11 GOI SIGNED 20 MILLION DOLLAR CONTRACT WITH JAPANESE FIRM FOR CONSTRUCTION OF MICROWAVE NETWORK. PURCHASE OF EIGHT NEW A/C ANNOUNCED JULY 10 WHICH PRESUMABLY INCLUDING FIVE FOEINGS VALUED AT 55 MILLION DOLLARS. VICE PRESIDENT OF INTER- CONTINENTAL HOTELS SPENT JULY 12-14 HERE AT INVITATION OF MINISTRY CONFIDENTIAL OF PLANNING, WHICH WANTS INTER-CONTINENTAL TO BUILD HOTEL IN BASRA.\n5. ON JULY 8 MININT LTGEN SAADOUN GHAIDAN SENT CONFIDENTIAL MESSAGE TO BRITISH HOME SECRETARY REQUESTING THAT HE RECEIVE MEDICAL CARE IN UK FOR PARTIALLY PARALYZED ARM RESULTING FROM TWO BULLET WOUNDS HE RECEIVED DURING COUP ATTEMPT. BRITISH AGREED AND GHAIDAN WILL LEAVE FOR UK THIS WEEK WITH ENTOURAGE. IN ADDITION, WIFE AND CHILDREN OF PRESIDENT AL-BAKR ARE GOING TO UK ON HOLIDAY, AND TWO SONS OF LATE MINDEF SHEHAB HAVE ALREADY RETURNED TO STUDIES THERE. DIRGEN OF RCC ABDUL JALIL ALSO VISITING UK.\n6. ALTHOUGH RELATIONS WITH COMMUNIST STATES REMAIN CORRECT, COMMUNIST DIPLOMATS HAVE SHOWN SOME CONSTERNATION OVER DISAPPEARANCE OF SAMMARIE. COMMUNIST REPRESENTATION AT JULY 14-17 CELEBRATIONS SEEMS LOW LEVEL AND THEY ARE RECEIVING LITTLE ATTENTION IN PRESS. SOVIET REP EXPECTED TO BE R. RASHIDOV, CANDIDATE MEMBER OF POLITBURO FROM UZBEKISTAN, BUT AS OF JULY 15 NO DEL FROM USSR HAD APPEARED.\n7. COMMENT: IF ABOVE TRENDS CONTINUE IT WILL BE IMPORTANT THAT WESTERN COUNTRIES TAKE ACTIONS TO SHOW THAT SUCH POLICIES ARE IN IRAQS BEST INTERESTS. FOR EXAMPLE, ALGERIAN AMBASSADOR BELIEVES THAT WHEN SUBSTANCE OF INTERVIEWS WITH WESTERN JOURNALISTS GETS BACK TO IRAQ SADDAM IS GOING TO BE BRANDED A ""RIGHTEST"". THUS HE WILL NEED SOME SUCCESSES TO STRENGTHEN HIS POSITION. DETENTE WITH IRAN, WHICH WOULD GIVE REGIME GREATER SENSE OF SECURITY AND MIGHT ENABLE IT TO RESOLVE KURDISH PROBLEM, IS OF PRIMORDIAL IMPORTANCE. IT MAY EVEN BE PREREQUISITE TO RAPPROCHEMENT WITH WEST SINCE IN ABSENCE OF DETENTE WITH IRAN, IT WOULD BE DIFFICULT FOR REGIME TO ANTAGONIZE FURTHER SOVIET UNION, WHICH IS STILL ITS MAJOR PROTECTOR AGAINST EXTERNAL THREAT.

SUMMARY: FIRST EXECUTIONS OCCURED JULY 7 AND MORE EXPECTED. NO FOREIGN INVOLVEMENT APPARENT. RUMORED ARRESTS OF HIGH PARTY OFFICIALS AND BEHAVIOR OF REGIME SUGGEST BITTER INTRA-BAATH GANG WARFARE TAKING PLACE WITH LITTLE IDEOLOGICAL MOTIVATION; WINNERS LIKELY TO INHERIT WEAKENED REGIME. ARMY ROLE STILL AN UNKNOWN. END SUMMARY\n2. ACCORDING TO OFFICIAL ANNOUNCEMENT, DG OF SECURITY NAZEM KZAR AND 22 LESSER SECURITY OFFICIALS EXECUTED AT NOON JULY 7 CONFIDENTIAL AFTER BEING TRIED IN SECRET BY SPECIAL COURT. ANNOUNCEMENT SAID THIS WAS ONLY ""FIRST BATCH."" LATE JULY 8 RADIO ANNOUNCED\n3. THERE ARE WIDESPREAD RUMORS THAT ARRESTS HAVE INCLUDED HIGH BAATH OFFICIALS, INCLUDING ABDUL KHALEQ AL-SAMMARRAI AND MOHAMMAD FADHEZU BOTH MEMBERS OF REGIONAL COMMAND; PRESIDENT\n5. RADIO REPORTS SAMMARRAI SENTENCED JULY 8 TO LIFE IMPRISONMENT.\n4. MOST OBSERVERS STILL PUZZLED OVER MEN AND MOTIVES INVOLVED. ONLY TWO ELEMENTS SEEM CLEAR: (A) NO FOREIGN POWER ALLEGED TO BE INVOLVED NOR IS THERE EVIDENCE OF FOREIGN INVOLVEMENT. THERE IS HOWEVER INDICATION THAT SOVIETS MAY WISH TO EXPLOIT NEW SITUATION BY INTER ALIA OBTAINING GREATER ROLE FOR ICP IN RETURN FOR RENEWAL OF SUPPORT. (BAGHDAD 0389). (B) POPULATION SEEMS UNINVOLVED. NEITHER SIDE HAS APPEALED TO THE ""STREET"" AND BAGHDAD HAS BEEN NORMAL THROUGHOIT CRISIS WITH EXCEPTION OF OCCASIONAL SIGHT OF ARMED MEN SURROUNDING A HOUSE AT NIGHT WITH GUNS AT READY. ATTITUDE OF AVERAGE IRAQI APPEARS TO BE THAT ONE FACTION OF BAATH NO BETTER THAN ANOTHER SO HE HAS NO STAKE IN OUTCOME.\n5. BEYOND THESE TWO GENERALIZATIONS, ALL ELSE IS SPECULATION. PRESIDENT BAKR CONTINUES TO APPEAR AS FIGUREHEAD BUT SOME, SUCH AS TURKISH AMBASSADOR, BELIEVE HE IS STILL FORCE TO RECKON WITH. MININTERIOR GHAIDAN REPORTED TO BE PARTLY PARALYZED AND GOING ABROAD FOR REST AND TREATMENT. SADDAM HUSSEIN IS ONLY LEADER WHO CONTINUES TO APPEAR ALMOST DAILY IN PUBLIC. HE HAS CLAIMED NO MILITARY INVOLVED, BUT REAL ROLE OF ARMY REMAIN UNKNOWN. ARMY CAN HARDLY BE PLEASED THAT NET RESULT THUS\n6. HYPOTHESIS THAT SEEMS MOST VALID AT THIS TIME IS THAT RIVALS OF SADDAM HUSSEIN ACTED BECAUSE THEY FEARED HIS GROWING POWER. DIFFERENCES, SUCH AS THOSE OVER KURDS, SUPPORT FOR FEDAYEEN, AND PRAGMATIC POLICY TOWARD WEST, PERHAPS USED AGAINST HIM, BUT CONFIDENTIAL REAL MOTIVE MORE LIKELY WAS NAKED BID FOR POWER. SADDAM HUSSEIN WAS ALERTED AND MOVED RUTHLESSLY WITH PARTY MILITIA TO CRUSH IT. TWO GENERALS PROBABLY CAUGHT IN MIDDLE. NAZEM KZAR AND OTHERS NO DOUBT TORTURED TO IMPLICATE OTHERS AND FURTHER PURGE OF PARTY SEEMS LIKELY. IF ARMY REMAINS ON SIDELINES, THERE APPEARS BE GOOD CHANCE SADDAM CAN CONSOLIDATE HIS POSITION. OVER LONG RUN, HOWEVER, REGIME IS WEAKENED. MANY NEW ENEMIES WILL BE WAITING FOR REVENGE AND, PSYCHOLOGICALLY, COUP HAS DEALT BLOW TO BAATH BY DEMONSTRATING THAT AFTER FIVE YEARS IN POWER, BAATH HAS CREATED NO VIABLE POLITICAL NSTITUTIONS AND THAT IT IS JUST ANOTHER POLICE STATE WITH SAME INHERENT WEAKNESSES AND INSTABILITYF OTHER SUCH STATES.\n7. IF PRESS MAKES QUERIES ON EXECUTIONS, I RECOMMEND DEPT REFRAIN FROM COMMENTING ON GROUNDS IT PURELY INTERNAL MATTER. NO REFERENCE SHOULD, IN ANY CASE, BE MADE TO USINT REPORTING. LOWRIE\n",843274

DEPARTMENT APPRECIATES YOUR SUGGESTION PER REFTEL THAT USG SEEK TO TAKE OPPORTUNITY PRESENTED AFTER ABORTIVE COUP ATTEMPT TO FOSTER BETTER U.S./IRAQI RELATIONS.  RECENT INTERVIEW GRANTED TO WESTERN JOURNALISTS BY REVOLUTIONARY CONFIDENTIAL COMMAND COUNCIL (RCC) VICE PRESIDENT SADDAM HUSSEIN, IN WHICH HE STATES THAT IRAQ WOULD WELCOME BETTER RELATIONS WITH THE WEST AND SPECIFICALLY WITH US, IS SIGNIFICANT PUBLIC INDICATION OF IRAQI WILLINGNESS TO KEEP DOORS OPEN TO IMPROVED BILATERAL RELATIONS.  HUSSEINS ARTICLE RECEIVED PROMINENT PRESS PLAY IN NEW YORK TIMES AND WASHINGTON POST JULY 15 EDITIONS AND HAS BEEN INTER- PRETED BY PRESS AS INDICATION OF OPENING TOWARD THE WEST BY IRAQS LEADERSHIP (SUMMARY OF INTERVIEW FOLLOWS SEPTEL).\n2.  HOWEVER, WE THINK IT IS TOO EARLY TO DETERMINE EXACTLY WHAT CHANGES AND POLITICAL ORIENTATION, IF ANY, IRAQI REGIME WILL ADOPT IN AFTERMATH OF COUP ATTEMPT.  GIVEN THE IN-FIGHTING OF THE RULING BAATH PARTY OF IRAQ (BPI) AND THE POLITICAL ANTAGONISMS WHICH CAN BE EXPECTED TO PREVAIL AS A RESULT OF THE ABORTIVE COUP, WE THINK IT WOULD BE\n3.  IN THIS RESPECT WE FEEL THAT A NATIONAL DAY MESSAGE TO PRESIDENT BAKR FROM PRESIDENT NIXON AS SUGGESTED REFTEL, WOULD BE OVERDOING IT AT THIS STAGE.  HOWEVER, WE DO SEE MERIT IN SENDING A CONGRATULATORY MESSAGE ON BEHALF OF THE SECRETARY TO IRAQI FOREIGN MINISTER ABD AL-BAQI ON OCCASION NATIONAL DAYS CELEBRATIONS BETWEEN JULY 14 AND JULY 17 (MESSAGE CONTAINED SEPTEL).  MESSAGES HAVE BEEN EXCHANGED BETWEEN SECRETARY AND FOREIGN MINISTER ON ID AL ADHA AND THIS LEVEL OF EXCHANGE WOULD BOTH BE IN LINE WITH RELATIONS WE ENJOY WITH GOI AT THIS TIME AND CON- STITUTE MODEST NEW SIGNAL OF INTEREST.  WE DO NOT THINK THAT IT WOULD BE APPROPRIATE TO INCLUDE CONDOLENCES ON DEATH OF GENERAL SHIHAB.\n4.  IN LAST ANALYSIS, WE THINK WE SHOULD CONTINUE FOR NOW TO REMAIN AS ALOOF AS POSSIBLE FROM IRAQS INTERNAL POLI- TICAL AFFAIRS AND CONCENTRATE ON IMPROVING OUR RELATIONS AT THE ECONOMIC, COMMERCIAL AND CULTURAL LEVELS WHERE GRADUAL BUT TANGIBLE PROGRESS IS BEING MADE.  OUR BASIC POSITION IS THAT WE WOULD WELCOME AN IMPROVEMENT IN OUR CONFIDENTIAL RELATIONS WITH IRAQ AND WOULD CERTAINLY WELCOME THE RE- SUMPTION OF DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS WITH THOSE COUNTRIES WHICH SEVERED RELATIONS WITH THE UNITED STATES AFTER THE JUNE 1967 WAR.\n5.

              3 FRG Finance Minister Helmut Schmidt presented a somewhat                            pessimistic analysis of the present situation on the European monetary                            exchanges The primary factor in his view making for the recent                            decline of the dollar has been a runaway psychological loss of                            confidence brought about by several developments including the                            continuing US payments deficit and the feeling in Europe that current US                            policies will not be adequate to control inflationary pressuresIn midMay speculation against the dollar had                                resumed and the dollar continued to decline in value over the                                succeeding weeks He was reasonably hopeful however that                            the recent German revaluation of 55 percentThe revaluation occurred on June 29 would bring on a                            temporary period of stability in terms of the mark relationship to other                            European currencies within the snake End summary2 I called on Finance Minister Helmut                                Schmidt on July 3 to discuss the current monetary                            situation He began by saying that his government felt there had been no                            alternative to the most recent 55 percent revaluation of the Dmark if the snake were to be preserved                            although pressures from German industry against such action were heavy                            The current situation of the dollar on the exchanges was a deplorable                            one to be explained only in terms of a runaway psychological loss of                            confidence It obviously did not involve real values but there seemed                            to be a lack of confidence in US ability to control inflationary                            pressures reinforced by the continuing US payments deficit3 He and some his advisers had assumed Schmidt continued that further revaluation of the mark                            would also have a depressive effect on the dollar even though it did                            not have a direct impact on the dollarmark central rate This was not                            however the unanimous expectation within the German banking community                            and as a matter of fact Bundesbank President Klasen had argued that there would be a                            rise in the value of the dollar following the German action He had                            obviously been proved wrong4 Schmidt said that he was                            reasonably optimistic that heavy pressures would now subside on the                            currencies within the snake although he allowed for the possibility of some movement upward                            of the Dmark One stabilizing factor                            would be the seasonal outpouring of German tourists all over Europe                            exchanging large amounts of marks for local currencies5 As far as the dollar was concerned Schmidt emphasized he would not particularly welcome US                            intervention in its support at the present time if all that meant was                            the use of DMs obtained under a swap                                arrangementIn February 1962 the US                                Federal Reserve System joined with central banks in other major                                industrialized countries to create an informal network of swap                                arrangements Essentially this network enabled a member country to                                draw upon lines of shortterm credit established with the other                                members in order to stabilize the value of its currency This                            would merely add to the inflationary pressures Schmidt continued within the FRG at a time when he believed the                            governments antiinflation measures were just beginning to take hold                            One thing the US could usefully do however was to sell some of its                            gold If we were willing for example to dispose of some 300 million                            worth of gold the FRG and perhaps some                            other European countries would be prepared to join in with additional                            gold sales His experts believed that in view of the narrowness of the                            gold market such sales would significantly reduce the present inflated                            price of gold The effect of any such reduction would be psychologically                            important in reducing pressures on the dollar since the present price                            of gold three times that of the official gold value of the dollar                            signaled to the entire world the weakness of the dollar6 In view of the widespread loss of confidence in the dollar Schmidt said he could not be other than                            gloomy about the possibility that the dollar might decline even further                            in value One thing clear was that he would not personally be identified                            with any further formal revaluation of the German mark He believed its                            overvaluation was already so great that with the change in the                            business cycle he anticipated next year German export industries would                            be hard hit as demand declined and it became obvious that their products                            had become overpriced in a contracting market It was the first time he                            had said this but if necessary the FRG                            would abandon the snake and let the DM                            float alone rather than revalue again in any form This would be both a                            political and an economic necessity for the German Government despite                            the negative effect it would have on the movement towards European                            monetary union Likewise the need to combat inflation in the FRG would make impossible any further                            support of the dollar by Bundesbank action on the exchanges such as had                            occurred in the past7 During our conversation I made the obvious arguments stressing that                            the kind of pessimism which he had expressed about US efforts to combat                            inflation were not warranted by the facts that price movements in the                            US would be favorable and that while certain price and demand                            inelasticities have perhaps proved more stubborn than anticipated a                            turnaround in the trade balance was already noticeable It was                            inconceivable I argued that such a drastic change in monetary parities                            as had occurred in recent years would not in the long run have the                            effect on imports and exports which classical international trade and                            monetary theory prescribed Although he acknowledged some of these                            points might be valid he was not prepared to deviate from the basic                            appraisal which he had made8 Comment:Schmidt is just about to depart on                            a fiveweek vacation which he hopes will not this year be interrupted by                            a monetary crisis as was the case in 1972 He was in one of his more                            didactic moods but his analysis was basically somber both as to the                            longrange implications of what he considers to be overvaluation of the                                DM and the prospects for the dollar                            He apparently has lost the inclination which he displayed during his                            earlier months as Finance Minister to rely on exchange controls in                            extremis since the experience of his government with controls during                            the past year was singularly unsuccessful in restricting the flow of                            dollars into GermanyHillenbrand,frus1969-76v31d44,"1.  SUMMARY:  IN A FRANK DISCUSSION WITH ME ON JULY 3, FRG FINANCE MINISTER HELMUT SCHMIDT PRESENTED A SOME- WHAT PESSIMISTIC ANALYSIS OF THE PRESENT SITUATION ON THE EUROPEAN MONETARY EXCHANGES.  THE PRIMARY FACTOR, IN HIS VIEW, MAKING FOR THE RECENT DECLINE OF THE DOLLAR HAS BEEN A RUN-AWAY PSYCHOLOGICAL LOSS OF CONFIDENCE BROUGHT ABOUT BY SEVERAL DEVELOPMENTS INCLUDING THE CONTINUING US PAYMENTS DEFICIT AND THE FEELING IN EUROPE THAT CURRENT US POLICIES WILL NOT BE ADEQUATE TO CONTROL INFLATIONARY PRESSURES.  HE WAS REASONABLY HOPEFUL, HOWEVER, THAT THE RECENT GERMAN REVALUATION OF 5.5 PERCENT WOULD BRING ON A TEMPORARY PERIOD OF STABILITY IN TERMS OF THE MARK RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER EUROPEAN CURRENCIES WITHIN THE SNAKE.  END SUMMARY\n2.   I CALLED ON FINANCE MINISTER HELMUT SCHMIDT ON JULY 3 TO DISCUSS THE CURRENT MONETARY SITUATION.  HE BEGAN BY SAYING THAT HIS GOVERNMENT FELT THERE HAD BEEN NO ALTERNATIVE TO THE MOST RECENT 5.5. PERCENT REVALUA-    SECRET\n3.   HE AND SOME OF HIS ADVISERS HAD ASSUMED, SCHMIDT CONTINUED, THAT FURTHER REVALUATION OF THE MARK WOULD ALSO HAVE A DEPRESSIVE EFFECT ON THE DOLLAR, EVEN THOUGH IT DID NOT HAVE A DIRECT IMPACT ON THE DOLLAR-MARK CENTRAL RATE.  THIS WAS NOT, HOWEVER, THE UNANIMOUS EXPECTATION WITHIN THE GERMAN BANKING COMMUNITY AND, AS A MATTER OF FACT, BUNDESBANK PRESIDENT KLASEN HAD ARGUED THAT THERE WOULD BE A RISE IN THE VALUE OF THE DOLLAR FOLLOWING THE GERMAN ACTION.  HE HAD OBVIOUSLY BEEN PROVED WRONG.\n4.   SCHMIDT SAID THAT HE WAS REASONABLY OPTIMISTIC THAT HEAVY PRESSURES WOULD NOW SUBSIDE ON THE CURRENCIES WITHIN THE SNAKE, ALTHOUGH HE ALLOWED FOR THE POSSIBI- LITY OF SOME MOVEMENT UPWARD OF THE D-MARK.  ONE STABILIZING FACTOR WOULD BE THE SEASONAL OUTPOURING OF GERMAN TOURISTS ALL OVER EUROPE EXCHANGING LARGE AMOUNTS OF MARKS FOR LOCAL CURRENCIES.\n5.   AS FAR AS THE DOLLAR WAS CONCERNED, SCHMIDT EMPHASIZED, HE WOULD NOT PARTICULARLY WELCOME US INTER- VENTION IN ITS SUPPORT AT THE PRESENT TIME IF ALL THAT MEANT WAS THE USE OF DMS OBTAINED UNDER A SWAP ARRANGEMENT.  THIS WOULD MERELY ADD TO THE INFLATION- ARY PRESSURES, SCHMIDT CONTINUED, WITHIN THE FRG AT A TIME WHEN, HE BELIEVED, THE GOVERNMENTS ANTI- INFLATION MEASURES WERE JUST BEGINNING TO TAKE HOLD. ONE THING THE US COULD USEFULLY DO, HOWEVER, WAS TO SELL SOME OF ITS GOLD.  IF WE WERE WILLING, FOR EXAMPLE, TO DISPOSE OF SOME 300 MILLION WORTH OF GOLD, THE FRG AND PERHAPS SOME OTHER EUROPEAN COUNTRIES WOULD BE PREPARED TO JOIN IN WITH ADDITIONAL GOLD SALES.  HIS    SECRET\n6.   IN VIEW OF THE WIDESPREAD LOSS OF CONFIDENCE IN THE DOLLAR, SCHMIDT SAID HE COULD NOT BE OTHER THAN GLOOMY ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY THAT THE DOLLAR MIGHT DECLINE EVEN FURTHER IN VALUE.  ONE THING CLEAR WAS THAT HE WOULD NOT PERSONALLY BE IDENTIFIED WITH ANY FURTHER FORMAL REVALUATION OF THE GERMAN MARK.  HE BELIEVED ITS OVER-VALUATION WAS ALREADY SO GREAT THAT, WITH THE CHANGE IN THE BUSINESS CYCLE HE ANTICIPATED NEXT YEAR, GERMAN EXPORT INDUSTRIES WOULD BE HARD HIT AS DEMAND DECLINED AND IT BECAME OBVIOUS THAT THEIR PRODUCTS HAD BECOME OVER-PRICED IN A CONTRACTING MARKET. IT WAS THE FIRST TIME HE HAD SAID THIS, BUT IF NECESSARY THE FRG WOULD ABANDON THE SNAKE AND LET THE DM FLOAT ALONE RATHER THAN REVALUE AGAIN IN ANY FORM.  THIS WOULD BE BOTH A POLITICAL AND AN ECONOMIC NECESSITY FOR THE GERMAN GOVERNMENT, DESPITE THE NEGATIVE EFFECT IT WOULD HAVE ON THE MOVEMENT TOWARDS EUROPEAN MONETARY UNION.  LIKEWISE, THE NEED TO COMBAT INFLATION IN THE FRG WOULD MAKE IMPOSSIBLE ANY FURTHER SUPPORT OF THE DOLLAR BY BUNDESBANK ACTION ON THE EXCHANGES SUCH AS HAD OCCURRED IN THE PAST.\n7.   DURING OUR CONVERSATION I MADE THE OBVIOUS ARGU- MENTS, STRESSING THAT THE KIND OF PESSIMISM WHICH HE HAD EXPRESSED ABOUT US EFFORTS TO COMBAT INFLATION WERE NOT WARRANTED BY THE FACTS, THAT PRICE MOVEMENTS IN THE US WOULD BE FAVORABLE, AND THAT, WHILE CERTAIN PRICE AND DEMAND INELASTICITIES HAVE PERHAPS PROVED MORE STUBBORN    SECRET     THAN ANTICIPATED, A TURN-AROUND  IN THE TRADE BALANCE WAS ALREADY NOTICEABLE.  IT WAS INCONCEIVABLE, I ARGUED, THAT SUCH A DRASTIC CHANGE IN MONETARY PARITIES AS HAD OCCURRED IN RECENT YEARS WOULD NOT IN THE LONG RUN HAVE THE EFFECT ON IMPORTS AND EXPORTS WHICH CLASSICAL INTERNATIONAL TRADE AND MONETARY THEORY PRES- CRIBED.  ALTHOUGH HE ACKNOWLEDGED SOME OF THESE POINTS MIGHT BE VALID, HE WAS NOT PREPARED TO DEVIATE FROM THE BASIC APPRAISAL WHICH HE HAD MADE.\n8.  COMMENT:  SCHMIDT IS JUST ABOUT TO DEPART ON A FIVE-WEEK VACATION WHICH HE HOPES WILL NOT THIS YEAR BE INTERRUPTED BY A MONETARY CRISIS AS WAS THE CASE IN L972.  HE WAS IN ONE OF HIS MORE DIDACTIC MOODS, BUT HIS ANALYSIS WAS BASICALLY SOMBER, BOTH AS TO THE LONG-RANGE IMPLICATIONS OF WHAT HE CONSIDERS TO BE OVER- VALUATION OF THE DM AND THE PROSPECTS FOR THE DOLLAR. HE APPARENTLY HAS LOST THE INCLINATION WHICH HE DIS- PLAYED DURING HIS EARLIER MONTHS AS FINANCE MINISTER TO RELY ON EXCHANGE CONTROLS IN EXTREMIS, SINCE THE EXPERIENCE OF HIS GOVERNMENT WITH CONTROLS DURING THE PAST YEAR WAS SINGULARLY UNSUCCESSFUL IN RESTRICTING THE FLOW OF DOLLARS INTO GERMANY.

pressures would now subside on the                            currencies within the snake although he allowed for the possibility of some movement upward                            of the Dmark One stabilizing factor                            would be the seasonal outpouring of German tourists all over Europe                            exchanging large amounts of marks for local currencies5 As

               would merely add to the inflationary pressures Schmidt continued within the FRG at a time when he believed the                            governments antiinflation measures were just beginning to take hold                            One thing the US could usefully do however was to sell some of its                            gold If we were willing for example to dispose of some

 gold sales His experts believed that in view of the narrowness of the                            gold market such sales would significantly reduce the present inflated                            price of gold The effect of any such reduction would be psychologically                            important in reducing pressures on the dollar since the present price                            of gold three times that of the official gold value of the dollar                            signaled to the entire world the weakness of the dollar6 In view of the widespread loss of confidence in the dollar Schmidt said he could not be other than                            gloomy about the possibility that the dollar might decline even further                            in value One thing clear

great that with the change in the                            business cycle he anticipated next year German export industries would                            be hard hit as demand declined and it became obvious that their products                            had become overpriced in a contracting market It was the first time he                            had said this but if necessary the FRG                            would abandon the snake and let the DM                            float alone rather than revalue again in any form This would be both a                            political and an economic necessity for the German Government despite                            the negative effect it would have on the movement towards European                            monetary union Likewise the need to combat inflation in the FRG would make impossible any further                            support of the dollar by Bundesbank action on the exchanges such as had                            occurred in the past7 During our conversation I made the obvious arguments stressing that                            the kind of pessimism which he had expressed about US efforts to combat                            inflation were not warranted by the facts that price movements in the                            US would be favorable and that while certain price and demand                            inelasticities have perhaps proved more stubborn than anticipated a                            turnaround in the trade balance was already noticeable It was                            inconceivable I argued that such a drastic change in monetary parities                            as had occurred in recent years would not in the long run have the                            effect on imports and exports which classical international trade and                            monetary theory prescribed Although he acknowledged some of these                            points might be valid he was not prepared to deviate from the basic                            appraisal which he had made8 Comment:Schmidt is just about to depart on                            a fiveweek vacation which he hopes will not this year be interrupted by                            a monetary crisis as was the case in 1972 He was in one of his more                            didactic moods but his analysis was basically somber both as to the                            longrange implications of what he considers to be overvaluation of the                                DM and the prospects for the dollar                            He apparently has lost the inclination which he displayed during his                            earlier months as Finance Minister to rely on exchange controls in                            extremis since the experience of his government with controls during                            the past year was singularly unsuccessful in restricting the flow of                            dollars into GermanyHillenbrand,frus1969-76v31d44,"1.  SUMMARY:  STATE SECRETARY POEHL IN A CONVERSATION WITH ME TODAY INDICATED THAT THE GERMANS, POSSIBLY IN A JOINT APPROACH WITH THE FRENCH, MAY CALL ON THE US AT THE TIME OF THE JULY 30 C-20 MINISTERS MEETING FOR ADDITIONAL STEPS  TO STRENGTHEN THE DOLLAR.  POEHL WAS REASONABLY OPTIMISTIC THAT THE LIMITED INTERVENTION ON THE FOREIGN EXCHANGE MARKETS WOULD BE SUCCESSFUL, BUT DID NOT RULE OUT THE POSSIBILITY OF LARGE SCALE FLOWS WHICH WOULD PLACE THE FRG BEFORE THE POLICY CONFLICT BETWEEN THE REQUIREMENTS FOR INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL STABILITY AND THOSE OF ITS INTERNAL STABILIZATION PROGRAM. POEHL STRESSED THE POLITICAL REPERCUSSIONS OF CONTINUED INTERNATIONAL MONETARY CHAOS BROUGHT ON BY CONTINUED WEAKNESS OF THE DOLLAR.  POEHL INDICATED THAT SHOULD NEW STRAINS APPEAR IN THE EC SNAKE, ANOTHER SMALL REVALUATION OF THE DM MIGHT BE CONCEIVABLE.  A UNILATERAL DM FLOAT WOULD BE OUT OF THE QUESTION, IN HIS VIEW, AND HE WOULD ARGUE STRONGLY AGAINST IT.  END CONFIDENTIAL SUMMARY\n2.  IN MINISTER SCHMIDTS ABSENCE I CALLED ON FINANCE MINISTRY STATE SECRETARY POEHL TODAY FOR AN EXCHANGE OF VIEWS ON THE INTERNATIONAL MONETARY SITUATION. POEHL SAID THAT HE WAS CONVINCED THAT THE DOLLAR WAS NOW CLEARLY UNDERVALUED AND RELATIVELY OPTIMISTIC THAT THE MARKETS WOULD SOON RECOGNIZE THIS FACT.  HE, THEREFORE, ALSO WAS RELATIVELY OPTIMISTIC THAT THE INTERVENTIONS NOW TAKING PLACE ON BOTH SIDES OF THE ATLANTIC COULD BE KEPT TO AMOUNTS WHICH WHILE INFLUENCING THE EXCHANGE MARKETS WERE NOT SO LARGE AS TO EXPAND THE DOMESTIC MONEY SUPPLY IN GERMANY TO SUCH AN EXTENT AS TO CALL INTO QUESTION THE SUCCESS OF THE GERMAN STABILIZATION PROGRAM.  POEHL CONTINUED THAT, OF COURSE, IT WAS NOT POSSIBLE TO COMPLETELY RULE OUT SO LARGE A PRESSURE ON THE DOLLAR (PARTICULARLY IF IT CAME FROM AMERICANS THEMSELVES WHO WANTED TO GET OUT OF THE DOLLAR NO MATTER WHAT THE COST) THAT EXCHANGE RATES WOULD SINK DRASTICALLY IN THE ABSENCE OF REALLY MASSIVE INTERVENTION.  IN SUCH A CASE GERMANY WOULD BE FACED WITH THE DILEMA OF EITHER GIVING UP ON ITS DOMESTIC STABILIZATION PROGRAM OR SEEING COMPLETE CHAOS ON THE INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FRONT.  OPINION WAS DIVIDED AMONG GERMAN POLICY MAKERS WHAT TO DO IN SUCH A SITUATION BUT, HE, POEHL WOULD RELUCTANTLY OPT FOR MASSIVE INTERVENTION AT THE COST OF THE DOMESTIC STABILIZATION PROGRAM.\n3.  POEHL STRESSED THE POLITICAL REPERCUSSIONS THAT CONTINUED INTERNATIONAL MONETARY CHAOS GENERALLY ATTRIBUTED TO THE WEAKNESS  OF THE DOLLAR COULD HAVE IN EUROPE AND GERMANY.  THERE WERE ALREADY SOME NASTY UNDERTONES OF  ANTI-AMERICANISM AS A RESULT OF THE FEELING THAT THE US WAS UNWILLING TO BRING ITS OWN HOUSE IN ORDER OR ITSELF DO SOME- THING TO STABILIZE THE VALUE OF ITS CURRENCY.  WHILE THESE VIEWS WERE LARGELY IRRATIONAL, THEY NEVERTHELESS WERE A POLITICAL REALITY AND THIS ANTI-AMERICANISM WOULD GROW UNLESS SOME ORDER COULD BE RESTORED TO CONFIDENTIAL THE INTERNATIONAL MONETARY SCENE.  POEHL INDICATED THAT THE FRG WAS CONSIDERING MAKING SOME APPROACH XGDS-1 HILLENBRAND\n0.\n4.  POEHL SAID THAT IN RETROSPECT HE WAS MOST HAPPY WITH THE OPERATION OF THE EC SNAKE.  HE FELT THAT WITHOUT IT THE PRESSURE ON THE DM AND THE DOLLAR WOULD HAVE BEEN EVEN GREATER.  AS TO THE FUTURE, HE COULD SAY VERY CATEGORICALLY THAT GERMANY WOULD REMAIN WITHIN THE SNAKE AND THAT A UNILATERAL DM FLOAT WAS COMPLETELY OUT OF THE QUESTION.  WHILE ONE RECENTLY QUITE OFTEN HEARD OPINIONS TO THE CONTRARY,THERE WERE ONLY A FEW PERSONS WHO MATTERED IN MAKING A DECISION OF THIS SORT AND HE, POEHL, WAS SURE THAT THEY WOULD NOT AGREE TO A UNILATERAL FLOAT UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES.  POEHL CONCEEDED THAT GERMAN TIGHT MONEY POLICIES AND SOME SIGNS OF SUCCESS OF THE STABILIZATION PROGRAM WERE VERY LIKELY TO PUSH THE DM AGAIN TO THE UPPER BORDER OF THE SNAKE. HE INDICATED, HOWEVER, THAT IT WAS THE FRGS HOPE THAT THIS WOULD NOT HAPPEN UNTIL THE STABILIZATION PROGRAM WAS BEGINNING TO HAVE SOME SUCCESS.  IT THEN MIGHT WELL FIT INTO THE FRGS POLICY TO TAKE UP SOME OTHER EUROPEAN CURRENCIES IN THE OPERATION OF THE SNAKE.  THIS WOULD ALLOW IT TO BEGIN TO RELAX INTERNAL ECONOMIC POLICY(THROUGH AN INCREASE IN THE VOLUME OF MONEY) WITHOUT OVERT POLITICAL DECISIONS TO THIS EFFECT.  IT ALSO WOULD BRING SOME PRESSURE (THROUGH LOSS OF EXCHANGE RESERVES) ON GERMANYS EC PARTNERS FOR MORE STABILITY ORIENTED POLICIES. IN RESPONSE TO A QUESTION AS TO WHAT THE FRG WOULD DO IF THE DM SHOULD BEGIN TO PULL IN SIZEABLE AMOUNTS OF OTHER SNAKE CURRENCIES PRIOR TO SUCCESS OF THE FRGS STABILIZATION PROGRAM, POEHL SAID THAT IN THAT CASE ANOTHER SMALL DM REVALUATION VIS A VIS THE OTHER SNAKE CURRENCIES COULD BE CONSIDERED.  IN ANY CASE, THE ONE THING THAT WOULD BE OUT OF THE QUESTION WOULD BE A BREAK-AWAY OF THE DM FROM THE SNAKE IN ORDER TO FLOAT UNILATERALLY.  I COMMENTED THAT I HAD NOT GAINED THE IMPRESSION IN TALKING TO HIS MINISTER THAT SCHMIDT WOULD BE READY TO REVALUE THE DM ONCE MORE EVEN UNDER SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES (SEE PARA 6 OF BONN 9594).  POEHL SAID THAT IT WOULD CONFIDENTIAL THEN BE UP TO HIM TO PERSUADE HIS MINISTER IF THESE CIRCUMSTANCES SHOULD ARISE.  HE ADDED THAT SO FAR SCHMIDT HAD IN THE END ALWAYS FOLLOWED HIS ADVICE ON SUCH QUESTIONS AND STRESSED THAT HE WAS TALKING ONLY IN TERMS OF A SMALL REVALUATION A- GAINST THE OTHER SNAKE CURRENCIES, NOT IN TERMS OF A LARGE REVALUATION OR ONE AGAINST THE DOLLAR.

32,0.7076523912799634,9594 Pass Treasury and Federal Reserve Subject: Conversation with                            Finance Minister Schmidt1 Summary: In a frank discussion with me on July                            3 FRG Finance Minister Helmut Schmidt presented a somewhat                            pessimistic analysis of the present situation on the European monetary                            exchanges The primary factor in his view making for the recent                            decline of the dollar has been a runaway psychological loss of                            confidence brought about by several developments including the                            continuing US payments deficit and the feeling in Europe that current US                            policies will not be adequate to control inflationary pressuresIn midMay speculation against the dollar had                                resumed and the dollar continued to decline in value over the                                succeeding weeks He was reasonably hopeful however that                            the recent German revaluation of 55 percentThe revaluation occurred on June 29 would bring on a                            temporary period of stability in terms of the mark relationship to other                            European currencies within the snake End summary2 I called on Finance Minister Helmut                                Schmidt on July 3 to discuss the current monetary                            situation He began by saying that his government felt there had been no                            alternative to the most recent 55 percent revaluation of the Dmark if the snake were to be preserved                            although pressures from German industry against such action were heavy                            The current situation of the dollar on the exchanges was a deplorable                            one to be explained only in terms of a runaway psychological loss of                            confidence It obviously did not involve real values but there seemed                            to be a lack of confidence in US ability to control inflationary                            pressures reinforced by the continuing US payments deficit3 He and some his advisers had assumed Schmidt continued that further revaluation of the mark                            would also have a depressive effect on the dollar even though it did                            not have a direct impact on the dollarmark central rate This was not                            however the unanimous expectation within the German banking community                            and as a matter of fact Bundesbank President Klasen had argued that there would be a                            rise in the value of the dollar following the German action He had                            obviously been proved wrong4 Schmidt said that he was                            reasonably optimistic that heavy pressures would now subside on the                            currencies within the snake although he allowed for the possibility of some movement upward                            of the Dmark One stabilizing factor                            would be the seasonal outpouring of German tourists all over Europe                            exchanging large amounts of marks for local currencies5 As far as the dollar was concerned Schmidt emphasized he would not particularly welcome US                            intervention in its support at the present time if all that meant was                            the use of DMs obtained under a swap                                arrangementIn February 1962 the US                                Federal Reserve System joined with central banks in other major                                industrialized countries to create an informal network of swap                                arrangements Essentially this network enabled a member country to                                draw upon lines of shortterm credit established with the other                                members in order to stabilize the value of its currency This                            would merely add to the inflationary pressures Schmidt continued within the FRG at a time when he believed the                            governments antiinflation measures were just beginning to take hold                            One thing the US could usefully do however was to sell some of its                            gold If we were willing for example to dispose of some 300 million                            worth of gold the FRG and perhaps some                            other European countries would be prepared to join in with additional                            gold sales His experts believed that in view of the narrowness of the                            gold market such sales would significantly reduce the present inflated                            price of gold The effect of any such reduction would be psychologically                            important in reducing pressures on the dollar since the present price                            of gold three times that of the official gold value of the dollar                            signaled to the entire world the weakness of the dollar6 In view of the widespread loss of confidence in the dollar Schmidt said he could not be other than                            gloomy about the possibility that the dollar might decline even further                            in value One thing clear was that he would not personally be identified                            with any further formal revaluation of the German mark He believed its                            overvaluation was already so great that with the change in the                            business cycle he anticipated next year German export industries would                            be hard hit as demand declined and it became obvious that their products                            had become overpriced in a contracting market It was the first time he                            had said this but if necessary the FRG                            would abandon the snake and let the DM                            float alone rather than revalue again in any form This would be both a                            political and an economic necessity for the German Government despite                            the negative effect it would have on the movement towards European                            monetary union Likewise the need to combat inflation in the FRG would make impossible any further                            support of the dollar by Bundesbank action on the exchanges such as had                            occurred in the past7 During our conversation I made the obvious arguments stressing that                            the kind of pessimism which he had expressed about US efforts to combat                            inflation were not warranted by the facts that price movements in the                            US would be favorable and that while certain price and demand                            inelasticities have perhaps proved more stubborn than anticipated a                            turnaround in the trade balance was already noticeable It was

valid he was not prepared to deviate from the basic                            appraisal which he had made8 Comment:Schmidt is just about to depart on                            a fiveweek vacation

SUMMARY: IN AN INFORMAL BRIEFING OF JOURNALISTS FINANCE MINISTRY STATE SECRETARY POEHL, ACCORDING TO DPA, INDICATED THAT THE FRG IS CONFIDENT CONCERNING A FURTHER STRENGTHENING OF THE DOLLAR AND WELCOMES INCREASED DIRECT INVESTMENT IN THE US BY GERMAN FIRMS. POEHL NOTED THAT IN CONNECTION WITH THE GRANTING OF SWAP CREDITS THE US HAD RECOGNIZED ITS OBLIGATION TO SUPPORT THE DOLLAR EXCHANGE RATE.  HE STRESSED THE IMPORTANCE OF BLOC FLOATING IN THE SNAKE UNCLASSIFIED FOR THE FRG AND INDICATED THAT IT WAS OF GREAT IMPORTANCE THAT THIS SYSTEM (I.E., THE SNAKE) BE MAINTAINED.  POEHL INDICATED THAT WHILE THE FRG FAVORS FIXED PARITIES, HE SAW NO CHANCE OF A RETURN TO THEM IN THE IMMEDIATE FUTURE.  HE DID NOT EXPECT THAT THE NAIROBI IMF MEETING WOULD ALREADY BE IN A POSITION TO REACH AN AGREEMENT CONCERNING THE REFORMED INTERNATIONAL MONETARY SYSTEM. END SUMMARY\n2.  FINANCE MINISTRY STATE SECRETARY POEHL ON JULY 10 MET WITH JOURNALISTS FOR AN INFORMAL DISCUSSION OF THE INTERNATIONAL MONETARY SITUATION. THERE FOLLOWS AN INFORMAL EMBASSY TRANSLATION OF THE DPA REPORT RESULTING FROM THIS MEETING.\n3.  ACCORDING TO DPA POEHL INDICATED THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS CONFIDENT THAT THE EXCHANGE RATE OF THE AMERICAN CURRENCY WILL CONTINUE TO STRENGTHEN IN THE NEAR TERM.  ALL DATA POINTS IN THE DIRECTION OF AN IMPROVEMENT OF THE AMERICAN BALANCE OF PAYMENTS. IN ADDITION POEHL EXPECTS A REVERSAL OF CAPITAL FLOWS.  NOT ONLY SHORT-TERM CAPITAL FLOWS WERE BEGINNING TO MOVE TOWARD THE US, POEHL ALSO IS VERY OPTIMISTIC CONCERNING DIRECT INVESTMENTS BY GERMAN FIRMS IN THE US.\n4.  ACCORDING TO DPA POEHL INDICATED THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WOULD WELCOME AND ENCOURAGE STEPS BY GERMAN BUSINESS TO CREATE PRODUCTION FACILITIES OR PARTICIPATIONS IN THE US.  NEVERTHELESS, THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT CONTINUED TO CONSIDER IT OF URGENT IMPORTANCE THAT THE AMERICAN GOVERNMENT IN ITS INTERNAL ECONOMIC POLICIES SHOULD DO STILL MORE THAN UNTIL NOW FOR THE EQUALIZATION OF ITS BALANCE OF PAYMENTS.\n5.  POEHL INDICATED THAT THE CREDITS MADE AVAILABLE TO THE US FOR SUPPORTING THE DOLLAR HAVE NOT YET BEEN CALLED UPON.  THE BUNDESBANK HAS INTERVENED DURING THE LAST DAYS IN ONLY SMALL AMOUNTS.  POEHL NOTED THAT IN CONNECTION WITH THE GRANTING OF UNCLASSIFIED SWAP CREDITS THE US HAD RECOGNIZED ITS OBLIGATION TO SUPPORT THE DOLLAR EXCHANGE RATE.\n6.  ACCORDING TO POEHL THE SYSTEM OF BLOC FLOATING OF THE EUROPEANS HAS BEEN REMARKABLY SUCCESSFUL DURING THE LAST WEEKS IN PART DUE TO THE REVALUATION OF THE DM.  THE FEDERAL REPUBLIC HAD EMERGED IN THE LAST WEEKS WITHOUT ANY DAMAGE FROM THE SERIOUS CRISIS OF THE DOLLAR.  THE FEDERAL REPUBLIC AS WELL AS THE OTHER PARTNERS IN THE SNAKE HAVE A STRONG INTEREST TO MAINTAIN THIS SYSTEM (OF BLOC FLOATING).  THIS INTEREST IS FOUNDED NOT ONLY ON POLITICAL CONSIDERATIONS, BUT ALSO ON STRONG ECONOMIC REASONS.  FIFTY PERCENT OF GERMAN EXPORTS CAN (WITHIN THE BLOC) BE UNDER- TAKEN WITH FIXED PARITIES.  THIS IS IMPORTANT IN VIEW OF THE FANTASTIC REVALUATION RATE OF THE DM VIS A VIS THE DOLLAR.  SINCE THE MIDDLE OF\n7.  CONCERNING THE REFORM OF THE INTERNATIONAL MONETARY SYSTEM, DPA QUOTES POEHL AS INDICATING THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT, TOO, FAVORED A SYSTEM UNCLASSIFIED WITH FIXED PARITIES.  HE, POEHL, HOWEVER SAW NO POSSIBILITY FOR (SUCH FIXED PARITIES) IN THE FORE- SEEABLE FUTURE.  FIRST IT WOULD BE NECESSARY TO DETERMINE HOW THE DOLLAR SHOULD BE VALUED.  POEHL CONTINUED THAT THE MOST IMPORTANT INDUSTRIAL COUNTRIES WERE AGREED ON THE MAIN PRINCIPLES OF A REFORMED INTERNATIONAL MONETARY SYSTEM.  HE DID NOT FORESEE, HOWEVER, THAT IT WOULD  BE POSSIBLE TO REACH AN AGREEMENT CONCERNING THE NEW SYSTEM DURING THE WORLD MONETARY CONFERENCE IN NAIROBI AT THE END OF SEPTEMBER OF THIS YEAR.  HE INDICATED THAT THE  FINANCE MINISTERS OF THE C-20 WOULD MEET IN WASHINGTON AT THE END OF JULY TO CONDUCT PREPARATORY TALKS CONCERNING THE NAIROBI CONFERENCE. HILLENBRAND\n",844600

stabilizing factor                            would be the seasonal outpouring of German tourists all over Europe                            exchanging large amounts of marks for local currencies5 As far as the dollar was concerned Schmidt emphasized he would not particularly welcome US                            intervention in its support at the present time if all that meant was                            the use of DMs obtained under a swap                                arrangementIn February 1962 the US                                Federal Reserve System joined with central banks in other major                                industrialized countries to create an informal network of swap                                arrangements Essentially this network enabled a member country to                                draw upon lines of shortterm credit established with the other                                members in order to stabilize the value of its currency This                            would merely add to the inflationary pressures Schmidt continued within the FRG at a time when he believed the                            governments antiinflation measures were just beginning to take hold                            One thing the US could usefully do however was to sell some of its                            gold If we were willing for example to dispose of some 300 million                            worth of gold the FRG and perhaps some                            other European countries would be prepared to join in with additional                            gold sales His experts believed that in view of the narrowness of the                            gold market such sales would significantly reduce the present inflated                            price of gold The effect of any such reduction would be psychologically                            important in reducing pressures on the dollar since the present price                            of gold three times that of the official gold value of the dollar                            signaled to the entire world the weakness of the dollar6 In view of the widespread loss of confidence in the dollar Schmidt said he could not be other than                            gloomy about the possibility that the dollar might decline even further                            in value One thing clear was that he would not personally be identified                            with any further formal revaluation of the German mark He believed its                            overvaluation was already so great that with the change in the                            business cycle he anticipated next year German export industries would                            be hard hit as demand declined and it became obvious that their products                            had become overpriced in a contracting market It was the first time he                            had said this but if necessary the FRG                            would abandon the snake and let the DM                            float alone rather than revalue again in any form This would be both a                            political and an economic necessity for the German Government despite                            the negative effect it would have on the movement towards European                            monetary union Likewise the need to combat inflation in the FRG would make impossible any further                            support of the dollar by Bundesbank action on the exchanges such as had                            occurred in the past7 During our conversation I made the obvious arguments stressing that                            the kind of pessimism which he had expressed about US efforts to combat                            inflation were not warranted by the facts that price movements in the                            US would be favorable and that while certain price and demand                            inelasticities have perhaps proved more stubborn than anticipated a                            turnaround in the trade balance was already noticeable It was                            inconceivable I argued that such a drastic change in monetary parities                            as had occurred in recent years would not in the long run have the                            effect on imports and exports which classical international trade and                            monetary theory prescribed Although he acknowledged some of these                            points might be valid he was not prepared to deviate from the basic                            appraisal which he had made8 Comment:Schmidt is just about to depart on                            a fiveweek vacation which he hopes will not this year be interrupted by                            a monetary crisis as was the case in 1972 He was in one of his more                            didactic moods but his analysis was basically somber both as to the                            longrange implications of what he considers to be overvaluation of the                                DM and the prospects for the dollar                            He apparently has lost the inclination which he displayed during his                            earlier months as Finance Minister to rely on exchange controls in                            extremis since the experience of his government with controls during                            the past year was singularly unsuccessful in restricting the flow of                            dollars into GermanyHillenbrand,frus1969-76v31d44,"1.  SUMMARY:  STATE SECRETARY POEHL IN A CONVERSATION WITH ME TODAY WAS RELATIVELY RELAXED CONCERNING THE CURRENT MONETARY SITUATION AND INDICATED THAT IN HIS VIEW THE DOLLAR/DM RATE WOULD STABILIZE IN THE DM 2.30-2.40 RANGE IN THE SHORT TERM WITHOUT THE NEED FOR MASSIVE INTERVENTION AND DESPITE OF SOME RENEWED ASSET SWITCHING INTO THE DM BY CENTRAL BANKS.  POEHL FELT THAT GERMANY PROBABLY SHOULD BEGIN TO RELAX ITS EXTREMELY TIGHT MONETARY POLICIES IN THE FALL AND THAT THE INFLOW OF OTHER EC CURRENCIES THROUGH THE OPERATION OF THE EC SNAKE MIGHT BE AN ELEGANT WAY OF ACCOMPLISHING THIS.  POEHL WAS GENERALLY RELAXED REGARDING US DOMESTIC ECONOMIC POLICIES AND NO LONGER SEEMED TO ENVISAGE A STRONG FRG DEMARCHE IN THIS FIELD AT THE TIME OF THE UPCOMING C-20 MINISTERIAL MEETING. THE FRG IS STILL CONSIDERING WHETHER TO SUGGEST A LARGE US DOLLAR BOND ISSUE ON THE EURO-MARKET.  POEHL WILL BE SUGGESTING TO MINISTER SCHMIDT AN FRG CONFIDENTIAL INITIATIVE AT THE C-20 FOR COMPROMISES ON ALL THE MAJOR OUTSTANDING INTERNATIONAL MONETARY REFORM ISSUES.  HE WILL, HOWEVER, NOT SEE SCHMIDT PRIOR TO HIS ARRIVAL IN WASHINGTON AND IS NOT YET SURE OF SCHMIDTS REACTION TO THE PROPOSED INITIATIVE.  END SUMMARY\n2.  AS WE HAD AGREED AT OUR LAST MEETING (SEE REFTEL), I AGAIN MET TODAY WITH STATE SECRETARY POEHL FOR AN EXCHANGE OF VIEWS CONCERNING THE INTERNATIONAL MONETARY SITUATION AND THE UPCOMING C-20 MINISTERIAL MEETING IN WASHINGTON.  POEHL SAID THAT HE WAS RELATIVELY RELAXED CONCERNING THE CURRENT MONETARY SITUATION.  THERE HAD BEEN ONLY MINIMAL INTERVENTION ON THE FOREIGN EXCHANGE MARKETS AND THE DOLLAR/DM RATE SEEMED TO BE STABILIZING IN THE $L EQUAL TO DM 2.30-2.40 ZONE.  THE GERMANS HAD INDICATIONS THAT SOME CENTRAL BANKS WERE AGAIN SWITCHING DOLLARS INTO DM AND THIS WAS PUTTING SOME PRESSURE ON THE RATE AND PREVENTING IT FROM RISING INTO THE UPPER\n2.30S.  ON THE OTHER HAND THESE CENTRAL BANKS SEEMED TO GET OUT OF THE MARKET WHEN THE DOLLAR SANK BELOW DM2.30 AND THIS GAVE THE RATE SOME STABILITY.  POEHL SAID THAT HE ASSUMED THAT THE CENTRAL BANK SWITCHES INTO DM WAS SOMETHING ONE HAD TO RESIGN ONESELF TO.  THERE WAS NOT MUCH ONE COULD DO ABOUT IT AND IN A SENSE IT COULD BE CONSIDERED TO FIT IN WITH THE INTENTIONS IN THE INTERNATIONAL MONETARY REFORM TO GET AWAY FROM ONE SINGLE RESERVE CURRENCY.  THE OIL PRODUCING COUNTRIES WERE A SPECIAL CASE, HOWEVER, AND AT SOME POINT ONE WOULD HAVE TO TALK TO THEM ABOUT THEIR INVESTMENT POLICIES.  POEHL SPECIFICALLY MENTIONED KENYA AND MALTA AS COUNTRIES CURRENTLY SWITCHING CENTRAL BANK ASSETS INTO DM AND OBSERVED THAT MALTA PROBABLY WAS NOT ACTING FOR ITSELF, BUT FOR LIBYA AND POSSIBLY OTHER ARAB COUNTRIES.  HE ALSO MENTIONED THAILAND AND CEYLON AS THE TYPE OF COUNTRIES WHO COULD BE EXPECTED TO WANT TO SWITCH SOME CENTRAL BANK ASSETS INTO DM.\n3.  POEHL SAID THAT THE CURRENT VERY HIGH GERMAN CONFIDENTIAL DAILY MONEY RATES ALSO WERE CONTRIBUTING TO THE STRENGTH OF THE DM AND HE HOPED THAT SOMETHING COULD BE DONE ABOUT THEM.  POEHL CONTINUED TO PROFESS OPTIMISM CONCERNING THE EC SNAKE.  HE RULED OUT ANY FURTHER DM REVALUATIONS AND SPECULATED THAT IF THE FRG, AS WAS LIKELY, SHOULD BEGIN TO XGDS-1 HILLENBRAND\n4.  POEHL WAS CONSIDERABLY MORE RELAXED THAN AT OUR LAST MEETING CONCERNING US DOMESTIC ECONOMIC POLICIES OR A POSSIBLE FRG DEMAND CONCERNING THEM AT THE TIME OF THE C-20 MINISTERIAL MEETING.  HE SAID THAT THE FRG WAS NOT LIKELY TO PRESS US FOR ANYTHING OTHER THAN A GENERAL CONTINUATION OF AS RESTRICTIVE DOMESTIC POLICIES AS POSSIBLE. GISCARD PROBABLY WOULD MAKE SOME STATEMENTS ALONG THE LINES OF HIS RECENT PUBLIC REMARKS, BUT POEHL CHARACTERIZED THEM AS ""ONLY WORDS"" SINCE IN FACT THERE WAS NOT MUCH THAT COULD BE DONE AND FRANCE DID NOT REALLY KNOW WHAT IT WANTED DONE.  ON THE INTERNATIONAL SIDE POEHL THOUGHT THAT THERE WERE SOME THINGS THAT MIGHT BE DONE.  HE AGAIN MENTIONED CONFIDENTIAL GOLD SALES ON THE FREE MARKET AND OBSERVED THAT THE PROBLEM HERE WAS FRANCE.  HE ALSO INDICATED THAT THE FRG WAS STILL CONSIDERING WHETHER TO SUGGEST A LARGE US DOLLAR BOND ISSUE ON THE EURO- MARKET.  THE FINAL FRG POSITION WILL ONLY BE DETERMINED WHEN HE GETS TOGETHER WITH MINISTER SCHMIDT WHO WILL BE TRAVELING TO WASHINGTON DIRECTLY FROM HIS VACATION.  BUT HE, POEHL, NO LONGER SEEMED TO BE THINKING OF A STRONG FRG INITIATIVE IN THIS FIELD VIS A VIS THE US (SEE REFTEL), BUT RATHER OF A RELATIVELY RELAXED MEDIATOR ROLE.\n5.  CONCERNING THE MONETARY REFORM DISCUSSION AT THE C-20, POEHL SAID THAT HE PERSONALLY WAS BECOMING INCREASINGLY CONVINCED THAT IT WOULD BE POLITICALLY NECESSARY TO COME OUT OF THE NAIROBI MEETING WITH A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF REAL AGREEMENT ON THE INTER- NATIONAL MONETARY REFORM.  HE THEREFORE FELT IT IMPORTANT THAT THE C-20 MINISTERS REACH COMPROMISES AT THEIR UPCOMING MEETING.  HE AND HIS STAFF WERE PREPARING GERMAN SUGGESTIONS FOR SUCH COMPROMISES ON ALL OF THE MAJOR ISSUES WHICH IN RESPONSE TO A QUESTION HE ENUMERATED TO BE THE ADJUSTMENT PROCESS, ASSET SETTLEMENT, GOLD, THE LINK AND MORE TECHNICAL PROBLEMS CONCERNING SDRS. I AND THE FINANCIAL ATTACHE TRIED TO PROBE POEHL CONCERNING THE NATURE OF THE COMPROMISES THE GERMANS MIGHT PROPOSE.  HE DECLINED TO GO INTO ANY DETAIL, HOWEVER, SAYING THAT HE HAD NOT YET HAD A CHANCE TO DISCUSS THESE IDEAS WITH MINISTER SCHMIDT. AS WE KNOW, MINISTER SCHMIDT HAD IN THE PAST TENDED TO CONSIDER THE REFORM DISCUSSIONS NOT TO BE OF VERY GREAT URGENCY AND HAD FELT THERE WAS SOME ADVANTAGE IN NOT PUSHING THEM TOO VIGOROUSLY UNTIL THE DOLLAR AND THE US BALANCE OF PAYMENTS HAD STRENGTHENED.  HE, POEHL, DID NOT KNOW THEREFORE WHETHER, TO WHAT EXTENT AND IN WHAT FORM SCHMIDT MIGHT NOW WANT TO PRESS FOR COMPROMISES AT THE UPCOMING C-20 MEETING AND IN ADDITION DID NOT KNOW HOW SCHMIDT WOULD REACT TO THE SPECIFIC PROPOSALS CONFIDENTIAL WORKED OUT BY HIS STAFF.  POEHL DID MENTION, HOWEVER, THAT ON ASSET SETTLEMENT HE COULD IMAGINE A SYSTEM WHEREBY THE MAJOR INDUSTRIAL COUNTRIES WOULD AGREE ON PRIME ASSET SETTLEMENTS (BETWEEN THEMSELVES?) WHILE ALLOWING A LESS STRICT SYSTEM FOR THE LDCS.\n6.  COMMENT:  WHETHER POEHLS MORE RELAXED ATTITUDE WILL ACTUALLY BE REFLECTED IN WHAT MINISTER SCHMIDT SAYS WHEN HE COMES TO WASHINGTON REMAINS TO BE SEEN. THE FINANCE MINISTER HAS DEMONSTRATED IN THE PAST HIS CAPACITY TO INJECT CONSIDERABLE EMOTIONAL CONTENT INTO DISCUSSIONS OF MONETARY PROBLEMS. HILLENBRAND\n",849501
34,0.6572256020773254,9594 Pass Treasury and Federal Reserve Subject: Conversation with                            Finance Minister Schmidt1 Summary: In a frank discussion with me on July                            3 FRG Finance Minister Helmut Schmidt presented a somewhat                            pessimistic analysis of the present situation on the European monetary                            exchanges The primary factor in his view making for the recent                            decline of the dollar has been a runaway psychological loss of                            confidence brought about by several developments including the                            continuing US payments deficit and the feeling in Europe that current US                            policies will not be adequate to control inflationary pressuresIn midMay speculation against the dollar had                                resumed and the dollar continued to decline in value over the                                succeeding weeks He was reasonably hopeful however that                            the recent German revaluation of 55 percentThe revaluation occurred on June 29 would bring on a                            temporary period of stability in terms of the mark relationship to other                            European currencies within the snake End summary2 I called on Finance Minister Helmut                                Schmidt on July 3 to discuss the current monetary                            situation He began by saying that his government felt there had been no                            alternative to the most recent 55 percent revaluation of the Dmark if the snake were to be preserved                            although pressures from German industry against such action were heavy                            The current situation of the dollar on the exchanges was a deplorable                            one to be explained only in terms of a runaway psychological loss of                            confidence It obviously did not involve real values but there seemed                            to be a lack of confidence in US ability to control inflationary                            pressures reinforced by the continuing US payments deficit3 He and some his advisers had assumed Schmidt continued that further revaluation of the mark                            would also have a depressive effect on the dollar even though it did                            not have a direct impact on the dollarmark central rate This was not                            however the unanimous expectation within the German banking community                            and as a matter of fact Bundesbank President Klasen had argued that there would be a                            rise in the value of the dollar following the German action He had                            obviously been proved wrong4 Schmidt said that he was                            reasonably optimistic that heavy pressures would now subside on the                            currencies within the snake although he allowed for the possibility of some movement upward                            of the Dmark One stabilizing factor                            would be the seasonal outpouring of German tourists all over Europe                            exchanging large amounts of marks for local currencies5 As

SUMMARY. SEVERAL JOURNALISTS WHO MEET REGULARLY WITH PRESIDENT POMPIDOU HAVE RECENTLY REMARKED TO EMBASSY OFFICERS ON DIFFERENT OCCASIONS, BUT IN ALMOST IDENTICAL TERMS, THAT PRESIDENTS CURRENT MOOD IS ONE OF DEEP PESSIMISM. POMPIDOU REPORTEDLY IS BROODING OVER MONETARY CRISIS, DISARRAY OF WESTERN CAMP AND FRENCH IMPOTENCE TO CHANGE SITUATION. HE IS SAID TO PORTRAY WESTERN EUROPE AS ON THE BRINK OF RAPID AND POSSIBLY BRUTAL CONFIDENTIAL SLIDE TOWARDS WHAT HE CHARACTERIZES AS ""FINLANDIZATION."" END SUMMARY.\n2. ACCORDING TO OUR SOURCES, POMPIDOU SEES DOLLAR CRISIS AS GENERALLY DEBILITATING FOR WEST. IN ADDITION TO PROBLEMS DOLLAR WEAKNESS CREATES IN TRADE AREA, HE BELIEVES IT WILL GENERATE INTENSE US CONGRESSIONAL PRESSURES TO REDUCE US FORCES IN EUROPE. THIS, PLUS WIDESPREAD BELIEF IN EUROPEAN CIRCLES THAT US AND USSR HAVE REACHED BILATERAL AGREEMENT WHICH PRECLUDES RESORT TO NUCLEAR WEAPONS IN EUROPEAN CONFLICT, CREATE GRAVE DOUBT ABOUT US WILLINGNESS TO DEFEND WESTERN EUROPE.\n3. RATHER THAN STRENGTHENING EUROPEAN UNITY, POMPIDOU BELIEVES SITUATION IS CREATING ""EVERY-MAN-FOR-HIMSELF PSYCHOLOGY"" AMONG EUROPEAN NATIONS. THUS, HE PERCEIVES REAL DANGER THAT FRG MIGHT ADOPT A MORE NEUTRAL ROLE IN EXCHANGE FOR SOME PROGRESS TOWARDS REUNIFICATION. HE BELIEVES SOVIET UNION IS WELL AWARE OF WESTERN VULNERABILITY AND HAS EVERY INTENTION OF EXPLOITING IT, ACCORDING TO OUR SOURCES.\n4. PARTICULARLY FRUSTRATING TO POMPIDOU IS THAT HE SEES NO EASY SOLUTION AND BELIEVES THAT GOF HAS LITTLE CONTROL OVER EVENTS. FRANCE CERTAINLY INTENDS TO MAINTAIN ITS OWN DEFENSE POSTURE AND POMPIDOU REPORTEDLY JUST APPROVED ENTIRE DEFENSE BUDGET FOR THE COMING YEAR. BUT THE PRESIDENT IS SAID TO BE KEENLY AWARE OF FRENCH INABILITY TO DO MUCH TO GUARANTEE EUROPEAN SECURITY.\n5. COMMENT: AFTER JUNE 6 COUNCIL OF MINISTERS MEETING, GOVERN- MENT SPOKESMEN SAID POMPIDOU REGARDED CURRENT MONETARY SITUATION AND INTERNATIONAL PROBLEMS AS EXTREMELY SERIOUS AND WOULD DISCUSS THEM IN MAJOR PUBLIC TELEVISION ADDRESS THIS FALL. WE HAVE ALSO HEARD THAT PRESIDENT INSTRUCTED JOBERT TO TAKE CAUTIOUS APPROACH DURING RECENT HELSINKI MEETINGS, TO ""WAKE PEOPLE UP TO WESTS INSECURITY."" THUS, WE ARE INCLINED TO BELIEVE THAT POMPIDOU IS NOT OVERDRAWING HIS CONCERN ABOUT MONETARY CRISIS FOR TACTICAL PURPOSES BUT IS SERIOUSLY WORRIED ABOUT MONETARY DISARRAY AND ITS POSSIBLE EFFECTS ON EUROPEAN SECURITY-- ESPECIALLY IN ACCELERATING MOVES TOWARD US FORCE REDUCTIONS.

SUMMARY. FOUR MONTHS AFTER THE MARCH LEGISLATIVE ELECTIONS, SALIENT FEATURES OF FRENCH INTERNAL POLITICS INCLUDE: (A) A SENSE THAT MESSMER GOVERNMENT IS DRIFTING, REACTING TO RATHER THAN INITIATING EVENTS -- EXCEPT IN DEFENSE AND FOREIGN POLICY AREAS WHICH REMAIN FIRMLY UNDER ELYSEE CONTROL; (B) BICKERING AND BACK-BITING BUT NO SIGN OF SERIOUS RUPTURE AMONG MAJORITY COALITION PARTIES; (C) SCRAMBLE FOR POSITION BY MAJOR AND SOME MINOR PRESIDENTIAL CONTEN- DERS. FIRST SESSION OF NEW ASSEMBLY ENDED JULY 3 AND POLITICAL ACTIVITY LIKELY TO DIMINISH, AS USUAL, TO NEAR-ZERO THROUGHTHE VACA- TION PERIOD. LONGER-RANGER GOF DIRECTION IN INTERNAL AFFAIRS AND ALIGNMENT OF POLITICAL FORCES SHOULD BECOME CLEARER AFTER THE CONFIDENTIAL  FALL RENTREE. BOTH WILL DEPEND IN LARGE PART ON PRESIDENT POMPIDOUS HEALTH AND ABILITY FULLY TO EXERCISE PRESIDENTIAL AUTHORITY. END SUMMARY\n2. PRESIDENT POMPIDOUS POOR PHYSICAL APPEARANCE DURING THE PAST FEW MONTHS AND RUMORS THAT HIS HEALTH IS SERIOUSLY DECLINING PROLONGE D SHAKE-DOWN PERIOD FOR NEW GOVERNMENT AND ASSEMBLY, INTENSIFIED RIVALRIES WITHIN THE MAJORITY COALITION AND GENERATED INTENSE JOCKEYI NG AMONG CONTENDERS FOR THE PRESIDENTIAL SUCCESSION. THE PRESIDENT HAS TAKEN FIRM MEASURES TO COMBAT ALLEGED LAME-DUCK STATUS BASED ON INCESSANT RUMORS THAT HE COULD NOT LONG CONTINUE IN OFFICE. ALTHOUGH HE CANCELLED APPEARANCES AT SEVERAL PUBLIC RECEPTIONS, HE MAINTAINED VIGOROUS SCHEDULE OF APPOINTMENTS AND TRAVEL DURING MAY AND JUNE. MOREOVER, HE SPREAD THE WORD THROUGH WELL-INFORMED SOURCES THAT HIS TENTATIVE PLAN IS TO RUN FOR PRESIDENCY AGAIN IN 1976. MOST IMPORTANTLY, HE HAS LOOKED FITTER IN RECENT PUBLIC APPEARANCES. IF AFTER REST DURING THE SUMMER POMPIDOU IS ABLE TO RESUME NORMAL ACTIVITIES THIS FALL, INCLUDING SCHEDULED TRIP TO CHINA IN SEPTEMBER, HE SHOULD HAVE NO DIFFICULTY REASSERTING FULL AUTHORITY, BOTH PERSONAL AND INSTITUTIONAL, OVER FRENCH POLITICS.\n3. IN ANY EVENT, DURING PAST FOUR MONTHS, POMPIDOUS COMMAND OF MAJOR PRESIDENTIAL RESPONSIBILITIES NEVER SLACKENED, I.E., THE AREAS OF FOREIGN POLICY, DEFENSE, INTERNATIONAL FINANCE AND TRADE. FOREIGN MINISTER JOBERT HAS, AS EXPECTED, PROVED AN UNSWERVING EXPONENT OF PRESIDENT POMPIDOUS FOREIGN POLICY. JOBERTS DEDICATION TO POMPIDOU LINE IS MATCHED BY ROBERT GALLEY, MINISTER OF ARMED FORCES. GALLEY HAS NEITHER THE PRESTIGE NOR THE POLITICAL CLOUT OF HIS PREDECESSOR, MICHEL DEBRE, AND, WHILE THERE IS NO REASON TO BELIEVE DEBRE DISAGREED IN ANY IMPORTANT WAY WITH POMPIDOU ON DEFENSE, EVEN THE POSSIBILITY OF DEVIATION FROM THE ELYSEE DEFENSE LINE HAS VANISHED WITH GALLEYS APPOINTMENT. FINANCE MINISTER GISCARD D ESTAING ENJOYS POWERFUL AND SOMEWHAT INDEPENDENT POSITION WITHIN GOVERNMENT BUT BASICALLY AGREES WITH POMPIDOUS APPROACH TO INTER- NATIONAL FINANCE AND TRADE.\n4. ON PURELY DOMESTIC SIDE, UNDER PRIME MINISTER MESSMERS TECHNICALLY COMPETENT BUT POLITICALLY COLORLESS DIRECTION, THE CONFIDENTIAL  GOVERNMENT HAS APPEARED TO REACT TO RATHER THAN INITIATE DEBATE ON MAJOR ISSUES WHICH HAVE SURFACED SINCE THE ELECTIONS, I.E.,  DEMAND FOR LIBERALIZATION OF ABORTION LAW, DEBATE ON MILITARY DEFER- MENTS, QUESTIONS OF WORKER-EMPLOYER RELATIONS, AND INFLATION. GOF REACTION TO THESE ISSUES HAS IN MOST CASES REFLECTED DEEP-SEATED CONSERVATIVE BIAS. DEFENSE MINISTER GALLEY, INTERIOR MINISTER MARCELLIN, CULTURAL MINISTER DRUON AND EVEN MORE PROGRESSIVE  EDUCATION MINISTER FONTANET HAVE ALL SHUNNED NEW IDEAS AND APPROACHES HAVE BEEN OUTSPOKENLY CRITICAL OF STUDENT AND LEFTIST MILITANTS, AND HAVE BEEN CONSISTENTLY SEVERE IN DEALING WITH DISSIDENT GROUPS.  GISCARD DESTAING HAS BEEN SLOW IN APPROVING WELFARE AND SOCIAL INFRASTRUCTURE EXPENDITURES, AND COMMERCE MINISTER ROYER HAS CHAMPIONED CONSERVATIVE INTERESTS OF SMALL SHOPKEEPERS AND  ARTISANS. THERE IS INDICATION, HOWEVER, THAT MESSMER MAY NOW BELIEVE GOVERNMENT HAS VEERED TOO FAR TO THE RIGHT. IN RECENT SPEECHES HE RENEWED COMMITMENT TO ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL REFORMS HE PROMISED DURING ELECTION CAMPAIGN. HOWEVER, HIS RECENT PLEDGE THAT THESE REFORMS WILL ONLY BE ENACTED INTO LAW DURING THE LIFE OF THE CURRENT ASSEMBLY, THAT IS BY 1978, REDUCED IMPACT IF NOT CREDIBILITY OF GOF COMMITMENT TO REFORM. (DURING CAMPAIGN, IMPLICATION WAS THAT REFORMS WOULD BE ENACTED IMMEDIATELY.) MAIN INTERNAL PROBLEM GOF WILL FACE THIS FAL L LIKELY TO BE RECONCILING DEMAND FOR INCREASED SPENDING ON SOCIAL PROGRAMS WITH NEED TO CONTROL INFOATION. THUS FAR, GOF ANTI-INFLATION MEASURES HAVE NOT BEEN SEVERE BUT MESSMER HAS THREATENED TAX INCREASES TO RECONCILE A BALANCED BUDGET WITH EXPENDITURES FOR ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND SOCIAL WELFARE.)\n5. THE BALANCE SHEET FOR THE FIRST SESSION OF THE NEW ASEEMBLY IS NOT IMPRESSIVE. TWENTY-SIX LAWS WERE ENACTED, INCLUDING CHANGE IN MILITARY DEFERMENT LAW, REFORM OF SEXUAL EDUCATION AND LIMITATION ON EMPLOYERS RIGHT TO FIRE EMPLOYEES WITHOUT CAUSE. BUT NONE OF THE LAWS DEALT WITH THE OVER-HAUL OF FRENCH SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC SYSTEM PROMISED DURING THE CAMPAIGN. IN FACT, THE MOST PASSIONATELY- DISCUSSED ISSUE DURING THE SESSION WAS THE GOVERNMENTS IMPOSITION OF 100-KILOMTER AN HOUR SPEED LIMIT ON ALL BUT FRANCES SUPER HIGHWAYS. ASSEMBLY DEBATES ON FOREIGN POLICY, DEFENSE, WIRE TAPPING AND CIVIL RIGHTS ROSE ONLY OCCASIONALLY ABOVE MUNDANE AND FAILED TO CONFIDENTIAL  CAPTURE GENERAL PUBLIC INTEREST. ATTENDANCE AT ASSEMBLY SESSIONS WAS EVEN MORE SPOTTY THAN IN PREVIOUS YEARS. HOPES GENERATED DURING ELECTION CAMPAIGN THAT AN ASSEMBLY MORE EVENLY BALANCED BETWEEN MAJORITY AND OPPOSITION WOULD PLAY A LARGER ROLE IN DETERMINING GOF POLICY WERE NOT REALIZED. EVEN UNDER ASSEMBLY PRES- IDENT EDGAR FAURES MORE DYNAMIC LEADERSHIP, THE ASSEMBLY, WITH ITS ABBREVIATED SESSIONS, ITS LACK OF POWER OVER THE PURSE STRINGS AND ITS INABILITY TO SUPERVISE IN ANY MEANINGFUL WAY MINISTERIAL ACTIVITIES, REMAINS AN ANEMIC INSTITUTIONTOTALLY OVERSHADOWED BY THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH.\n6. WITHIN THE ASSEMBLY, VOTING UNITY  OF MAJORITY COALITION PARTIES HELD ON ALL BUT ONE ISSUE: INDEPENDENT REPUBLICANS JOINED THE OPPOSITION IN DEFEATING A UDR MOTION TO REFER PROPOSED CHANGES IN ABORTION LAW TO A SPECIAL STUDY COMMITTEE. THIS MINOR BREAK IN RANKS UNDERSCORED UDR DEPENDENCE ON THE IRS TO MAINTAIN MAJORITY. IN GENERAL, HOWEVER, THE THREE COALITION PARTIES STAYED IN HARNESS AND ARE EXPECTED TO REMAIN UNITED IN THE ASSEMBLY ON ALL MAJOR ISSUES CONFIDENTIAL  FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE.\n7. POST-ELECTION PERIOD PROVED, HOWEVER, THAT UNITY OF THE MAJORITY COALITION PARTIES RESULTS FROM MARRIAGE OF CONVENIENCE, NOT LOVE. UDR SPOKESMEN HAVE BEEN VIRULENT IN RECENT ATTACKS IN GISCARD DESTAING. THEY RESENT HIS POPULARITY AND FEAR HE MAY ALREADY HAVE INSIDE TRACK IN THE PRESIDENTIAL SUCCESSION RACE. UDR ASSISTANT SECRETARY ALEXANDRE SANGUINETTI, WHO HAS BECOME THE PARTYS PRINCIPAL SPOKESMAN AND HATCHET MAN, HAS PUBLICLY SAID THAT THE UDR WILL SUPPORT ONLY A GAULLIST FOR THE PRESIDENCY OF POMPIDOU DECLINES TO RUN IN 1976. SANGUINETTI MADE IT CLEAR THAT THE UDRS CHOICE AS  OF NOW IS FORMER PRIME INISTER CHABAN-DELMAS. RECENT OPINION POLLS PROVIDE  KEY TO BOTH UDR CONCERN AND STEPPED-UP CANDIDATE MANEUVERING WHEN ASKED WHICH OF A NUMBER OF MAJORITY COALITION POLITICAL LEADERS HAS THE BEST FUTURE, 63PERCENT OF THOSE QUESTIONED NAMED GISCARD, WHILE 40PERCENT NAMED CHABAN-DELMAS. HOWEVER, WHEN VARIOUS  CANDIDATES ARE PITTED AGAINST THE MOST LIKELY LEFT-WING CANDIDATE, PS SECRETARY-GENERAL FRANCOIS MITTERRAND, THE RESULTS ARE AS FOLLOWS: (A) POMPIDOU, 55PERCENT; MITTERRAND, 30PERCENT; UNDECIDED, 15PERCENT. (B) CHABAN-DELMAS, 51PERCENT; MITTERRAND, 31PERCENT; UNDECIDED,\n8. PRESIDENTIAL CONTENDERS WILL CERTAINLY CONTINUE TO SEEK THE LIME- LIGHT AND BUILD SUPPORT DURING THE COMING MONTHS AND IT IS FAR FROM CLEAR WHO WILL REPRESENT THE GOVERNMENT COALITION IN 1976. IN ADDITION TO CHABAN AND GISCARD, PRIME MINISTER MESSMER IS A STRONG CONTENDER AND ASSEMBLY PRESIDENT EDGAR FAURE MUST BE REGARDED AS A POTENTIAL CANDIDATE. OTHER LESS LIKELY BUT POSSIBLE CANDIDATES FROM MAJORITY ARE AGRICULTURE MINISTER JACQUES CHIRAC AND MINISTER OF ARMED FORCES ROBERT GALLEY, AND BETWEEN NOW AND 1976 ENTIRELY NEW CANDIDATES COULD, OF COURSE, SURFACE.\n9. NOR IS IT CERTAIN THAT FRANCOIS MITTERRAND WILL BE THE ONLY LEFT STANDARD-BEARER IN THE RPESIDENTIAL RACE. THE SOCIALIST-COMMUNIST ALLIANCE REMAINS FRAGILE AND THE PCF MAY DECIDE TO FIELD A FIRST- CONFIDENTIAL  ROUND CANDIDATE. I THE IMMEDIATE FUTURE, HOWEVER, WE EXPECT THE SOCIALISTS AND THE COMMUNISTS WILL MAINTAIN THEIR SOMEWHAT UN- EASY ALLIANCE. EACH PARTY, HHWEVER, WILL SPARE NO EFFORTS TO  INCREASE ITS SIZE AND INFLUENCE AND REAFFIRM ITS AUTONOMY, EVEN AT THE PRICE OF RECIPROCAL IRRITATION AND HEIGHTENED SUSPICION OF THE OTHERS MOTIVES (SEE PARIS T-17858 OF JUNE 29).\n0. THE OTHER MAJOR OPPOSITION GROUP, THE CENTRIST MOVEMENT FOR REFORM, SHOWS SERIOUS SIGNS OF STRAIN. SSECRETARY-GENERAL OF THE RADICAL PARTY NICHOLS MALOUMIAN RECENTLY TOLD AN EMBASSY OFFICER THAT JEAN LECANUETS CENTER DEMOCRATIC PARTY AND JEAN- JACQUES SERVAN-SCHREIBERS RADICAL PARTY WILL ALMOST CERTAINLY SPLIT IN THE RELATIVELY NEAR FUTURE. MALOUMIAN SAID THE ONLY REASON THEY WERE STILL TOGETHER IN THE MOVEMENT FOR REFORM IS THAT NEITHER WANTS TO BEAR THE ONUS FOR BREAKING UP THE ONLY OPPOSITION CENTER GROUP. MALOUMIAN SAID HE BELIEVES LECANUET AND AT LEAST PART OF HIS GROUP WILL RALLY TO THE GOVERNMENT, PERHAPS BY JOINING FORCES WITH THE SMALLEST OF THE THREE MAJORITY COALITION PARTIES, THE DUHAMEL-FONTANET CENTER UNION. BUT, HE ADDED, THE RADICAL PARTY, ALONG WITH ALL OTHER LEFT-OF-CENTER ELEMENTS IN THE REFORM MOVEMENT, WILL STAY IN THE OPPOSITION THOUGH OUTSIDE THE UNITED LEFT. THE EFFECT OF A SPLIT WITHIN THE CENTER OPPOSITION ALLIANCE IS LIABLE TO BE NEGLIGIBLE IN THE ASSEMBLY SINCE ITS STRENGTH DOES NOT PERMIT IT THE PIVOTAL ROLE BETWEEN LEFT AND RIGHT THE MOVEMENT FOR REFORM WAS DESIGNED TO PLAY. IN THE LONGER RUN,\n1. COMMENT: WHILE MUCH OF THE POLITICAL EFFERVESCENCE THAT MARKS THE CURRENT INTERNAL SCENE IS RELATED TO THE FORTHCOMING PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS, IT IS FAR TOO EARLY, IN OUR VIEW, TO FORM EVEN THE MOST PRELIMINARY JUDGMENTS ABOUT THE 1976 CAMPAIGN. MAJOR UNANSWERED QUESTIONS ARE WHETHER POMPIDOU INTENDS TO RUN AGAIN AND, IF NOT, WHO IS CHOICE FOR SUCCESSOR WILL BE. AND DESPITE HITS HE PLANS TO RUN AGAIN, THERE IS NO REAL EVIDENCE THE PRESIDENT HAS MADE UP HIS MIND ON EITHER QUESTION. IRWIN\n",839907

40,0.9969865423432798,20620 Subject: Call on French Minister of Finance Giscard dEstaing1 During a call I made on Finance Minister Giscard dEstaing this afternoon he emphasized his                            concern with the current monetary situation He said he felt US                            political leaders did not understand the seriousness of the political                            problem which the decline of the dollar to a rate 10 percent below the                            February 12 parity was causing the French Government and other European                            governments too He mentioned a recent talk he had had with a French                            businessman who had expressed the fear he would be unable to compete in                            the US market at the present dollarfranc exchange rate and would have                            to let off substantial numbers of people If unemployment and political                            difficulties were thus to spread in Europe that would make monetary                            problem very much harder to resolve2 I questioned Giscard as to what                            alternative he saw to floating rates in the present transition period                                Giscard replied that the                            important thing was for the US to show willingness to support the                            dollar repeating that he believed the dollar was substantially                            undervalued perhaps as much as 10 percent He said he thought it could                            be supported at the present level through the use of swap facilities                            without getting into the more complicated problem of consolidation of                            balances He feels objective should be at a minimum to keep rate from                            falling below present level and if possible to achieve some                            recoverysay by about four or five percent above its present value He                            said he was not arguing we should support the dollar all the way back up                            to the level resulting from the devaluation He felt the US had made a                            mistake in taking a completely hands off attitude after the last                            devaluation3 I took issue with Giscards                            suggestion that the US was indifferent to the strength of the dollar                            I noted that the US had more than met the Presidents target of                            keeping government expenditures below 250 billion in FY 1973 and that the final budget deficit                            for FY 73 was 14 billion rather than the                            18 billion forecast in January I mentioned that President Nixon had expressed his determination                            to achieve a balanced budget in FY 1974                            I called attention to the strong Phase IV program for dealing with the immediate inflationary                            problems Finally I pointed to the second quarter trade results as                            evidence that our efforts were beginning to bear fruit Giscard agreed these were important                            developments4 In further discussion it became clear that Giscard feels that USEuropean differences over the                            monetary situation can have important repercussions on other issues                            particularly on the EC itself and on                            defense and security questions Resolving monetary problems would not                            resolve all other issues he said but a failure to resolve the monetary                            problems would certainly exacerbate other issues5 In parting Giscard commented                            that in diplomacy mistrust is deeprooted and hoped we could work                            together to deal with such mistrust by full and frank exchanges                            Accordingly we agreed to pick up discussion again in September6 In light of the seriousness of French concerns however I urged                                Giscard to speak directly to                            Secretary Shultz in Washington                            next week to explore possible solutionsIrwin,frus1969-76v31d48,"1. DURING A CALL I MADE ON FINANCE MINISTER GISCARD DESTAING THIS AFTERNOON, HE EMPHASIZED HI CONCERN WITH THE CURRENT MONETARY SITUATION. HE SAID HE FELT U.S. POLITICAL LEADERS DID NOT UNDERSTAND THE SERIOUSNESS OF THE POLITICAL PROBLEM WHICH THE DECLINE OF THE DOLLAR TO A RATE 10 PERCENT BELOW THE FEBRUARY 12 PARITY WAS CAUSING THE FRENCH GOVERNMENT AND OTHER EUROPEAN GOVERNMENTS TOO. HE MENTIONED A RECENT TALK HE HAD HAD WITH A FRENCH BUSINESSMAN WHO HAD EXPRESSED THE FEAR HE WOULD BE UNABLE TO COMPETE IN THE U.S. MARKET AT THE PRESENT DOLLAR/FRANC EXCHANGE RATE AND WOULD HAVE TO LET OFF SUBSTANTIAL NUMBERS OF PEOPLE. IF UNEMPLOYMENT AND POLITICAL CONFIDENTIAL DIFFICULTIES WERE THUS TO SPREAD IN EUROPE, THAT WOULD MAKE MONETARY PROBLEM VERY MUCH HARDER TO RESOLVE.\n2. I QUESTIONED GISCARD AS TO WHAT ALTERNATIVE HE SAW TO FLOATING RATES IN THE PRESENT TRANSITION PERIOD. GISCARD REPLIED THAT THE IMPORTANT THING WAS FOR THE U.S. TO SHOW WILLINGNESS TO SUPPORT THE DOLLAR. REPEATING THAT HE BELIEVED THE DOLLAR WAS SUBSTANTIALLY UNDER-VALUED PERHAPS AS MUCH AS 10 PERCENT HE SAID HE THOUGHT IT COULD BE SUPPORTED AT THE PRESENT LEVEL THROUGH THE USE OF SWAP FACILITIES WITHOUT GETTING INTO THE MORE COMPLICATED PROBLEM OF CONSOLIDATION OF BALANCES. HE FEELS OBJECTIVE SHOULD BE AT A MINIMUM TO KEEP RATE FROM FALLING BELOW PRESENT LEVEL AND, IF POSSIBLE, TO ACHIEVE SOME RECOVERY - SAY, BY ABOUT FOUR OR FIVE PERCENT ABOVE ITS PRESENT VALUE. HE SAID HE WAS NOT ARGUING WE SHOULD SUPPORT THE DOLLAR ALL THE WAY BACK UP TO THE LEVEL RESULTING FROM THE DEVALUATION. HE FELT THE U.S. HAD MADE A MISTAKE IN TAKING A COMPLETELY ""HANDS OFF"" ATTITUDE AFTER THE LAST DEVALUATION.\n3. I TOOK ISSUE WITH GISCARDS SUGGESTION THAT THE U.S. WAS INDIFFERENT TO THE STRENGTH OF THE DOLLAR. I NOTED THAT THE U.S. HAD MORE THAN MET THE PRESIDENTS TARGET OF KEEPING GOVERNMENT EXPENDITURES BELOW $250 BILLION IN FY 1973 AND THAT THE FINAL BUDGET DEFICIT FOR FY 73 WAS $14 BILLION RATHER THAN THE $18 BILLION FORECAST IN JANUARY. I MENTIONED THAT PRESIDENT NIXON HAD EXPRESSED HIS DETERMINATION TO ACHIEVE A BALANCED BUDGET IN FY 1974. I CALLED ATTENTION TO THE STRONG PHASE IV PROGRAM FOR DEALING WITH THE IMMEDIATE INFLATIONARY PROBLEMS. FINALLY I POINTED TO THE SECOND QUARTER TRADE RE- SULTS AS EVIDENCE THAT OUR EFFORTS WERE BEGINNING TO BEAR FRUIT. GISCARD AGREED THESE WERE IMPORTANT DEVELOPMENTS.\n4. IN FURTHER DISCUSSION IT BECAME CLEAR THAT GISCARD FEELS THAT US/EUROPEAN DIFFERENCES OVER THE MONETARY SITUATION CAN HAVE IMPORTANT REPERCUSSIONS ON OTHER ISSUES, PARTICULARLY ON THE EC ITSELF, AND ON DEFENSE AND SECURITY QUESTIONS. RESOLVING MONETARY PROBLEMS WOULD NOT RESOLVE ALL OTHER ISSUES HE SAID, BUT A FAILURE TO RESOLVE THE MONETARY PROBLEMS WOULD CERTAINLY EXACERBATE OTHER ISSUES.\n5. IN PARTING GISCARD COMMENTED THAT ""IN DIPLOMACY MISTRUST CONFIDENTIAL IS DEEP-ROOTED"" AND HOPED WE COULD WORK TOGETHER TO DEAL WITH SUCH MISTRUST BY FULL AND FRANK EXCHANGES. ACCORDINGLY WE AGREED TO PICK UP DISCUSSION AGAIN IN SEPTEMBER.\n6. IN LIGHT OF THE SERIOUSNESS OF FRENCH CONCERNS, HOWEVER, I URGED GISCARD TO SPEAK DIRECTLY TO SECRETARY SHULTZ IN WASHINGTON NEXT WEEK TO EXPLORE POSSIBLE SOLUTIONS. IRWIN\n",839640

45,0.7806057877576021,Secto 581570 Subject: CSCE Ministerial: SecretaryGromyko luncheon and bilateral July 71 Summary:Bilateral luncheon July 7 provided occasion for Secretary and Gromyko to review various matters relating to second stage of CSCE Gromyko stressed Soviet view that conference should produce binding results and that all other issues before conference should be considered secondary to security aspect Secretary noted that principles of relations to be agreed on by conference would be general in nature and therefore would not take the form of a treaty but of course the US would fully respect any agreements entered into On security issue Secretary pointed to diversity of viewpoints represented at conference and underlined US view that progress on cooperation issues in humanitarian area would also enhance security and constituted important goal of conference which could be attained within framework of respect for national sovereignty Gromyko urged continued USSoviet cooperation on conference matters and suggested possibility of bilateral consultations on MBFR Secretary pointed out US still in process of developing position for MBFR negotiations and Gromyko replied the same was true for his government End summary2 Gromyko hosted luncheon at Soviet Embassy for Secretary July 7 immediately following final session of CSCE first stage Mood was cordial with Soviets clearly gratified at success their last ditch leadership in working out compromise on MalteseArab issue which prevented Ministerial from ending on sour note induced by impasse over communiqu septelNot identified Telegram 1815 from Helsinki July 4 reported that the afternoon session of the CSCE Ministerial meeting opened with Maltese Prime Minister Mintoff calling attention to his proposal that Algerian and Tunisian FonMins be invited to address meeting Spain supported Malta but Bulgarian rep proposed remand matter to official level working group Greek Swiss and other ministers endorsed Bulgarian suggestion Mintoff said working group must reach prompt decision Telegram 1586 from Ottawa reported: Towards end of CSCE Ministerial session when it appeared no communiqu might be issued Canadian CSCE Coordinator Hooper reports Soviet del took up cudgels with Maltese and persuaded Mintoff to accept final language Hooper describes Gromyko as furious and quotes him as calling Mintoff unbalanced and untrustworthy Both in National Archives RG 59 Central Foreign Policy Files Discussion following luncheon provided occasion for serious exchange of views on issues facing second stage of conference3 Proposals on agenda items Gromyko asked whether US intended to submit concrete proposals during second stage Secretary responded affirmatively but indicated we did not yet know precise form proposals would take Gromyko noted that proposals submitted by Soviets and other socialist countries on various agenda items represented effort to get ball rolling4 Pace of stage II Gromyko expressed concern that second stage of CSCE might become unduly prolonged and expressed hope this could be avoided Secretary observed that US had agreed in joint communiqu during Brezhnev visit that conference should move forward as expeditiously as possible He said we fully intended to live up to this understanding but that pace of proceedings would also depend on positions adopted by others5 Binding nature of undertakings Gromyko reiterated standard Soviet view that any documents or undertakings resulting from conference should have maximum binding force so that Europe would not have to live with triggers cocked but could have genuine peace Secretary emphasized that US would not enter into undertakings we did not intend to respect He noted however that any principles that would be agreed on by conference would necessarily be general in form Accordingly while we are prepared to give them our full support this would not carry the same operational obligation which more specific agreements would carry As for other agreements that might result from conference Secretary drew distinction between agreements requiring Congressional approval and those that did not require Congressional approval to enter into force He expressed the view that agreements likely to result from CSCE would probably but not necessarily be of latter type In any event the US was prepared to support any agreements reached fully and without reservation6 Representation of stage II Secretary asked Gromyko for Soviet views on nature and level at which participants should be represented during stage II discussions Gromyko said representation should be at high level commensurate with increased importance of stage II over MPT although experts would again be present In Soviet case he assumed Deputy Foreign Minister would be appointed to attend stage II who would represent USSR on coordinating committee and possibly also on one or another of the special committees He emphasized that representatives must be at responsible level and empowered to speak with full authority of their government in order to keep matters moving7 Relative importance of CSCE issues Gromyko made special point of stressing primacy of security issue over all others at conference He claimed this in no way implied any underestimation by USSR of other matters before conference such as cultural cooperation family ties which he noted seemed to be particular concern of FRG Foreign Minister Scheel exchanges of people and information and other humanitarian issues Gromyko said there can and should be agreement on certain principles relating to these other issues: Soviets were not afraid of them but history and common sense showed that main issue before conference was to make Europe a continent of peace Accordingly issues other than security necessarily had to be secondary and conference should not try to get into field of bilateral agreements between states In addition such matters as

various matters relating to second stage of CSCE Gromyko stressed Soviet view that conference should produce binding results and that all other issues before conference should be considered secondary to security aspect Secretary noted that principles of relations to be agreed on by conference would be general in nature and therefore would not take the form of a treaty but of course the US would fully respect any agreements entered into On security issue Secretary pointed to diversity of viewpoints represented at conference and underlined US view that progress on cooperation issues in humanitarian area would also enhance security and constituted important goal of conference which could be attained within framework of respect for national sovereignty Gromyko urged continued USSoviet cooperation on conference matters and suggested possibility of bilateral consultations on MBFR Secretary pointed out US still in process of developing position for MBFR negotiations and Gromyko replied the same was true for his government End summary2 Gromyko hosted luncheon at Soviet Embassy for Secretary July 7 immediately following final session of CSCE first stage Mood was cordial with

that Algerian and Tunisian FonMins be invited to address meeting Spain supported Malta but Bulgarian rep proposed remand matter to official level working group Greek Swiss and other ministers endorsed Bulgarian suggestion Mintoff said working group must reach prompt decision Telegram 1586 from Ottawa reported: Towards end of CSCE Ministerial session when it appeared no communiqu might be issued Canadian CSCE Coordinator Hooper reports Soviet del took up cudgels with Maltese and persuaded Mintoff to accept final language Hooper describes Gromyko as furious and quotes him as calling Mintoff unbalanced and untrustworthy Both in National Archives RG 59 Central Foreign Policy Files Discussion following luncheon provided occasion for serious exchange of views on issues facing second stage of conference3 Proposals on agenda items Gromyko asked whether US intended to submit concrete proposals during second stage Secretary responded affirmatively but indicated we did not yet know precise form proposals would take Gromyko noted that proposals submitted by Soviets and other socialist countries on various agenda items represented effort to get ball rolling4 Pace of stage II Gromyko expressed concern that second stage of CSCE might become unduly prolonged and expressed hope this could be avoided Secretary observed that US had agreed in joint communiqu during Brezhnev visit that conference should move forward as expeditiously as possible He said we fully intended to live up to this understanding but that pace of proceedings would also depend on positions adopted by others5 Binding nature of undertakings Gromyko reiterated standard Soviet view that any documents or undertakings resulting from conference should have maximum binding force so that Europe would not have to live with triggers cocked but could have genuine peace Secretary emphasized that US would not enter into undertakings we did not intend to respect He noted however that any principles that would be agreed on by conference would necessarily be general in form Accordingly while we are prepared to give them our full support this would not carry the same operational obligation which more specific agreements would carry As for other agreements that might result from conference Secretary drew distinction between agreements requiring Congressional approval and those that did not require Congressional approval to enter into force He expressed the view that agreements likely to result from CSCE would probably but not necessarily be of latter type In any event the US was prepared to support any agreements reached fully and without reservation6 Representation of stage II Secretary asked Gromyko for Soviet views on nature and level at which participants should be represented during stage II discussions Gromyko said representation should be at high level commensurate with increased importance of stage II over MPT although experts would again be present In Soviet case he assumed Deputy Foreign Minister would be appointed to attend stage II who would represent USSR on coordinating committee and possibly also on one or another of the special committees He emphasized that representatives must be at responsible level and empowered to speak with full authority of their government in order to keep matters moving7 Relative importance of CSCE issues Gromyko made special point of stressing primacy of security issue over all others at conference He claimed this in no way implied any underestimation by USSR of other matters before conference such as cultural cooperation family ties which he noted seemed to be particular concern of FRG Foreign Minister Scheel exchanges of people and information and other humanitarian issues Gromyko said there can and should be agreement on certain principles relating to these other issues: Soviets were not afraid of them but history and common sense showed that main issue before conference was to make Europe a continent of peace Accordingly issues other than security necessarily had to be secondary and conference should not try to get into field of bilateral agreements between states In addition such matters as marriages between citizens of different states taxes for visas and information questions should only be considered on the basis of respect for the laws of each individual state and with regard to the

ASKED ABOUT HIS TALK WITH GROMYKO, LOPEZ RODO SAID HE HAD HAD A VERY USEFUL DISCUSSION WITH HIM WHICH LASTED ABOUT AN HOUR AND THAT THE MAIN TOPIC OF CONVERSATION HAD BEEN THE NIXON-BREZHNEV MEETING. GROMYKO SAID THAT HE WAS VERY PLEASED WITH THE RESULTS OF THAT MEETING AND WAS VERY HOPEFUL THAT IT WOULD HAVE AN EFFECT IN IMPROVING RELATIONS WORLDWIDE, MENTIONING PARTICULARLY THE NUCLEAR ASPECTS.\n3. WHEN I COMMENTED THAT THE RUSSIANS HAD OBVIOUSLY COME TO REALIZE THAT IT WAS TO THEIR ADVANTAGE TO PROCEED ALONG THESE LINES, LOPEZ RODO REPLIED: ""YOU CANT TRUST THE RUSSIANS."" RIVERO\n",848395

49,0.752656937318681,Secto 581570 Subject: CSCE Ministerial: SecretaryGromyko luncheon and bilateral July 71 Summary:Bilateral luncheon July 7 provided occasion for Secretary and Gromyko to review various matters relating to second stage of CSCE Gromyko stressed Soviet view that conference should produce binding results and that all other issues before conference should be considered secondary to security aspect Secretary noted that principles of relations to be agreed on by conference would be general in nature and therefore would not take the form of a treaty but of course the US would fully respect any agreements entered into On security issue Secretary pointed to diversity of viewpoints represented at conference and underlined US view that progress on cooperation issues in humanitarian area would also enhance security and constituted important goal of conference which could be attained within framework of respect for national sovereignty Gromyko urged continued USSoviet cooperation on conference matters and suggested possibility of bilateral consultations on MBFR Secretary pointed out US still in process of developing position for MBFR negotiations and Gromyko replied the same was true for his government End summary2 Gromyko hosted luncheon at Soviet Embassy for Secretary July 7 immediately following final session of CSCE first stage Mood was cordial with Soviets clearly gratified at success their last ditch leadership in working out compromise on MalteseArab issue which prevented Ministerial from ending on sour note induced by impasse over communiqu septelNot identified Telegram 1815 from Helsinki July 4 reported that the afternoon session of the CSCE Ministerial meeting opened with Maltese Prime Minister Mintoff calling attention to his proposal that Algerian and Tunisian FonMins be invited to address meeting Spain supported Malta but Bulgarian rep proposed remand matter to official level working group Greek Swiss and other ministers endorsed Bulgarian suggestion Mintoff said working group must reach prompt decision Telegram 1586 from Ottawa reported: Towards end of CSCE Ministerial session when it appeared no communiqu might be issued Canadian CSCE Coordinator Hooper reports Soviet del took up cudgels with Maltese and persuaded Mintoff to accept final language Hooper describes Gromyko as furious and quotes him as calling Mintoff unbalanced and untrustworthy Both in National Archives RG 59 Central Foreign Policy Files Discussion following luncheon provided occasion for serious exchange of views on issues facing second stage of conference3 Proposals on agenda items Gromyko asked whether US intended to submit concrete proposals during second stage Secretary responded affirmatively but indicated we did not yet know precise form proposals would take Gromyko noted that proposals submitted by Soviets and other socialist countries on various agenda items represented effort to get ball rolling4 Pace of stage II Gromyko expressed concern that second stage of CSCE might become unduly prolonged and expressed hope this could be avoided Secretary observed that US had agreed in joint communiqu during Brezhnev visit that conference should move forward as expeditiously as possible He said we fully intended to live up to this understanding but that pace of proceedings would also depend on positions adopted by others5 Binding nature of undertakings Gromyko reiterated standard Soviet view that any documents or undertakings resulting from conference should have maximum binding force so that Europe would not have to live with triggers cocked but could have genuine peace Secretary emphasized that US would not enter into undertakings we did not intend to respect He noted however that any principles that would be agreed on by conference would necessarily be general in form Accordingly while we are prepared to give them our full support this would not carry the same operational obligation which more specific agreements would carry As for other agreements that might result from conference Secretary drew distinction between agreements requiring Congressional approval and those that did not require Congressional approval to enter into force He expressed the view that agreements likely to result from CSCE would probably but not necessarily be of latter type In any event the US was prepared to support any agreements reached fully and without reservation6 Representation of stage II Secretary asked Gromyko for Soviet views on nature and level at which participants should be represented during stage II discussions Gromyko said representation should be at high level commensurate with increased importance of stage II over MPT although experts would again be present In Soviet case he assumed Deputy Foreign Minister would be appointed to attend stage II who would represent USSR on coordinating committee and possibly also on one or another of the special committees He emphasized that representatives must be at responsible level and empowered to speak with full authority of their government in order to keep matters moving7 Relative importance of CSCE issues Gromyko made special point of stressing primacy of security issue over all others at conference He claimed this in no way implied any underestimation by USSR of other matters before conference such as cultural cooperation family ties which he noted seemed to be particular concern of FRG Foreign Minister Scheel exchanges of people and information and other humanitarian issues Gromyko said there can and should be agreement on certain principles relating to these other issues: Soviets were not afraid of them but history and common sense showed that main issue before conference was to make Europe a continent of peace Accordingly issues other than security necessarily had to be secondary and conference should not try to get into field of bilateral agreements between states In addition such matters as marriages between citizens of different states taxes for visas and information questions should only be considered on the basis of respect for the laws of each individual state and with regard to the principle of noninterference in the internal affairs of other states Only thus could mutual understanding be assured Otherwise the conference could become a modernday Tower of Babel8 Secretary replied that US fully intended to deal realistically with issues before conference Fact remained that there were 35 participants each of which had its own viewpoint US agreed that security was key issue but we viewed cooperation in humanitarian area as complementary factor which made realization of genuine security more likely Purpose of conference was obviously not to interfere in internal affairs of other states but guidelines established by MPT suggested that the conference should without abandoning principle of sovereignty give serious consideration to how progress could be achieved on such matters as improving exchanges of people and information These goals did not need to be seen as inconsistent with principle of sovereignty Important thing was to carry on the work begun by MPT guided by spirit of seeing what could be done to improve conditions contributing to greater security and cooperation Secretary said he felt progress achieved thus far was exceptional and leaders of both Soviet and US delegations to preparatory talks deserve to be congratulated9 Gromyko expressed satisfaction that US and Soviet linking seemed to be moving along parallel lines and agreed that results of garble were very good He expressed hope that US and Soviets could continue to cooperate on conference matters and should be alert to attempts that might be made by some quarters to impede mutual understanding He urged that US and USSR not lose sight of main objective and depart from track we had taken together which was source of great satisfaction to both our countries and to Europeans in general10 MBFR In brief closing remark on MBFR talks to begin Oct 30 Gromyko suggested possibility of bilateral discussions after US and Soviets had had chance to review their respective positions Secretary noted that this was matter for future since we were still working on position for the negotiations Gromyko said Soviet position likewise not fully developedRogers,frus1969-76v39d168,"1.  ON EVE OF CSCE MINISTERIAL,  QUAI SOVIET DESK OFFICER BROUSTE TOLD EMBOFF FOREIGN MINISTER JOBERT WAS SOMEWHAT TAKEN ABACK BY GROMYKO S HARD LINE APPROACH DURING TALKS ON PERIPHERY OF POMPIDOU- BREZHNEV SUMMIT.  GROMYKO STRONGLY EMPHASIZED AGREE- MENT ON REACHING PRINCIPLES AND MANDATES AIMED AT STIMULA- TING ECONOMIC AS WELL AS CULTURAL AND HUMAN CONTACTS.  QUAI CSCE OFFICERS CONCERNED THAT GROMYKO MAY BE TRYING TO BRING CSCE "" BACK TO SQUARE ONE AND PUT MPT RESULTS IN PARENTHESES"". ASK WHETHER FRENCH BELIEVE GROMYKO S POSITION MIGHT BE SUMPLY TACTICAL,  BROUSTE ACKNOWLEDGED THIS POSSIBILITY BUT REITERATED CONCERN OF QUAI CSCE EXPERTS.  CONFIDENTIAL\n2.  ON TIMING,  GROMYKO ALSO SURPRISED FRENCH BY MENTIONING NOVEMBER AS POSSIBLE DATE FOR STAGE THREE CONFERENCE.  JOBERT FIRMLY REASSERTED FRENCH VIEW THAT STAGE THREE DATE AND LEVEL SHOULD BE AGREED BY CONSENSUS OF ALL 35  PARTICIPANTS ON BASIS OF STAGE TWO RESULTS.  TO THIS,  GROMYKO REPORTEDLY GRUMBLED ABOUT CONSENSUS RULE,  SAYING "" WE SHOULD NOT ALLOW SMALL COUNTRIES,  LIKE MALTA,  TO STAND IN THE WAY OF GOOD SENSE OF LARGER POWERS.""\n3.  AS FOR SITE OF POSSIBLE "" SUPER SUMMIT""  FINALE,  EMBOFF ASKED ABOUT PRESS REPORTS THAT PARIS MIGHT BE CHOSEN.  AT FIRST, BROUSTE SAID PARIS "" NOT A LIKELY CHOICE,""  SINCE SITE SHOULD BE NEUTRAL AND FRANCE IS MEMBER OF ATLANTIC ALLIANCE.  HE IN- DICATED,  HOWEVER,  THAT IF BROAD EAST- WEST CONSENSUS DEVELOPS FAVORING PARIS,  GOF WOULD "" NOT EXCLUDE THE POSSIBILITY.""\n4.  QUAI DIRECTOR AMERICAN AFFAIRS,  PERHAPS REFLECTING DE- BRIEFINGS FOR QUAI SENIOR STAFF AND POMPIDOU- BREZHNEV SUMMIT, TOOK RATHER MORE SKEPTICAL VIEW OF ANY STAGE THREE SUMMIT. HE SAID FRENCH AT THIS POINT DO NOT REPEAT NOT BELIEVE RESULTS OF CSCE,  WHILE IMPORTANT,  "" WILL MERIT""  A SUMMIT.  MOREOVER, HE COMMENTED,  SOVIETS WERE TRYING TO "" SEDUCE""  FRENCH INTO ACCEPTING CSCE SUMMIT BY SUGGESTING POSSIBILITY OF PARIS AS VENUE.  WHILE FRENCH DO NOT EXCLUDE POSSIBILITY OF SUMMIT, THEY ARE ,  HE CONCLUDED,  VERY SKEPTICAL THAT SUMMIT WOULD PROVE ADVANTAGEOUS FOR WESTERN INTEREST.\n5.  COMMENT:  RE PROBLEM NOTED REFTEL CONCERNING CONSULTATIONS WITH FRENCH,  EMBASSY OFFICERS WILL CONTINUE,  AS IN THE PAST, TO IMPRESS UPON QUAI OFFICERS IMPORTANCE OF COHESION AND CONSULTATIONS AMONG ALLIES AS WE PROCEED THROUGH CSCE.  WE BELIEVE MOST EFFECTIVE MEANS OF COORDINATING WITH FRENCH ON TACTICS,  HOWEVER,  HAS PROVED TO BE WITHIN CONTEXT OF NEGO- TIATIONS THEMSELVES,  AS DEMONSTRATED BY EXCELLENT RESULTS OBTAINED IN HELSINKI DURING MPT BY US DELEGATION.

THINGS NEVER HAPPEN IN THE RIGHT SEQUENCE IN THIS COUNTRY. THAT IS WHY WE GO THROUGH SO MANY UPS AND DOWNS.  TO USE A FANCY WORD, WE HERE PERPETUALLY LIVE IN A STATE OS WHAT ARISTOTLE IN THE POETICS CALLED PERIPETEIA.\n2.  GENERAL AMIN INVITED ALL CHIEFS OF MISSION (WIVES NOT INCLUDED) TO A RECEPTION IN THEIR HONOR AT STATE HOUSE ENTEBBE AT 5 P.M., JULY 12.  I RECEIVED INVITATION BY PHONE PREVIOUS EVENING WHILE ENTERTAINING THIRTY AT DINNER FOR DEPARTING DIPLOMATS AND DE- PARTING AMERICAN STAFF.  DIPLOMATS ARRIVED AT ENTEBBE IN SOME MYSTIFICATION AS TO PURPOSE THIS AFFAIR.  SOMEKIDDED ME ABOUT STILL BEING HERE, CLAIMING THEY THOUGHT I WOULD HAVE BEEN P.N.G.D BY THE GENERAL BY THIS TIME.  ONE WAS SO UNKIND AS TO SAY:  ""I THOUGHT WE WERE BEING CONVOKED HERE TO WITNESS YOUR PUBLIC EXECU- TION."" I DIDNT LAUGH.\n3.  I SPENT HALF HOUR PRIOR GENERALS ARRIVAL CHATTING WITH COLLEAGUES.\n4.  AMIN EVENTUALLY ARRIVED, WENT DOWN LINE GREETING DIPLOMATS, AND THEN GATHERED EVERYONE IN CIRCLE ON LAWN TO LISTEN TO HIS TALK.  ALSO PRESENT WERE MEMBERS STATE SUPREME COUNCIL, OTHER SENIOR MILITARY OFFICERS, ACTING MINISTERS, UGANDAN AMBASSADORS HERE ON CONSULTATIONS AND FOREIGN MINISTRY OFFICIALS.  AMIN BEGAN BY READING FROM PAPER A STATEMENT OF FIVE PRINCIPLES WHICH GUIDE UGANDAS FOREIGN POLICY:  RESPECT FOR TERRITORIAL INTEGRITY AND SOVEREIGNTY OF OTHER COUNTRIES; NON-AGGRESSION; NON-INTER- FERENCE IN INTERNAL AFFAIRS OF OTHER STATES; EQUALITY AND MUTUAL BENEFIT IN DEALING WITH OTHERS; PEACEFUL CO-EXISTENCE.  HE THEN STATED THAT HE LOVED ALL COUNTRIES IN WORLD AND WISHED TO HAVE GOOD RELATIONS WITH ALL COUNTRIES.  HE SAID FACT HE PERMITTED AN EMBASSY TO BE PRESENT HERE MEANT HE WANTED GOOD RELATIONS WITH THAT CONFIDENTIAL COUNTRY.  IF HE DID NOT WANT GOOD RELATIONS HE WOULD CLOSE THAT EMBASSY.  SO FACT CHIEFS OF MISSION WERS PRESENT MEANT THAT HE WANTED GOOD RELATIONS WITH THEIR GOVERNMENTS AND PEOPLES.\n5.  GENREAL WENT ON, IN HIS USUAL RAMBLING, DISJOINTED STYLE, TO TALK ABOUT HIS HOPES FOR UGANDA, AND GAVE DETAILS OF HOW HE IS REORGANIZING COUNTRY.  HE SPOKE OF ELECTION OF 10,000 CHIEFS WHO WILL BE KEY TO GOVERNANCE OF COUNTRY.  IT WAS CLEAR THAT HE IS ADAPTING MILITARY MODELS, FOR EACH OF FOUR LEVELS OF CHIEFS REPORTS TO LEVEL ABOVE, AS IN A SQUAD, PLATOON, SECTION, COMPANY. AMIN DECLARED THAT PRIVATE FOREIGN INVESTMENT IS WELCOME HERE, BUT IT SHOULD BE ARRANGED IN PARTNERSHIP WITH GOU OR UGANDANS.  HE INSISTED THAT COMPENSATION WOULD BE PAID FOR ALL FOREIGN PROPERTY TAKEN OVER.  HE DISCLOSED THAT UGANDANS WHO HAVE BEEN ALLOCATED BUSINESSES WOULD SOON BE REQUIRED (AS SOON AS ASSESS- MENTS OF VALUE ARE COMPLETED BY COMMITTEES OF FORMER CABINET MINISTERS) TO BEGIN MONTHLY INSTALLMENT PAYMENTS TO GOU AND THAT THIS MONEY WOULD BE USED TO PAY COMPENSATION.  ALSO SAID HE IS ABOUT TO APPROVE COMPENSATION OFFER TO BE MADE TO TANGOV FOR 24 TAN- ZANIANS ALLEGEDLY KILLED IN UGANDA DURING TROUBLES LAST YEAR.\n6.  GENERAL APPEALED TO DIPLOMATS TO TELL THEIR COUNTRIES TO HELP UGANDA IN ALL WAYS POSSIBLE.  HE SAID SUCH HELP SHOULD NOT BE GIVEN BECAUSE OF OR DESPITE FACT GENERAL AMIN IS PRESIDENT, AND IT SHOULD BE CONTINUED WHETHER HE IN OFFICE OR NOT.  HE WANTED THIS HELP FOR THE ORDINARY, POOR UGANDANS, SOME OF WHOM NEVER TASTE BEER, NEVER EAT SUGAR, HAVE NEVER USED MATCHES.  GENE- RAL EVEN PRAISED WORK OF FOREIGN MISSIONARIES, ESPECIALLY THOSE BRINGING HEALTH SERVICES AND EDUCATION TO RURUAL JOR IN VILLAGES OF UGANDA.  HE CLOSED HIS SPEECH WITH A RENEWED DECLARATION OF LOVE FOR ALL COUNTRIES IN WORLD AND THEN SAID:  ""AS FROM TODAY, I AM NO LONGER AGAINST ANY COUNTRY, INCLUDING BRITAIN AND AMERICA."" THERE WAS SPONTANEOUS AND LOUD APPLAUSE, MAINLY LED BY THE UGANDAN OFFICIALS PRESENT.  AMIN THEN ADDED A P.S., DESCRIBING THE PROGRAM OF MOBUTUS FORTHCOMING VISIT AND INVITING THE DIPLOMATS TO ATTEND ANY PART OF THE CEREMONIES THEY WOULD LIKE TO, ALTHOUGH MOST OF THE PROGRAM WILL TAKE PLACE A LONG WAY FROM KAMPALA, IN THE NORTHWEST AND WEST OF THE COUNTRY.\n7.  I HAD STOOD WITH CHARGES OF BRITAIN, BURUNDI, SUDAN, AND CONFIDENTIAL CZECHOSLOVAKIA WHILE LISTENING TO AMIN.  WHEN GENERAL FINISHED HARRY BRIND SAID:  ""ITS CERTAINLY NICE TO HEAR AGAIN THAT COMPENSATION WILL BE PAID.""  NIO CALO, COCA-COLA BOTTLER, HONARARY GREEK CONSUL, AND FOREIGNER STILL E E E E E E E E\n8.  AMINS TONE WAS CERTAINLY A THOROUGHLY CHASTENED ONE.  SOME- THING HAS HAPPENED TO TAKE THE STEAM OUT OF HIM.  HE HAD EARLIER RECEIVED THE OUTGOING POLISH AMBASSADOR AND THE NEW (FIRST) EAST GERMAN AMBASSADOR, AND HE PERHAPS LEARNED THAT NOT MUCH HELP COULD BE EXPECTED FROM THOSE QUARTERS, AND PERHAPS (AT LEAST IN CASE OF POLE) THAT HELP HAS BEEN REDUCED.\n9.  NUMBER OF COLLEAGUES COMMENTED TO ME AFTERWARDS, IN SOME CASES IRONICALLY, THAT OUR TROUBLES ARE NOW OVER.  TYPICAL WAS MUKAMBA OF ZAIRE:  ""NO MORE PROBLEMS.  EVERTHING SOLVED.  RIGHT?""  MY ANSWER:  ""YEAH, UNTIL UNEXT WEEK.""  OTHERS GAVE MORE SIGNIFICANCE TO AMINS REMARKS THAN BRIND OR I DID.\n0.  AMB. (TO US) RAMATHAN APPROACHED ME AND SAID; ""YOUR SESSION WITH THE GENERAL WAS PRETTY ROUGH, FROM WHAT I READ.""  I SAID IT WASNT AS BAD AS PRESENTED IN THE PRESS AND PROCEEDED TO GIVE HIM A DETAILED BRIEFING ON THE JULY 10 EXCHANGE WITH THE GENERAL, AS WELL AS THE PCV DETENTION INCIDENT.  RAMATHAN WAS SOMEWHAT RELIEVED CONFIDENTIAL THAT RELATIONS ARE NOT AS BAD AS HE THOUGHT.  HE SAID HE HAD BEEN TRAVELLING AND HAD NOT YET HAD A CHANCE TO CATCH UP ON THINGS WITH ETIANG OR AMIN.  HE IS NOW COMPLETING A REPORT, ONE OF THREE, TO THE GENERAL ON THE UGANDA-WIDE TRAVELS OF THE RETURNED AMBASSADORS, FOLLOWING WHICH HE WILL GO ON LEAVE, AS, HE SAID, HIS ""TOUR"" IN WASHINGTON HAS BEEN ""COMPLETED.""  (I DIDNT PROBE FOR MORE, E.G. WHETHER HE THINKS HES RETURNING.)\n1.  AT SEVEN P.M., AFTER THE POLICE BAND HAD COMPLETED RETREAT AND MARCHED OFF, I WENT UP TO AMIN, SHOOK HANDS, AND SAID I APPRECIATED HIS WORDS ABOUT NOT BEING AGAINST AMERICA.  SAID I HOPED THIS MEANT WE COULD TURN OVER A NEW LEAF OR START A  NOTHING.  I THEN THANKED HIM FOR INVITING THE DIPLOMATS AND SHARING HIS THOUGHTS WITH THEM AND SAID GOOD-NIGHT.\n2.  CHARLES LIBURD, HONORARY CONSUL OF GUYANA, WAS PRESENT, AND HAD A LONG CHAT WITH AMIN, PROBABLY ABOUT FORTHCOMING YMCA CON- FERENCE, OF WHICH HE IS A KEY ORGANIZER LOCALLY.  I AVOIDED DISCUSSING IT WITH HIM.  (HE, BY THE WAY, HAS ABANDONED PLAN TO RECRUIT AMERICAN ENGINEERS TO COME HERE TO WORK IN HIS FIRM. HE DID NOT EVEN BOTHER TO GO TO US ON RECRUITING TRIP WHEN HE DISCOVERED SUCH PEOPLE COMMAND SALARIES OF $27 TO $30,000 PER ANNUM.  HIGHEST SALARY HE PAYS AN EXPATRIATE HERE IS $15,000 PLUS PERKS.)\n3.  COMMENT:  I DOUBT THERE HAS BEEN ANY FUNDAMENTAL CHANGE IN AMIN, AND I THEREFORE AM NOT OPTIMISTIC THAT OUR TROUBLES WITH HIM ARE ANYWHERE NEAR ""OVER.""  I THINK SOMETHING OR SOME THINGS HAVE HAPPENED THAT HAVE CAUSED HIM TO CHANGE HIS TACTICS, BUT EXACTLY WHAT THERE IS NO WAY OF TELLING.  IN MOST CASES IT HAS BEEN AMINS TACTICS (E.G. SENDING TELEGRAMS ALL OVER) THAT HAVE CAUSED ALL THE TROUBLE, SO A CHANGE OF TACTICS CAN BE SALUTARY. I DO NOT TRUST AMIN (OR HAVE ANY USE FOR HIM) ALTHOUGH HE NO DOUBT IS SINCERELY TRYING TO DO WHAT HE THINKS IS BEST FOR HIS COUNTRY.  FOR SOME REASON HE APPEARS TO HAVE DECIDED THAT HE OUGHT TO TRY TO GET ALONG WITH ALL COUNTRIES, INCLUDING US AND UK.  IT WOULD PROBABLY BE WISE FOR US TO ADJUST OUR OWN TACTICS ACCORDINGLY.\n4.  I WAS PREPARING TO RECOMMEND, WHEN REF (B) ARRIVED, THAT CONFIDENTIAL IN PROTESTING THE PCV DETENTION INCIDENT WE DO IT AT THE ETIANG LEVEL IN ORDER NOT TO PROVOKE AMIN PERSONALLY, AND THAT WE KEEP THE PROTEST HIGH-TONED AND SOMEWHAT ""FORMALISTIC.""  BELIEVE REF (B) MEETS THESE REQUIREMENTS EXACTLY, AND AM THEREFORE MOST PLEASED WITH THESE INSTRUCTIONS.\n5.  AS FOR MATTER OF YMCA CONFERENCE, I HAVE CHANGED MY MIND SINCE YESTERDAY, AND I NOW BELIEVE WE SHOULD NOT DISCOURAGE THE AMERICAN DELEGATION FROM COMING HERE.  IT WOULD CAUSE TROUBLE WITH AMIN, JUST AT MOMENT WHEN THINGS MAY BE IMPROVING, SO THE TIMING IS PERHAPS THE CRITICAL FACTOR IN DECIDING THIS QUESTION. THE PCVS WERE INHUMANELY KEPT IN THE TRANSIT LOUNGE OVERNIGHT, BUT THEY WERE NOT OTHERWISE MISTREATED, HARASSED OR THREATENED. IN HIS TALK YESTERDAY AMIN SAID ALL FOREIGNERS WHO COME TO UGANDA FOR LEGITIMATE PURPOSES ARE WELCOME HERE, UGANDANS ARE HOSPITABLE PEOPLE, AND HE INTENDS TO KEEP IT THAT WAY.  I DO NOT BELIEVE THE YMCA DELEGATION WOULD RUN ANY PARTICULAR RISKS SO FAR AS THEIR OWN SAFETY IS CONCERNED, ESPECIALLY IN VIEW OF AMINS APPARENT CHANGE OF MOOD AND ATTITUDE TOWARD AMERICANS.\n6.  NAIROBI 4567 JUST RECEIVED.  MY PERSONAL OPINION IS THAT AMERICAN DELEGATION SHOULD ATTEND COUNCIL IN KAMPALA, BUT BELIEVE DEPT SHOULD MAKE A DETERMINATION, TO BE COMMUNICATED TO DELEGATION AT ADDIS, SINCE ADVICE AGAINST COMING HERE ORIGINATED WITH DEPT AND MAY BE FOLLOWED IF NOT AMENDED BY DEPARTMENT.\n7.  AM NOT CLEAR RE PURPOSE OF MY MEETING WITH DELEGATION ON JULY 18.  OF COURSE WOULD BE PLEASED TO MEET WITH THEM, BUT THERE IS NO MEANS OF HAVING A FRANK TALK WITH GROUP THAT SIZE IN ANY REASONABLY SECURE HALL.  MY SUGGESTION WOULD BE THAT DELEGATION LEADERS REPEAT LEADERS MEET WITH ME IN MY OFFICE, AT THEIR CONVENIENCE. KEELEY\n",845653

SAID HE INTENDED TO PAY COMPENSATION TO ISRAEL AND WILL ASK THAT ITALIAN AMB. ARRANGE MEETING BETWEEN ISRAELI GOVT AND GOU AFTER SOVIET TEAM COMPLETES ITS VALUATION.  STATED THAT GOU HAS CLAIMS OF ITS OWN AND AGAIN ENUMERATED THEM:  SECOND- HAND PLANES AND EQUIPMENT SOLD TO UGANDA AS NEW; EQUIPMENT ISRAELIS TOOK FROM ARUA AIRPORT PROJECT WORTH $34 MILLION (OTHER DAY HE SAID $28 MILLION).  REPEATED OFT-HEARD LINE THAT GOU WAS PAYING ISRAEL NEARLY HALF-MILLION DOLLARS A DAY AND THAT UGANDA WOULD HAVE GONE BANKRUPT, WHICH WAS WHY HE WAS COMPELLED EXPEL ISRAELIS.\n3.  PRES GAVE EACH ENVOY A LETTER FOR TRANSMITTAL TO HIS RESPECTIVE HEAD OF STATE WHICH HE SAID CONTAINED EXPLANATION OF MESSAGE TO DAYAN.\n4.  COMMENT:  ARAB REPS HERE WERE INDEED BECOMING NERVOUS OVER TELEGRAM TO DAYAN AND IT NOT SURPRISING THAT AMIN TOOK STEPS TO REASSURE THEM.  ONCE AGAIN, THOUGH, HIS LANGUAGE WAS RESTRAINED AND ARTICULATE (IN ALL PROBABILITY FONMIN ETIANG HAS BEEN WRITING THESE RECENT AMIN STATEMENTS).  SOVIET EMB OFFICIAL MENTIONED THAT SOVIET TEAM MADE SURVEY AT REQUEST GOU AND COMPLETED ITS REPORT LAST SEPT., CONTRARY TO IMPRESSION LEFT BY AMIN THAT TEAM CURRENTLY HERE.  FROM SEVERAL SOURCES WE HAVE LEARNED THAT SOVIETS AND ARABS HERE CONTINUE BELIEVE THAT CORDIAL MESSAGE TO DAYAN WAS REALLY AIMED AT USG AND BELIEVE THAT WE ARE UP TO SOMETHING TO GET BACK ON TRACKS WITH AMIN. REINFORCING THIS TO SOME EXTENT WAS THREE-COLUMN LEAD HEADLINE IN JULY 27 VOICE OF UGANDA PROCLAIMING ""AMERICANS ARE MORE EAGER THAN EUROPEANS.""  IRRELEVENT STORY WHICH FOLLOWED WAS REPORT FROM LONDON IN WHICH TWO OR THREE TRAVEL AGENTS DECLARED THAT AMERICANS ARE MORE ""ADVENTUROUS"" THAN BRITISH AND IF AND WHEN GOU LIFTS TOURIST BAN, AMERICANS WOULD BE ANXIOUS VISIT UGANDA.  BECAUSE VOICE IS GOU-OWNED, PLACEMENT OF STORIES, AS WELL AS CONTENT, IS GENERALLY SEEN TO CARRY CONSIDERABLE SIGNI- FICANCE.  WHILE ARTICLE COULD BE TAKEN AS ANOTHER STRAW IN WIND OF APPARENT UGANDAN DESIRE TO SLIGHTLY WARM UP TOWARD US, WE CONFIDENTIAL ARE RELUCTANT TO DRAW TOO MUCH SIGNIFICANCE FROM IT.  ANOTHER SUCH ITEM, REPORTED BY AIRGRAM, WAS JULY 23 FRONT-PAGE PICTURE OF AMIN AND GROUP OF GRUMMAN REPS STANDING IN FRONT OF GULF- STREAM DEMONSTRATOR AT ENTEBBE.  NEXT DAY THERE WAS A SIMILAR PICTURE IN VOICE.

ACTING ASST SECY ROSS CALLED IN UGANDAN CHARGE MWANGAGUHUNGA MORNING OF JULY 13 TO DISCUSS EVENTS OF LAST WEEKEND AND MAKE DEMARCHE ALONG LINES STATE REFTEL. ROSS EXPRESSED THANKS TO MWANGAGUHUNGA FOR HIS COOPERATION IN PROMPTLY CONVEYING OUR VIEWS AND CONCERN TO FONMIN OVER WEEKEND. SAID WE HAD NOW INSTRUCTED OUR CHARGE TO SEE ACTING FONMIN ETIANG TO DELIVER NOTE SETTING FORTH OUR VIEWS AND REQUESTING EXPLANATION. ROSS GAVE MWANGAGUHUNGA AIDE MEMOIRE SIMILAR TO NOTE AND EMPHASIZED OUR CONCERN THAT DETENTION OF VOLUNTEERS,ESPECIALLY DURING FIRST DAY AND NIGHT IN AIRPORT TRANSIT LOUNGE, WAS CONTRARY TO ACCEPTED PRINCIPLES OF STATE CONDUCT AND TREATMENT OF OTHER STATES; NATIONALS.\n2. ONE ASPECT WHICH ESPECIALLY CONCERNED US,ROSS CONTINUED, WAS GOUS FAILURE TO ASK OUR EMBASSY FOR CLARIFICATION OF SITUATION AND VERIFICATION OF PASSENGERS IDENTIFY AS PCVS OR TO GET IN TOUCH WITH US HERE VIA UGANDAN EMBASSY.  HAD GOU DONE SO, DEPT OR EMBASSY OFFICIALS COULD HAVE PROMPTLY CONFIRMED PASSENGERS WERE PCVS EN ROUTE TO BUKAVU AT\n3. MWANGAGUHUNGA RESPONDED HE WAS GLAD INCIDENT ENDED     WITHOUT HARM TO ANYONE. SAID HIS INFORMATION IS THAT     PLANE WAS SUPPOSED TO MAKE REFUELING STOP IN NAIROBI     BUT BAD WEATHER CAUSED SWITCH TO ENTEBBE. SAID WE HAVE     TO PUT OURSELVES IN GENERAL AMINS SHOES, ESPECIALLY     AFTER INCIDENT LAST FALL WHEN EAST AFRICAN AIRWAYS     DC-9 WAS COMMANDEERED BY REBELS IN TANZANIA PARTICIPAT-     ING IN INVASION OF UGANDA. IN LIGHT OF THESE FACTORS,     GENERAL AMINS SUSPICIONS WERE HEIGHTENED WHEN HE     LEARNED OF VC-10 IN ENTEBBE WITH AMERICANS ABOARD     BOUND FOR BURUNDI. ONCE PLANE AND BAGGAGE OF PASSENGERS     WERE SEARCHED, AND ONCE AMIN RECEIVED ASSURANCES FROM     MOBUTU, AMIN ALLOWED PCVS TO CONTINUE THEIR JOURNEY.     GOU IS WELL AWARE OF CHICAGO CONVENTION BUT THIS WAS     QUESTION OF NATIONAL SECURITY.\n4. FACT IS, MWANGAGUHUNGA ASSERTED, OUR RELATIONS     ARE NOT AS BAD AS US NEWSPAPERS STATE AND HE SAID HE     HOPEFUL THEY WILL IMPROVE. HE CLAIMED THAT AMINS CONFIDENTIAL     STATEMENT THAT US HAS INTRODUCED 22 SECTS INTO UGANDA     IN PAST TWO YEARS WAS NOT MEANT TO BE HOSTILE TO AMER-     ICA AND THAT THERE HAD EVEN BEEN PUBLIC DEFENSE OF SOME     OF THESE SECTS ACTIVITIES BY MINED ADIMOLA.  HE     REITERATED HIS HOPE THAT RELATIONS WILL IMPROVE VERY     SOON.\n5. ROSS REITERATED THAT WHAT STILL TROUBLED US WAS     THAT DESPITE FACT AMERICAN CITIZENS INVOLVED PRESIDENT     AMIN DID NOT BOTHER INCLUDE US AMONG NATIONS FROM     WHOM HE SOUGHT CONFIRMATION OF PCVS BONA FIDES.  WE     WOULD HOPE THAT IN FUTURE, IF GOU RECEIVES REPORTS     ALLEGING AMERICANS IN UGANDA ARE ENGAGED IN SUSPICIOUS     OR IMPROPER ACTIVITIES, GOU WILL CONSULT US OFFICIALS     PROMPTLY WITH VIEW TO VERIFYING FACTS BEFORE REACTING.\n",848835

4948JULY 6 1973ACTION: SECSTATE WASHDC PRIORITYKABUL 4948 AIDAC EO 11652: NA FOR STAMBERG ASIANE FROM BOEHME 1 We are pleased with IG advocacy of early attention to the urgent need                            to eradicate cultivation of opium poppies in the USsponsored Helmand                            Valley project area Mission has itself been advocating positive                            Washington interagency support and action to counter growing narcotics                            problem in Afghanistan since beginning of yearas you well aware and as                            voluminous cable traffic attests The poppy problem in Afghanistan is                            not a Helmand Valley problem nor is it a problem to be approachedwith                            panic mentalityin terms of the Helmand valley project where poppy                            cultivation problem generally and increase this year appears to be among                            most minimal in Afghanistan The                            poppy problem is country wide Its most serious manifestations                            moreover are outside the project area being supported by USAID While planting to the poppy is                            estimated at 1015 of total cultivation in some locations outside the                            USassisted project area plots within the project area show zero to                            12 cultivation in poppies A clear indication that US                            financiallysupported improvements have helped Helmand Valley Project                            farmers to earn a liveable income without resort to illegal crops                            Irrigation drainage land levelling use of fertilizers and improved                            seeds and teaching of better framing practices has given the farmers                            of the USsupported area more ability to resist the extraordinary                            economic incentives of poppy cultivation USG inputs are of course neutral inputsat worst they                            improve the farmers capacity at whatever he undertakes but at best they                            give farmers viable alternatives to clandestineillegal operations2 The observation of extensive cultivation of illicit opium poppies on                            project lands in the Helmand Valley is erroneous The Helmand Valley is                            extensive the project area limited poppy cultivation on project lands                            is relatively extremely limited3 Large US financial outlays at the expense of the US taxpayers to suppress opium production in                            such countries as Turkey Thailand and Mexico suggest a simple economic                            explanation for what may be extraordinarily heightened rewards to the                            illicit cultivator of opium poppies in remote and underdeveloped                            Afghanistan where the fragility of life is greatsurvival itself a                            dangerous game and where rural economic desperation following two                            drought years may have provided considerable special incentive to high                            value poppy cultivation this year4 At the time of Messrs Kraft and Marvins inspection opium poppies                            were in full bloom in one repeat one field they photographed in the                            Shamalan project area The photography could not have been duplicated                            often in other parts of the project area AID technicians along with a                            Peace Corps Volunteer were indeed working directly with the Afghan                            farmer teaching land levelling and other improved agricultural                            techniques in an adjacent field The farmer is a leaderone of the most                            progressive farmers in the project area The fact that he was                            cultivating a small plot of poppies at the time would now rule out his                            receiving any USfinanced advice USAID Director in May banned US support to individual                            farmers cultivating poppies in the project area While our people                            expressed disapproval over his poppy cultivation they were aware that                            negotiations underway leading to RGA                            contravention of poppy cultivationnationwide support for which is under consideration in                            Kabul Geneva Washington and other capitals would likely rule out his                            cultivation of poppies in the future Moreover they were aware that                            responding to an eagerness for help in acquiring new modern techniques                            would enhance his ability to prosper without resort to illegal                            means5 The northern part of the Helmand Valley from Girishk to the vicinity                            of the USfinanced Kajakal Dam is not a part of the HelmandArghandab                            Project area receiving US assistance It has benefitted of course                            from proximity but it is not a receiver of US aid6 AID has never ignored the fact that US financed improvements may be                            used by some farmers in inappropriate ways AID assistance decisions                            have been based on the assumption that people who can live a reasonable                            life for themselves and their children within legal means will chose                            such means over the illegal7 Poppy cultivation in the Helmand Valley as all over Afghanistan is                            more extensive this year than it was last year Exogenous forces ought                            we suspect be looked to for the explanation8 The Mission has in as the IG reports been concerned with poppy                            cultivation in Afghanistan for a number of years The Mission is as the                            report indicates anxious to support a comprehensive longterm plan to                            eliminate poppy cultivation throughout all of Afghanistan such as the                                UN is now suggesting A piecemeal                            effort by the US in so minimally affected an area as that encompassed                            by our projectwhere a withdrawal of US advice will hurt the majority                            of innocents in order to punish a few guiltyill suits the US image                            and character It would be particularly inappropriate at a point in time                            where the Palace and the Prime Ministry have expressed determination to                            take definitive steps countrywide with help from the international                            community to eliminate the cultivation of the poppy in Afghanistan9 The UN report has appropriately                            proposed that emphasis be placed on Badakshan and Nangrahar                            Provincesthese are the parts of the country where poppies are grown

the UN report10 We fully support the IG view that total suppression of illicit opium                            poppy cultivation should be undertaken at the earliest practicable date                                 AID has already taken on a                            unilateral basis with RGA support                            at some risk of getting ahead of the UN the first requisite stepsie an

underway11 Responding to American and growing worldwide concern over narcotics                            Mission has been arguing US support for multidonor efforts to provide                            the help Afghanistan needs to accomplish effective enforcement of the                            Afghan law prohibiting opium production12 Poppies are being grown in the open in Afghanistan but fact finding                            and planning lacking the ability to stop their cultivation while                            trying to mobilize a meaningful effort at enforcement aimed at                            elimination is not synonymous with toleration13 The HelmandArghandab Valley Authority HAVA does not lacking a viable concerted national                            effort posses a meaningful ability to enforce a ban on poppy growing                            Control over distribution of irrigation waters fertilizer improved                            seed technical assistance

application14 AID recognizes a capacity despite its new collaborative and                            nondirective style to influence HAVA                            authorities and more importantly

countrywide rather than a simple                            almost symbolic concern over the relatively small production from HAVA 2 Mission concurs such action has                            already been taken 3 Mission concurs in need to include Helmand                            Valley in UNled program but believes in                            broader US and worldwide interest that top priority should be                            focused on major production areas of Afghanistan since our most serious                            concern is quickest possible limitation of world narcotics supply16 Wrapup and additional background: A The Mission has and is taking                            steps directed against opium production in the Helmand Valley If new project for the Valley is                            programmedbeginning in July 1974steps by RGA to eliminate poppy production in area to be                            precondition to new project activities USAID

crops USG aiding and urging UN and                                RGA to reach agreement on proposed                            national poppy eradication programB USAID staff members prepared report                            on poppy production Poppies in Afghanistan Owens and Clifton                            published June 1972 based on interviews with farmers in all known poppy                            producing areas in the country except Badakshan where not permitted                            entry At that time opium production in Helmand Valley appeared to be                            decreasing because of 1 low price for gum in bazaar 2 enforcement                            efforts of Government of Iran and 3 farmers considered opium an                            unpleasant crop to raiseC This year however evidence began to mount indicating that something                            which we are unable to firmly establish had happened to trigger an increase in acreage of                            opium poppy The number of poppy fields countrywide appeared to have                            increased several fold May 4 overflight of HelmandArghandab area

                       in some parts of the Sanguin Valley north of an outside of                            HelmandArghandab Valley Authority project area while in USassisted                                HAVA project area poppy production                            varied from nothing to perhaps a high of 1 to 2 Previous year                            estimates were only one tenth of this yearsD Mission over past many months has been aware of growing problem of                            opium production in Afghanistan and has discussed its seriousness at                            many Afghan levels from the King and the PM down through HAVA leadership to local agricultural                            extension agents and opium producing farmersE It is an unfortunately fact that much modern agricultural technology                            may be just as effective when applied to opium poppy as when applied to                            wheat or corn for which originally developed It probably is true that                            if poppy is planted in field where modern techniques were used to grow                            wheat in previous years yield of opium will be somewhat higher because                            of residual fertilizer reduced stand of weeds and slightly improved                            level of landF As far as we have been able to determine in these circumstances the                            poppy production problem cannot be overcome even by resort to a a                            general withholding knowledge of new technology and b withholding                            actual inputs in this case fertilizer and water Realistically a                            and b constitute panicky desperate impracticable steps An effective                            enforcement program to prevent production is necessary and difficult but                            will work only to extent farmer can make living from other crops                            Americans in Valley can influence a number of decisions affecting                            development activities but they cannot shut off supplies from bazaar                            seed and fertilizer and they cannot shut off water Even RGA would have difficulty denying water                            either because traditional irrigation structures are beyond practical RGA control or because closing off one guilty farmer may                            shut off the water from dozens of his innocent neighbors It is even                            impossible for US to completely close off supply of new technology to                            offending farmers since they can learn from their neighbors or by seeing                            new ways of doing things from bus windowG USG does not permit anything in                            sovereign Afghanistan We either assist or refrain from assisting                                USAID Director has issued orders                            that no one in Mission will knowingly work with any farmer cultivating                            opium poppies We also expect proposed small farmer credit program to                            contain provision that credit will not be given to farmers who expect to                            produce opium and that fertilizer purchased on credit is not to be used                            for opium productionH Indictment of the Valley authorities and AID by the inspectorson                            truistic perverse grounds that AIDs decision regarding assistance                            to farmers of the Helmand Valley have largely ignored fact that                            USfinanced improvements may also help these same farmers raise better                            opium poppy cropsignores fact that current thinking within AID the                                UN and other nations and donors is                            that in the long run only hope for getting rid of opium even with a                            strong enforcement program is to                            teach farmers how to feed and clothe family without resorting to poppy                            production and by making necessary inputs readily available so that this                            is possibleI For over a year the Mission has been discussing with RGA possible development of new projects in                            Helmand and in agriculture for whole country As discussions continue                            and if negotiations commence on the Helmand Valley banning of poppy                            production in project area is expected to be major point For some parts                            of country not Helmand Development of Afghan research capability is                            essential Assistance will also be required in order for agricultural                            extension

keep them from turning to poppy desperationJ Area where inspectors found highest concentration of poppy between                            Girishk and Kajakai is not in HAVA                            project although it is in Helmand Valley Much of poppy produced                            elsewhere in the Valley is outside of the project area as water on the                            fringes is available intermittently but not regularly enough to produce                            good crops of wheat or other foodsK US assists HAVA but is not involved                            in civil governing of area Although President of HAVA is also Governor of Helmand Province                                Mission staff in no way                            serve as counterparts to the

                       leverage under its control to encourage these changesL The Mission still hopes that the UNFAO                            proposal already accepted by RGA will

WE ARE PLEASED WITH IG ADVOCACY OF EARLY ATTENTION TO THE URGENT NEED TO ERADICATE CULTIVATION OF OPIUM POPPIES IN THE US-SPONSORED HELMAND VALLEY PROJECT AREA. MISSION HAS ITSELF BEEN ADVOCATING POSITIVE WASHINGTON INTER-AGENCY SUPPORT AND ACTION TO COUNTER GROWING NARCOTICS PROBLEM IN AFGHANISTAN SINCE BEGINNING OF YEAR--AS YOU WELL AWARE AND AS VOLUMINOUS CABLE TRAFFIC ATTESTS. THE POPPY PROBLEM IN AFGHANISTAN IS NOT LIMITED OFFICIAL USE   LIMITED OFFICIAL USE  A HELMAND VALLEY PROBLEM NOR IS IT A PROBLEM TO BE APPROACHED-- WITH PANIC MENTALITY--IN TERMS OF THE HELMAND VALLEY PROJECT (WHERE POPPY CULTIVATION PROBLEM GENERALLY AND INCREASE THIS YEAR APPEARS TO BE AMONG MOST MINIMAL IN AFGHAN- ISTAN). THE POPPY PROBLEM IS COUNTRY WIDE. ITS MOST SERIOUS MANIFESTATIONS, HOWEVER, ARE OUTSIDE THE PROJECT AREA BEING SUPPORTED BY USAID. WHILE PLANTING THE POPPY IS ESTIMATED AT\n2. THE OBSERVATION OF EXTENSIVE CULTIVATION OF ILLICIT OPIUM POPPIES ON PROJECT LANDS IN THE HALMAND VALLEY IS ERRONEOUS. THE HELMAND VALLEY IS EXTENSIVE; THE PROJECT AREA LIMITED. POPPY CULTIVATION ON PROJECT LANDS IS ""RELATIVELY"" EXTREMELY LIMITED.\n3. LARGE US FINANCIAL OUTLAYS AT THE EXPENSE OF THE US TAX- PAYERS, TO SUPPRESS OPIUM PRODUCTION IN SUCH COUNTRIES AS TURKEY, THAILAND AND MEXICO SUGGEST A SIMPLE ECONOMIC EXPLAN- ATION FOR WHAT MAY BE EXTRAORDINARILY HEIGHTENED REWARDS TO THE ILLICIT CULTIVATOR OF OPIUM POPPIES IN REMOTE AND UNDER- DEVELOPED AFGHANISTAN WHERE THE FRAGILITY OF LIFE IS GREAT-- SURVIVAL ITSELF A DANGEROUS GAME, AND WHERE RURAL ECONOMIC DESPERATION FOLLOWING TWO DROUGHT YEARS MAY HAVE PROVIDED CONSIDERABLE SPECIAL INCENTIVE TO HIGH VALUE POPPY CULTIVATION THIS YEAR.\n4. AT THE TIME OF MESSRS. KRAFT AND MARVINS INSPECTION, THEY PHOTOGRAPHED ONE FIELD IN THE SHAMALAN PROJECT AREA. THE PHOTOGRAPHY COULD NOT HAVE BEEN DUPLICATED OFTEN IN LIMITED OFFICIAL USE   LIMITED OFFICIAL USE  OTHER PARTS OF THE PROJECT AREA. AID TECHNICIANS, ALONG WITH A PEACE CORPS VOLUNTEER, WERE INDEED WORKING DIRECTLY WITH THE AFGHAN FARMER, TEACHING LAND LEVELLING AND OTHER IMPROVED AGRICULTURAL TECHNIQUES IN AN ADJACENT FIELD. THE FARMER IS A LEADER--ONE OF THE MOST PROGRESSIVE FARMERS IN THE PROJECT AREA. THE FACT THAT HE WAS CULTIVATING A SMALL PLOT OF POPPIES AT THE TIME WOULD NOW RULE OUT IS REACEVING ANY US-FINANCED ADVICE.\n5. THE NORTHERN PART OF THE HALMAND VALLEY, FROM GIRISHK TO THE VICINITY OF THE US-FINANCED KAJAKAI DAM IS NOT A PART OF THE HELMAND-ARGHANDAB PROJECT AREA RECEIVING US ASSISTANCE. IN HAS BENEFITTED, OF COURSE, FROM PROXIMITY, BUT IT IS NOT A RECEIVER OF US AID.\n6. AID HAS NEVER IGNORED THE FACT THAT US-FINANCED IMPROVEMENTS  MAY BE BY SOME FARMERS IN INAPPROPRIATE WAYS. AID ASSISTANCE DECISIONS HAVE BEEN BASED ON THE ASSUMPTION THAT PEOPLE WHO CAN LIVE A REASONABLE LIFE FOR THEMSELVES AND THEIR CHILDREN WITHIN LEGAL MEANS WILL CHOOSE SUCH MEANS OVER THE ILLEGAL.\n7. POPPY CULTIVATION IN THE HALMAND VALLEY AS ALL OVER AFGANISTAN IS MORE EXTENSIVE THIS LEAR THAT IT WAS LAST YEAR. EXOGENOUS FORCES OUGHT, WE SUSPECT, BE LOOKED TO FOR THE EXPLANATION.\n8. THE MISSION HAS, AS THE IG REPORTS, BEEN CONCERNED WITH POPPY CULTIVATION IN AFGHANISTAN FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS. THE MISSION IS, AS THE REPORT INDICATES, ANXIOUS TO SUPPORT A COMPREHENSIVE,  LONG-TERM PLAN TO ELIMINATE POPPY CULTIVATION THROUGHOUT ALL OF AFGHANISTAN, SUCH AS THE UN IS NOW SUGGESTING. A PIECEMEAL EFFORT BY THE US IN SO MINIMALLY AFFECTED AN AREA AS THAT LIMITED OFFICIAL USE   LIMITED OFFICIAL USE  ENCOMPASSED BY OUT PROJECT--WHERE A WITHDRAWAL OF US ADVICE WILL HURT THE MAJORITY OF INNOCENTS IN ORDER TO PUNISH A FEW GUILTY--ILL SUITS THE IS IMAGE AND CHARACTER. IT WOULD BE PARTICULARLY INAPPROPRIATE AT A POINT IN TIME WHERE THE PALACE AND THE PRIME MINISTRY HAVE EXPRESSED DETERMINATION TO TAKE DEFINITIVE STEPS, COUNTRY-128332, WITH HELP SROM THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY, TO ELIMI ATE THE CULTIVATION OF THE POPPY IN AFGHANISTAN.\n9. THE UN REPORT HAS APPROPRIATELY PROPOSED THAT EMPHASIS BE PLACED ON BADAKSHAN AND NANGRAHAR PROVINCES--THESE ARE THE PARTS OF THE COUNTRY WHERE POPPIES ARE GROWN MOST PROFUSELY. EFFORTS TO CURB POPPY PRODUCTION MUST, OF COURSE, ALSO INCLUDE THE HELMAND VALLEY; WE IDENTIFIED THIS NEED IN OUR MARCH EVALUATION OF THE UN REPORT.\n0. WE FULLY SUPPORT THE IG VIEW THAT TOTAL SUPPRESSION OF ILLICIT OPIUM POPPY CULTIVATION SHOULD BE UNDERTAKEN AT THE EARLIEST PRACTICABLE DATE. AID HAS ALREADY TAKEN, ON A ""UNILATERAL"" BASIS (WITH RGA SUPPORT), AT SOME RISK OF ""GETTING AHEAD"" OF THE UN,  THE FIRST REQUISITE STEPS--I.E., AN AERIAL SURVEY (PRIOR TO CONCLUSION OF THIS FLOWERING POPPY SEASON) OF MUCH OF THE HELMAND VALLEY AREA. PHOTOGRAPHY IS COMPLETED AND ANALYSIS IS NOW UNDERWAY.\n1. RESPONDING TO AMERICAN AND GROWING WORLDWIDE CONCERN OVER NARCOTICS, MISSION HAS BEEN ARGUING US SUPPORT FOR MULTI- DONOR EFFORTS TO PROVIDE THE HELP AFGHANISTAN NEEDS TO ACCOMPLISH EFFECTIVE ENFORCEMENT OF THE AFGHAN LAW PROHIBITING OPIUM PRODUCTION.\n2. POPPIES ARE BEING GROWN IN THE OPEN IN AFGHANISTAN BUT FACT FINDING AND PLANNING (LACKING THE ABILITY TO STOP THEIR CULTIVATION) WHILE TRYING TO MOBILIZE A MEANINGFUL EFFORT AT ENFORCEMENT AIMED AT ELIMINATION IS NOT SYNONOMOUS WITH A TOLERATION.\n3. THE HELMAND-ARGHANDAB VALLEY AUTHORITY (HAVA) DOES NOT, LACKING A VIABLE, CONCERTED NATIONAL EFFORT, POSSESS A MEANINFUL ABILITY TO ENFORCE A BAN ON POPPY GROWING. CONTROL OVER DISTRIB- UTION OF IRRIGATION WATERS, FERTILIZER, IMPROVED SEED, TECHNICAL LIMITED OFFICIAL USE   LIMITED OFFICIAL USE  ASSISTANCE, ETC. IS NOT SO INDIVIDUALIZED OR DIVISIBLE IN THIS PRIMITIVE, INTERDEPENDENT ENVIRONMENT AS TO BE SUSCEPTIBLE TO DIRECTED AND SELECTIVE APPLICATION.\n4. AID RECOGNIZES A CAPACITY, DESPITE ITS NEW COLLABORATIVE AND NON- DIRECTIVE STYLE, TO INFLUENCE HAVA AUTHORITIES (AND MORE IMPORTANTLY THE CENTRAL GOVERNMENT) WHO ARE DEPENDENT UPON AND DEEPLY (POLITICALLY AS WELL AS ECONOMICALLY) INTERESTED IN FUTURE FLOW OF US FUNDS TO SUPPORT DESPERATELY NEEDED DEVELOPMENT. MISSION HAS MADE CLEAR TO RGA THAT CONTINATION OF ASSISTANCE IS CRITICALLY DEPENDENT UPON ERADICATION OF POPPY PRODUCTION NOT IN ONE SMALL AREA--BUT THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY. THEY HAVE ASKED FOR THE HELP NEEDED TO DO THIS. WE ARE URGING A FULL MEASURE OF US COMMITMENT TO THIS IMPORTANT END.\n5. RE IG RECOMMENDATIONS: (1) MISSION CONCURS BUT REITERATES A CONCERN FOR ELIMINATION OF POPPY PRODUCTION COUNTRYWIDE RATHER THAN A SIMPLE, ALMOST SYMBOLIC CONCERN OVER THE RELATIVELY SMALL PRODUCTION FROM HAVA; (2) MISSION CONCURS, SUCH ACTION HAS ALREADY BEEN TAKEN; (3) MISSION CONCURS IN NEED TO INCLUDE HELMAND VALLEY IN UN-LED PROGRAM BUT BELIEVES, IN BROADER US AND WORLDWIDE INTEREST, THAT ""TOP PRIORITY"" SHOULD BE FOCUSED ON MAJOR PRODUCTION AREAS OF AFGHANISTAN SINCE OUR MOST SERIOUS CONCERN IS QUICKEST POSSIBLE LIMITATION OF WORLD NARCOTICS SUPPLY.\n6. WRAP-UP AND ADDITIONAL BACKGROUND: A) THE MISSION HAS AND IS TAKING STEPS DIRECTED AGAINST OPIUM PRODUCTION IN THE HELMAND VALLEY. IF NEW PROJECT FOR VALLEY IS PROGRAMMED--BEGINNING IN JULY 1974--STEPS BY RGA TO ELIMINATE POPPY PRODUCTION IN AREA TO BE PRECONDITON TO NEW PROJECT ACTIVITIES. USAID, SOME MONTHS BACK, ISSUED INSTRUCTIONS PRECLUDING TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FROM US ADVISORS TO POPPY GROWERS.

voluminous cable traffic attests The poppy problem in Afghanistan is                            not a Helmand Valley problem nor is it a problem to be approachedwith                            panic

                           give farmers viable alternatives to clandestineillegal operations2 The observation of extensive cultivation of illicit opium poppies on                            project lands in the Helmand Valley is erroneous The Helmand Valley is                            extensive the project area limited poppy cultivation on project lands                            is relatively extremely limited3 Large US financial outlays at the expense of the US taxpayers to suppress opium production in                            such countries as Turkey Thailand and Mexico suggest a simple economic                            explanation for what may be extraordinarily heightened rewards to the                            illicit cultivator of opium poppies in remote and

inspection opium poppies                            were in full bloom in one repeat one field they photographed in the                            Shamalan project area The photography could not have been duplicated                            often in other parts of the project area AID technicians along with a                            Peace Corps Volunteer were indeed working directly with the Afghan                            farmer teaching land levelling and other improved agricultural                            techniques in an adjacent field The farmer is a leaderone of the most                            progressive farmers in the project area The fact that he was                            cultivating a small plot of poppies at the time would now rule out his                            receiving any USfinanced advice USAID Director in May banned US support to individual                            farmers cultivating poppies in the project area While our people                            expressed disapproval over his poppy cultivation they were aware that                            negotiations underway leading to RGA                            contravention of poppy cultivationnationwide support for which is under consideration in                            Kabul Geneva Washington and other capitals would likely rule out his                            cultivation of poppies in the future Moreover they were aware that                            responding to an eagerness for help in acquiring new modern techniques                            would enhance his ability to prosper without resort to illegal                            means5 The northern part of the Helmand Valley from Girishk to the vicinity                            of the USfinanced Kajakal Dam is not a part of the HelmandArghandab                            Project area receiving US assistance It has benefitted of course                            from proximity but it is not a receiver of US aid6 AID has never ignored the fact that US financed improvements may be                            used by some farmers in inappropriate ways AID assistance decisions                            have been based on the assumption that people who can live a reasonable                            life for themselves and their children within legal means will chose                            such means over the illegal7 Poppy cultivation in the Helmand Valley as all over Afghanistan is                            more extensive this year than it was last year Exogenous forces ought                            we suspect be looked to for the explanation8 The Mission has in as the IG reports been concerned with poppy                            cultivation in Afghanistan for a number of years The Mission is as the                            report indicates anxious to support a comprehensive longterm plan to                            eliminate poppy cultivation throughout all of Afghanistan such as the                                UN is now suggesting A piecemeal                            effort by the US in so minimally affected an area as that encompassed                            by our projectwhere a withdrawal of US advice will hurt the majority                            of innocents in order to punish a few guiltyill suits the US image                            and character It would be particularly inappropriate at a point in time                            where the Palace and the Prime Ministry have expressed determination to                            take definitive steps countrywide with help from the international                            community to eliminate the cultivation of the poppy in Afghanistan9 The UN report has appropriately                            proposed that emphasis be placed on Badakshan and Nangrahar                            Provincesthese are the parts of the country where poppies are grown                            most profusely Efforts to curb poppy production must of course also                            include the Helmand Valley we identified this need in our March                            evaluation of the UN report10 We fully support the IG view that total suppression of illicit opium                            poppy cultivation should be undertaken at the earliest practicable date                                 AID has already taken on a                            unilateral basis with RGA support                            at some risk of getting ahead of the UN the first requisite stepsie an aerial survey prior to                            conclusion of this flowering poppy season of much of the Helmand Valley                            area Photography is completed and analysis is now underway11 Responding to American and growing worldwide concern over narcotics                            Mission has been arguing US support for multidonor efforts to provide                            the help Afghanistan needs to accomplish effective enforcement of the                            Afghan law prohibiting opium production12 Poppies are being grown in the open in Afghanistan but fact finding                            and planning lacking the ability to stop their cultivation while                            trying to mobilize a meaningful effort at enforcement aimed at                            elimination is not synonymous with toleration13 The HelmandArghandab Valley Authority HAVA does not lacking a viable concerted national                            effort posses a meaningful ability to enforce a ban on poppy growing                            Control over distribution of irrigation waters fertilizer improved                            seed technical assistance etc is not so individualized or divisible                            in this primitive interdependent environment as to be susceptible to                            directed and selective application14 AID recognizes a capacity despite its new collaborative and                            nondirective style to influence HAVA                            authorities and more importantly the central government who are                            dependent upon and deeply politically as well as economically                            interested in future flow of US funds to support desperately needed                            development Mission has made clear to RGA that continuation of assistance is critically dependent                            upon eradication of poppy production not in one small areabut                            throughout the country They have asked for the help needed to do this                            We are urging a full measure of US commitment to this important                            end15 Re IG recommendations: 1 Mission concurs but reiterates a concern                            for elimination of poppy production countrywide rather than a simple                            almost symbolic concern over the relatively small production from HAVA 2 Mission concurs such action has                            already been taken 3 Mission concurs in need to include Helmand                            Valley in UNled program but believes in                            broader US and worldwide interest that top priority should be                            focused on major production areas of Afghanistan since our most serious                            concern is quickest possible limitation of world narcotics supply16 Wrapup and additional background: A The Mission has and is taking                            steps directed against opium production in the Helmand Valley If new project for the Valley is                            programmedbeginning in July 1974steps by RGA to eliminate poppy production in area to be                            precondition to new project activities USAID some months back issued instructions precluding                            technical assistance from US advisors to poppy growers Plan requires                            borrowers under proposed small farmer credit program to sign in loan                            instrument a covenant requiring that inputs will not be utilized in                            growing poppies or other illegal crops USG aiding and urging UN and                                RGA to reach agreement on proposed                            national poppy eradication programB USAID staff members prepared report                            on poppy production Poppies in Afghanistan Owens and Clifton                            published June 1972 based on interviews with farmers in all known poppy                            producing areas in the country except Badakshan where not permitted                            entry At that time opium production in Helmand Valley appeared to be                            decreasing because of 1 low price for gum in bazaar 2 enforcement                            efforts of Government of Iran and 3 farmers considered opium an                            unpleasant crop to raiseC This year however evidence began to mount indicating that something                            which we are unable to firmly establish had happened to trigger an increase in acreage of                            opium poppy The number of poppy fields countrywide appeared to have                            increased several fold May 4 overflight of HelmandArghandab area

areas and then                            Shamalan at an altitude of about 800 feet above ground level Poppy                            fields plainly were visible and rather easily identified by all air                            passengers at this height crude estimate basis overflight and ground                            reconnaissance indicated that up to 1015 percent of land was in poppy                            in some parts of the Sanguin Valley north of an outside of                            HelmandArghandab Valley Authority project area while in USassisted                                HAVA project area poppy production                            varied from nothing to perhaps a high of 1 to 2 Previous year                            estimates were only one tenth of this yearsD Mission over past many months has been aware of growing problem of                            opium production in Afghanistan and has discussed its seriousness at                            many Afghan levels from the King and the PM down through HAVA leadership to local agricultural                            extension agents and opium producing farmersE It is an unfortunately fact that much modern agricultural technology                            may be just as effective when applied to opium poppy as when applied to                            wheat or corn for which originally developed It probably is true that                            if poppy is planted in field where modern techniques were used to grow                            wheat in previous years yield of opium will be somewhat higher because                            of residual fertilizer reduced stand of weeds and slightly improved                            level of landF As far as we have been able to determine in these circumstances the                            poppy production problem cannot be overcome even by resort to a a                            general withholding knowledge of new technology and b withholding                            actual inputs in this case fertilizer and water Realistically a                            and b constitute panicky desperate impracticable steps An effective                            enforcement program to prevent production is necessary and difficult but                            will work only to extent farmer can make living from other crops                            Americans in Valley can influence a number of decisions affecting                            development activities but they cannot shut off supplies from bazaar                            seed and fertilizer and they cannot shut off water Even RGA would have difficulty denying water                            either because traditional irrigation structures are beyond practical RGA control or because closing off one guilty farmer may                            shut off the water from dozens of his innocent neighbors It is even                            impossible for US to completely close off supply of new technology to                            offending farmers since they can learn from their neighbors or by seeing                            new ways of doing things from bus windowG USG does not permit anything in                            sovereign Afghanistan We either assist or refrain from assisting                                USAID Director has issued orders                            that no one in Mission will knowingly work with any farmer cultivating                            opium poppies We also expect proposed small farmer credit program to                            contain provision that credit will not be given to farmers who expect to                            produce opium and that fertilizer purchased on credit is not to be used                            for opium productionH Indictment of the Valley authorities and AID by the inspectorson                            truistic perverse grounds that AIDs decision regarding assistance                            to farmers of the Helmand Valley have largely ignored fact that                            USfinanced improvements may also help these same farmers raise better                            opium poppy cropsignores fact that current thinking within AID the                                UN and other nations and donors is                            that in the long run only hope for getting rid of opium even with a                            strong enforcement program is to                            teach farmers how to feed and clothe family without resorting to poppy                            production and by making necessary inputs readily available so that this                            is possibleI For over a year the Mission has been discussing with RGA possible development of new projects in                            Helmand and in agriculture for whole country As discussions continue                            and if negotiations commence on the Helmand Valley banning of poppy                            production in project area is expected to be major point For some parts                            of country not Helmand Development of Afghan research capability is                            essential Assistance will also be required in order for agricultural                            extension service to improve information gathering and dissemination                            capability so that farmers can be taught sufficiently profitable methods                            of farming to keep them from turning to poppy desperationJ Area where inspectors found highest concentration of poppy between                            Girishk and Kajakai is not in HAVA                            project although it is in Helmand Valley Much of poppy produced                            elsewhere in the Valley is outside of the project area as water on the                            fringes is available intermittently but not regularly enough to produce                            good crops of wheat or other foodsK US assists HAVA but is not involved                            in civil governing of area Although President of HAVA is also Governor of Helmand Province                                Mission staff in no way                            serve as counterparts to the Governor They are counterparts only to                            President of HAVA and his staff who are                            charged with developing project area in an engineering and

                       leverage under its control to encourage these changesL The Mission still hopes that the UNFAO                            proposal already accepted by RGA will                            be accepted by the UN agencies and other                            donors and that action on it will start shortly after the Geneva                            meetings in July17 FYI: Mission

voluminous cable traffic attests The poppy problem in Afghanistan is                            not a Helmand Valley problem nor is it a problem to be approachedwith                            panic mentalityin terms of the Helmand valley project where poppy                            cultivation problem generally and increase this year appears to be among                            most minimal in Afghanistan The                            poppy problem is country wide Its most serious manifestations                            moreover are outside the project area being supported by USAID While planting to the poppy is                            estimated at 1015 of total cultivation in some locations outside the                            USassisted project area plots within the project area show zero to                            12 cultivation in poppies A clear indication that US                            financiallysupported improvements have helped Helmand Valley Project                            farmers to earn a liveable income without resort to illegal crops                            Irrigation drainage land levelling use of fertilizers and improved                            seeds and teaching of better framing practices has given the farmers                            of the USsupported area more ability to resist the extraordinary                            economic incentives of poppy cultivation USG inputs are of course neutral inputsat worst they                            improve the farmers capacity at whatever he undertakes but at best they                            give farmers viable alternatives to clandestineillegal operations2 The observation of extensive cultivation of illicit opium poppies on                            project lands in the Helmand Valley is erroneous The Helmand Valley is                            extensive the project area limited poppy cultivation on project lands                            is relatively extremely limited3 Large US financial outlays at the expense of the US taxpayers to suppress opium production in                            such countries as Turkey Thailand and Mexico suggest a simple economic                            explanation for what may be extraordinarily heightened rewards to the                            illicit cultivator of opium poppies in remote and underdeveloped                            Afghanistan where the fragility of life is greatsurvival itself a                            dangerous game and where rural economic desperation following two                            drought years may have provided considerable special incentive to high                            value poppy cultivation this year4 At the time of Messrs Kraft and Marvins inspection opium poppies                            were in full bloom in one repeat one field they photographed in the                            Shamalan project area The photography could not have been duplicated                            often in other parts of the project area AID technicians along with a                            Peace Corps Volunteer were indeed working directly with the Afghan                            farmer teaching land levelling and other improved agricultural                            techniques in an adjacent field The farmer is a leaderone of the most                            progressive farmers in the project area The fact that he was                            cultivating a small plot of poppies at the time would now rule out his                            receiving any USfinanced advice USAID Director in May banned US support to individual                            farmers cultivating poppies in the project area While our people                            expressed disapproval over his poppy cultivation they were aware that                            negotiations underway leading to RGA                            contravention of poppy cultivationnationwide support for which is under consideration in                            Kabul Geneva Washington and other capitals would likely rule out his                            cultivation of poppies in the future Moreover they were aware that                            responding to an eagerness for help in acquiring new modern techniques                            would enhance his ability to prosper without resort to illegal                            means5 The northern part of the Helmand Valley from Girishk to the vicinity                            of the USfinanced Kajakal Dam is not a part of the HelmandArghandab                            Project area receiving US assistance It has benefitted of course                            from proximity but it is not a receiver of US aid6 AID has never ignored the fact that US financed improvements may be                            used by some farmers in inappropriate ways AID assistance decisions                            have been based on the assumption that people who can live a reasonable                            life for themselves and their children within legal means will chose                            such means over the illegal7 Poppy cultivation in the Helmand Valley as all over Afghanistan is                            more extensive this year than it was last year Exogenous forces ought                            we suspect be looked to for the explanation8 The Mission has in as the IG reports been concerned with poppy                            cultivation in Afghanistan for a number of years The Mission is as the                            report indicates anxious to support a comprehensive longterm plan to                            eliminate poppy cultivation throughout all of Afghanistan such as the                                UN is now suggesting A piecemeal                            effort by the US in so minimally affected an area as that encompassed                            by our projectwhere a withdrawal of US advice will hurt the majority                            of innocents in order to punish a few guiltyill suits the US image                            and character It would be particularly inappropriate at a point in time                            where the Palace and the Prime Ministry have expressed determination to                            take definitive steps countrywide with help from the international                            community to eliminate the cultivation of the poppy in Afghanistan9 The UN report has appropriately                            proposed that emphasis be placed on Badakshan and Nangrahar                            Provincesthese are the parts of the country where poppies are grown                            most profusely Efforts to curb poppy production must of course also                            include the Helmand Valley we identified this need in our March                            evaluation of the UN report10 We fully support the IG view that total suppression of illicit opium                            poppy cultivation should be undertaken at the earliest practicable date                                 AID has already taken on a                            unilateral basis with RGA support                            at some risk of getting ahead of the UN the first requisite stepsie an aerial survey prior to                            conclusion of this flowering poppy season of much of the Helmand Valley                            area Photography is completed and analysis is now underway11 Responding to American and growing worldwide concern over narcotics                            Mission has been arguing US support for multidonor efforts to provide                            the help Afghanistan needs to accomplish effective enforcement of the                            Afghan law prohibiting opium production12 Poppies are being grown in the open in Afghanistan but fact finding                            and planning lacking the ability to stop their cultivation while                            trying to mobilize a meaningful effort at enforcement aimed at                            elimination is not synonymous with toleration13 The HelmandArghandab Valley Authority HAVA does not lacking a viable concerted national                            effort posses a meaningful ability to enforce a ban on poppy growing                            Control over distribution of irrigation waters fertilizer improved                            seed technical assistance etc is not so individualized or divisible                            in this primitive interdependent environment as to be susceptible to                            directed and selective application14 AID recognizes a capacity despite its new collaborative and                            nondirective style to influence HAVA                            authorities and more importantly the central government who are                            dependent upon and deeply politically as well as economically                            interested in future flow of US funds to support desperately needed                            development Mission has made clear to RGA that continuation of assistance is critically dependent                            upon eradication of poppy production not in one small areabut                            throughout the country They have asked for the help needed to do this                            We are urging a full measure of US commitment to this important                            end15 Re IG recommendations: 1 Mission concurs but reiterates a concern                            for elimination of poppy production countrywide rather than a simple                            almost symbolic concern over the relatively small production from HAVA 2 Mission concurs such action has                            already been taken 3 Mission concurs in need to include Helmand                            Valley in UNled program but believes in                            broader US and worldwide interest that top priority should be                            focused on major production areas of Afghanistan since our most serious                            concern is quickest possible limitation of world narcotics supply16 Wrapup and additional background: A The Mission has and is taking                            steps directed against opium production in the Helmand Valley If new project for the Valley is                            programmedbeginning in July 1974steps by RGA to eliminate poppy production in area to be                            precondition to new project activities USAID

small farmer credit program to sign in loan                            instrument a covenant requiring that inputs will not be utilized in                            growing poppies or other illegal crops USG aiding and urging UN and                                RGA to reach agreement on proposed                            national poppy eradication programB USAID staff members prepared report                            on poppy production Poppies in Afghanistan Owens and Clifton                            published June 1972 based on interviews with farmers in all known poppy                            producing areas in the country except Badakshan where not permitted                            entry At that time opium production in Helmand Valley appeared to be                            decreasing because of 1 low price for gum in bazaar 2 enforcement                            efforts of Government of Iran and 3 farmers considered opium an                            unpleasant crop to raiseC This year however evidence began to mount indicating that something                            which we are unable to firmly establish had happened to trigger an increase in acreage of                            opium poppy The number of poppy fields countrywide appeared to have                            increased several fold May 4 overflight of HelmandArghandab area

areas and then                            Shamalan at an altitude of about 800 feet above ground level Poppy                            fields plainly were visible and rather easily identified by all

                       in some parts of the Sanguin Valley north of an outside of                            HelmandArghandab Valley Authority project area while in USassisted                                HAVA project area poppy production                            varied from nothing to perhaps a high of 1 to 2 Previous year                            estimates were only one tenth of this yearsD Mission over past many months has been aware of growing problem of                            opium production in Afghanistan and has discussed its seriousness at                            many Afghan levels from the King and the PM down through HAVA leadership to local agricultural                            extension agents and opium producing farmersE It is an unfortunately fact that much modern agricultural technology                            may be just as effective when applied to opium poppy as when applied to                            wheat or corn for which originally developed It probably is true that                            if poppy is planted in field where modern techniques were used to grow                            wheat in previous years yield of opium will be somewhat higher because                            of residual fertilizer reduced stand of weeds and slightly improved                            level of landF As far as we have been able to determine in these circumstances the                            poppy production problem cannot be overcome even by resort to a a                            general withholding knowledge of new technology and b withholding                            actual inputs in this case fertilizer and water Realistically a                            and b constitute panicky desperate impracticable steps An effective                            enforcement program to prevent production is necessary and difficult but                            will work only to extent farmer can make living from other crops                            Americans in Valley can influence a number of decisions affecting                            development activities but they cannot shut off supplies from bazaar                            seed and fertilizer and they cannot shut off water Even RGA would have difficulty denying water                            either because traditional irrigation structures are beyond practical RGA control or because closing off one guilty farmer may                            shut off the water from dozens of his innocent neighbors It is even                            impossible for US to completely close off supply of new technology to                            offending farmers since they can learn from their neighbors or by seeing                            new ways of doing things from bus windowG USG does not permit anything in                            sovereign Afghanistan We either assist or refrain from assisting                                USAID Director has issued orders                            that no one in Mission will knowingly work with any farmer cultivating                            opium poppies We also expect proposed small farmer credit program to                            contain provision that credit will not be given to farmers who expect to                            produce opium and that fertilizer purchased on credit is not to be used                            for opium productionH Indictment of the Valley authorities and AID by the inspectorson                            truistic perverse grounds that AIDs decision regarding assistance                            to farmers of the Helmand Valley have largely ignored fact that                            USfinanced improvements may also help these same farmers raise better                            opium poppy cropsignores fact that current thinking within AID the                                UN and other nations and donors is                            that in the long run only hope for getting rid of opium even with a                            strong enforcement program is to                            teach farmers how to feed and clothe family without resorting to poppy                            production and by making necessary inputs readily available so that this                            is possibleI For over a year the Mission has been discussing with RGA possible development of new projects in                            Helmand and in agriculture for whole country As discussions continue                            and if negotiations commence on the Helmand Valley banning of poppy                            production in project area is expected to be major point For some parts                            of

service to improve information gathering and dissemination                            capability so that farmers can be taught sufficiently profitable methods                            of farming to keep them from turning to poppy desperationJ Area where inspectors found highest concentration of poppy between                            Girishk and Kajakai is not in HAVA                            project although it is in Helmand Valley Much of poppy produced                            elsewhere in the Valley is outside of the project area as water on the                            fringes is available intermittently but not regularly enough to produce                            good crops of wheat or other foodsK US assists HAVA but is not involved                            in civil

       to eradicate cultivation of opium poppies in the USsponsored Helmand                            Valley project area Mission has itself been advocating positive                            Washington interagency support and action to counter growing narcotics                            problem in Afghanistan since beginning of yearas you well aware and as                            voluminous cable traffic attests The poppy problem in Afghanistan is                            not a Helmand Valley problem nor is it a problem to be approachedwith                            panic mentalityin terms of the Helmand valley project where poppy                            cultivation problem generally and increase this year appears to be among                            most minimal in Afghanistan The                            poppy problem is country wide Its most serious manifestations                            moreover are outside the project area being supported by USAID While planting to the poppy is                            estimated at 1015 of total cultivation in some locations outside the                            USassisted project area plots within the project area show zero to                            12 cultivation in poppies A clear indication that US                            financiallysupported improvements have helped Helmand Valley Project                            farmers to earn a liveable income without resort to illegal crops                            Irrigation drainage land levelling use of fertilizers and improved                            seeds and teaching of better framing practices has given the farmers                            of the USsupported area more ability to resist the extraordinary                            economic incentives of poppy cultivation USG inputs are of course neutral inputsat worst they                            improve the farmers capacity at whatever he undertakes but at best they                            give farmers viable alternatives to clandestineillegal operations2 The observation of extensive cultivation of illicit opium poppies on                            project lands in the Helmand Valley is erroneous The Helmand Valley is                            extensive the project area limited poppy cultivation on project lands                            is relatively extremely limited3 Large US financial outlays at the expense of the US taxpayers to suppress opium production in                            such countries as Turkey Thailand and Mexico suggest a simple economic                            explanation for what may be extraordinarily heightened rewards to the                            illicit cultivator of opium poppies in remote and underdeveloped                            Afghanistan where the fragility of life is greatsurvival itself a                            dangerous game and where rural economic desperation following two                            drought years may have provided considerable special incentive to high                            value poppy cultivation this year4 At the time of Messrs Kraft and Marvins inspection opium poppies                            were in full bloom in one repeat one field they photographed in the                            Shamalan project area The photography could not have been duplicated                            often in other parts of the project area AID technicians along with a                            Peace Corps Volunteer were indeed working directly with the Afghan                            farmer teaching land levelling and other improved agricultural                            techniques in an adjacent field The farmer is a leaderone of the most                            progressive farmers in the project area The fact that he was                            cultivating a small plot of poppies at the time would now rule out his                            receiving any USfinanced advice USAID Director in May banned US support to individual                            farmers cultivating poppies in the project area While our people                            expressed disapproval over his poppy cultivation they were aware that                            negotiations underway leading to RGA                            contravention of poppy cultivationnationwide support for which is under consideration in                            Kabul Geneva Washington and other capitals would likely rule out his                            cultivation of poppies in the future Moreover they were aware that                            responding to an eagerness for help in acquiring new modern techniques                            would enhance his ability to prosper without resort to illegal                            means5 The northern part of the Helmand Valley from Girishk to the vicinity                            of the USfinanced Kajakal Dam is not a part of the HelmandArghandab                            Project area receiving US assistance It has benefitted of course                            from proximity but it is not a receiver of US aid6 AID has never ignored the fact that US financed improvements may be                            used by some farmers in inappropriate ways AID assistance decisions                            have been based on the assumption that people who can live a reasonable                            life for themselves and their children within legal means will chose                            such means over the illegal7 Poppy cultivation in the Helmand Valley as all over Afghanistan is                            more extensive this year than it was last year Exogenous forces ought                            we suspect be looked to for the explanation8 The Mission has in as the IG reports been concerned with poppy                            cultivation in Afghanistan for a number of years The Mission is as the                            report indicates anxious to support a comprehensive longterm plan to                            eliminate poppy cultivation throughout all of Afghanistan such as the                                UN is now suggesting A piecemeal                            effort by the US in so minimally affected an area as that encompassed                            by our projectwhere a withdrawal of US advice will hurt the majority                            of innocents in order to punish a few guiltyill suits the US image                            and character It would be particularly inappropriate at a point in time                            where the Palace and the Prime Ministry have expressed determination to                            take definitive steps countrywide with help from the international                            community to eliminate the cultivation of the poppy in Afghanistan9 The UN report has appropriately                            proposed that emphasis be placed on Badakshan and Nangrahar                            Provincesthese are the parts of the country where poppies are grown                            most profusely Efforts to curb poppy production must of course also                            include the Helmand Valley we identified this need in our March                            evaluation of the UN report10 We fully support the IG view that total suppression of illicit opium                            poppy cultivation should be undertaken at the earliest practicable date                                 AID has already taken on a                            unilateral basis with RGA support                            at some risk of getting ahead of the UN the first requisite stepsie an aerial survey prior to                            conclusion of this flowering poppy season of much of the Helmand Valley                            area Photography is completed and analysis is now underway11 Responding to American and growing worldwide concern over narcotics                            Mission has been arguing US support for multidonor efforts to provide                            the help Afghanistan needs to accomplish effective enforcement of the                            Afghan law prohibiting opium production12 Poppies are being grown in the open in Afghanistan but fact finding                            and planning lacking the ability to stop their cultivation while                            trying to mobilize a meaningful effort at enforcement aimed at                            elimination is not synonymous with toleration13 The HelmandArghandab Valley Authority HAVA does not lacking a viable concerted national                            effort posses a meaningful ability to enforce a ban on poppy growing                            Control over distribution of irrigation waters fertilizer improved                            seed technical assistance etc is not so individualized or divisible                            in this primitive interdependent environment as to be susceptible to                            directed and selective application14 AID recognizes a capacity despite its new collaborative and                            nondirective style to influence HAVA                            authorities and more importantly the central government who are                            dependent upon and deeply politically as well as economically                            interested in future flow of US funds to support desperately needed                            development Mission has made clear to RGA that continuation of assistance is critically dependent                            upon eradication of poppy production not in one small areabut                            throughout the country They have asked for the help needed to do this                            We are urging a full measure of US commitment to this important                            end15 Re IG recommendations: 1 Mission concurs but reiterates a concern                            for elimination of poppy production countrywide rather than a simple                            almost symbolic concern over the relatively small production from HAVA 2 Mission concurs such action has                            already been taken 3 Mission concurs in need to include Helmand                            Valley in UNled program but believes in                            broader US and worldwide interest that top priority should be                            focused on major production areas of Afghanistan since our most serious                            concern is quickest possible limitation of world narcotics supply16 Wrapup and additional background: A The Mission has and is taking                            steps directed against opium production in the Helmand Valley If new project for the Valley is                            programmedbeginning in July 1974steps by RGA to eliminate poppy production in area to be                            precondition to new project activities USAID some months back issued instructions precluding                            technical assistance from US advisors to poppy growers Plan requires                            borrowers under proposed small farmer credit program to sign in loan                            instrument a covenant requiring that inputs will not be utilized in                            growing poppies or other illegal crops USG aiding and urging UN and                                RGA to reach agreement on proposed                            national poppy eradication programB USAID staff members prepared report                            on poppy production Poppies in Afghanistan Owens and Clifton                            published June 1972 based on interviews with farmers in all known poppy                            producing areas in the country except Badakshan where not permitted                            entry At that time opium production in Helmand Valley appeared to be                            decreasing because of 1 low price for gum in bazaar 2 enforcement                            efforts of Government of Iran and 3 farmers considered opium an                            unpleasant crop to raiseC This year however evidence began to mount indicating that something                            which we are unable to firmly establish had happened to trigger an increase in acreage of                            opium poppy The number of poppy fields countrywide appeared to have                            increased several fold May 4 overflight of HelmandArghandab area

areas and then                            Shamalan at an altitude of about 800 feet above ground level Poppy                            fields plainly were visible and rather easily identified by all

                       in some parts of the Sanguin Valley north of an outside of                            HelmandArghandab Valley Authority project area while in USassisted                                HAVA project area poppy production                            varied from nothing to perhaps a high of 1 to 2 Previous year                            estimates were only one tenth of this yearsD Mission over past many months has been aware of growing problem of                            opium production in Afghanistan and has discussed its seriousness at                            many Afghan levels from the King and the PM down through HAVA leadership to local agricultural                            extension agents and opium producing farmersE It is an unfortunately fact that much modern agricultural technology                            may be just as effective when applied to opium poppy as when applied to                            wheat or corn for which originally developed It probably is true that                            if poppy is planted in field where modern techniques were used to grow                            wheat in previous years yield of opium will be somewhat higher because                            of residual fertilizer reduced stand of weeds and slightly improved                            level of landF As far as we have been able to determine in these circumstances the                            poppy production problem cannot be overcome even by resort to a a                            general withholding knowledge of new technology and b withholding                            actual inputs in this case fertilizer and water Realistically a                            and b constitute panicky desperate impracticable steps An effective                            enforcement program to prevent production is necessary and difficult but                            will work only to extent farmer can make living from other crops                            Americans in Valley can influence a number of decisions affecting                            development activities but they cannot shut off supplies from bazaar                            seed and fertilizer and they cannot shut off water Even RGA would have difficulty denying water                            either because traditional irrigation structures are beyond practical RGA control or because closing off one guilty farmer may                            shut off the water from dozens of his innocent neighbors It is even                            impossible for US to completely close off supply of new technology to                            offending farmers since they can learn from their neighbors or by seeing                            new ways of doing things from bus windowG USG does not permit anything in                            sovereign Afghanistan We either assist or refrain from assisting                                USAID Director has issued orders                            that no one in Mission will knowingly work with any farmer cultivating                            opium poppies We also expect proposed small farmer credit program to                            contain provision that credit will not be given to farmers who expect to                            produce opium and that fertilizer purchased on

AIDs decision regarding assistance                            to farmers of the Helmand Valley have largely ignored fact that                            USfinanced improvements may also help these same farmers raise better                            opium poppy cropsignores fact that current thinking within AID the                                UN and other nations and donors is                            that in the long run only hope for getting rid of opium even with a                            strong enforcement program is to                            teach farmers how to feed and clothe family without resorting to poppy                            production and by making necessary inputs readily available so that this                            is possibleI For over a year the Mission has been discussing with RGA possible development of new projects in                            Helmand and in agriculture for whole country As discussions continue                            and if negotiations commence on the Helmand Valley banning of poppy                            production in project area is expected to be major point For some parts                            of

keep them from turning to poppy desperationJ Area where inspectors found highest concentration of poppy between                            Girishk and Kajakai is not in HAVA                            project although it is in Helmand Valley Much of poppy produced                            elsewhere in the Valley is outside of the project area as water on the                            fringes is available intermittently but not regularly enough to produce                            good crops of wheat or other foodsK US assists HAVA but is not involved                            in civil

                       leverage under its control to encourage these changesL The Mission still hopes that the UNFAO                            proposal already accepted by RGA will                            be accepted by the UN agencies and other                            donors and that action on it will start shortly after the Geneva                            meetings in July17 FYI: Mission

       to eradicate cultivation of opium poppies in the USsponsored Helmand                            Valley project area Mission has itself been advocating positive                            Washington interagency support and action to counter growing narcotics                            problem in Afghanistan since beginning of yearas you well aware and as                            voluminous cable traffic attests The poppy problem in Afghanistan is                            not a Helmand Valley problem nor is it a problem to be approachedwith                            panic mentalityin terms of the Helmand valley project where poppy                            cultivation problem generally and increase this year appears to be among                            most minimal in Afghanistan The                            poppy problem is country wide Its most serious manifestations                            moreover are outside the project area being supported by USAID While planting to the poppy is                            estimated at 1015 of total cultivation in some locations outside the                            USassisted project area plots within the project area show zero to                            12 cultivation in poppies A clear indication that US                            financiallysupported improvements have helped Helmand Valley Project                            farmers to earn a liveable income without resort to illegal crops                            Irrigation drainage land levelling use of fertilizers and improved                            seeds and teaching of better framing practices has given the farmers                            of the USsupported area more ability to resist the extraordinary                            economic incentives of poppy cultivation USG inputs are of course neutral inputsat worst they                            improve the farmers capacity at whatever he undertakes but at best they                            give farmers viable alternatives to clandestineillegal operations2 The observation of extensive cultivation of illicit opium poppies on                            project lands in the Helmand Valley is erroneous The Helmand Valley is                            extensive the project area limited poppy cultivation on project lands                            is relatively extremely limited3 Large US financial outlays at the expense of the US taxpayers to suppress opium production in                            such countries as Turkey Thailand and Mexico suggest a simple economic                            explanation for what may be extraordinarily heightened rewards to the                            illicit cultivator of opium poppies in remote and underdeveloped                            Afghanistan where the fragility of life is greatsurvival itself a                            dangerous game and where rural economic desperation following two                            drought years may have provided considerable special incentive to high                            value poppy cultivation this year4 At the time of Messrs Kraft and Marvins inspection opium poppies                            were in full bloom in one repeat one field they photographed in the                            Shamalan project area The photography could not have been duplicated                            often in other parts of the project area AID technicians along with a                            Peace Corps Volunteer were indeed working directly with the Afghan                            farmer teaching land levelling and other improved agricultural                            techniques in an adjacent field The farmer is a leaderone of the most                            progressive farmers in the project area The fact that he was                            cultivating a small plot of poppies at the time would now rule out his                            receiving any USfinanced advice USAID Director in May banned US support to individual                            farmers cultivating poppies in the project area While our people                            expressed disapproval over his poppy cultivation they were aware that                            negotiations underway leading to RGA                            contravention of poppy cultivationnationwide support for which is under consideration in                            Kabul Geneva Washington and other capitals would likely rule out his                            cultivation of poppies in the future Moreover they were aware that                            responding to an eagerness for help in acquiring new modern techniques                            would enhance his ability to prosper without resort to illegal                            means5 The northern part of the Helmand Valley from Girishk to the vicinity                            of the USfinanced Kajakal Dam is not a part of the HelmandArghandab                            Project area receiving US assistance It has benefitted of course                            from proximity but it is not a receiver of US aid6 AID has never ignored the fact that US financed improvements may be                            used by some farmers in inappropriate ways AID assistance decisions                            have been based on the assumption that people who can live a reasonable                            life for themselves and their children within legal means will chose                            such means over the illegal7 Poppy cultivation in the Helmand Valley as all over Afghanistan is                            more extensive this year than it was last year Exogenous forces ought                            we suspect be looked to for the explanation8 The Mission has in as the IG reports been concerned with poppy                            cultivation in Afghanistan for a number of years The Mission is as the                            report indicates anxious to support a comprehensive longterm plan to                            eliminate poppy cultivation throughout all of Afghanistan such as the                                UN is now suggesting A piecemeal                            effort by the US in so minimally affected an area as that encompassed                            by our projectwhere a withdrawal of US advice will hurt the majority                            of innocents in order to punish a few guiltyill suits the US image                            and character It would be particularly inappropriate at a point in time                            where the Palace and the Prime Ministry have expressed determination to                            take definitive steps countrywide with help from the international                            community to eliminate the cultivation of the poppy in Afghanistan9 The UN report has appropriately                            proposed that emphasis be placed on Badakshan and Nangrahar                            Provincesthese are the parts of the country where poppies are grown                            most profusely Efforts to curb poppy production must of course also                            include the Helmand Valley we identified this need in our March                            evaluation of the UN report10 We fully support the IG view that total suppression of illicit opium                            poppy cultivation should be undertaken at the earliest practicable date                                 AID has already taken on a                            unilateral basis with RGA support                            at some risk of getting ahead of the UN the first requisite stepsie an aerial survey prior to                            conclusion of this flowering poppy season of much of the Helmand Valley                            area Photography is completed and analysis is now underway11 Responding to American and growing worldwide concern over narcotics                            Mission has been arguing US support for multidonor efforts to provide                            the help Afghanistan needs to accomplish effective enforcement of the                            Afghan law prohibiting opium production12 Poppies are being grown in the open in Afghanistan but fact finding                            and planning lacking the ability to stop their cultivation while                            trying to mobilize a meaningful effort at enforcement aimed at                            elimination is not synonymous with toleration13 The HelmandArghandab Valley Authority HAVA does not lacking a viable concerted national                            effort posses a meaningful ability to enforce a ban on poppy growing                            Control over distribution of irrigation waters fertilizer improved                            seed technical assistance etc is not so individualized or divisible                            in this primitive interdependent environment as to be susceptible to                            directed and selective application14 AID recognizes a capacity despite its new collaborative and                            nondirective style to influence HAVA                            authorities and more importantly the central government who are                            dependent upon and deeply politically as well as economically                            interested in future flow of US funds to support desperately needed                            development Mission has made clear to RGA that continuation of assistance is critically dependent                            upon eradication of poppy production not in one small areabut                            throughout the country They have asked for the help needed to do this                            We are urging a full measure of US commitment to this important                            end15 Re IG recommendations: 1 Mission concurs but reiterates a concern                            for elimination of poppy production countrywide rather than a simple                            almost symbolic concern over the relatively small production from HAVA 2 Mission concurs such action has                            already been taken 3 Mission concurs in need to include Helmand                            Valley in UNled program but believes in                            broader US and worldwide interest that top priority should be                            focused on major production areas of Afghanistan since our most serious                            concern is quickest possible limitation of world

small farmer credit program to sign in loan                            instrument a covenant requiring that inputs will not be utilized in                            growing poppies or other illegal crops USG aiding and urging UN and                                RGA to reach agreement on proposed                            national poppy eradication programB USAID staff members prepared report                            on poppy production Poppies in Afghanistan Owens and Clifton                            published June 1972 based on interviews with farmers in all known poppy                            producing areas in the country except Badakshan where not permitted                            entry At that time opium production in Helmand Valley appeared to be                            decreasing because of 1 low price for gum in bazaar 2 enforcement                            efforts of Government of Iran and 3 farmers considered opium an                            unpleasant crop to raiseC This year however evidence began to mount indicating that something                            which we are unable to firmly establish had happened to trigger an increase in acreage of                            opium poppy The number of poppy fields countrywide appeared to have                            increased several fold May 4 overflight of HelmandArghandab area

areas and then                            Shamalan at an altitude of about 800 feet above ground level Poppy                            fields plainly were visible and rather easily identified by all

                       in some parts of the Sanguin Valley north of an outside of                            HelmandArghandab Valley Authority project area while in USassisted                                HAVA project area poppy production                            varied from nothing to perhaps a high of 1 to 2 Previous year                            estimates were only one tenth of this yearsD Mission over past many months has been aware of growing problem of                            opium production in Afghanistan and has discussed its seriousness at                            many Afghan levels from the King and the PM down through HAVA leadership to local agricultural                            extension agents and opium producing farmersE It is an unfortunately fact that much modern agricultural technology                            may be just as effective when applied to opium poppy as when applied to                            wheat or corn for which originally developed It probably is true that                            if poppy is planted in field where modern techniques were used to grow                            wheat in previous years yield of opium will be somewhat higher because                            of residual fertilizer reduced stand of weeds and slightly improved                            level of landF As far as we have been able to determine in these circumstances the                            poppy production problem cannot be overcome even by resort to a a                            general withholding knowledge of new

steps An effective                            enforcement program to prevent production is necessary and difficult but                            will work only to extent farmer can make living from other crops                            Americans in Valley can influence a number of decisions affecting                            development activities but they cannot shut off supplies from bazaar                            seed and fertilizer and they cannot shut off water Even RGA would have difficulty denying water                            either because traditional irrigation structures are beyond practical RGA control or because closing off one guilty farmer may                            shut off the water from dozens of his innocent neighbors It is even                            impossible for US to completely close off supply of new technology to                            offending farmers since they can learn from their neighbors or by seeing                            new ways of doing things from bus windowG USG does not permit anything in                            sovereign Afghanistan We either assist or refrain from assisting                                USAID Director has issued orders                            that no one in Mission will knowingly work with any farmer cultivating                            opium poppies We also expect proposed small farmer credit program to                            contain provision that credit will not be given to farmers who expect to                            produce opium and that fertilizer purchased on credit is not to be used                            for opium productionH Indictment of the Valley authorities and AID by the inspectorson                            truistic perverse grounds that AIDs decision regarding assistance                            to farmers of the Helmand Valley have largely ignored fact that                            USfinanced improvements may also help these same farmers raise better                            opium poppy cropsignores fact that current thinking within AID the                                UN and other nations and donors is                            that in the long run only hope for getting rid of opium even with a                            strong enforcement program is to                            teach farmers how to feed and clothe family without resorting to poppy                            production and by making necessary inputs readily available so that this                            is possibleI For over a year the Mission has been discussing with RGA possible development of new projects in                            Helmand and in agriculture for whole country As discussions continue                            and if negotiations commence on the Helmand Valley banning of poppy                            production in project area is expected to be major point For some parts                            of

service to improve information gathering and dissemination                            capability so that farmers can be taught sufficiently profitable methods                            of farming to keep them from turning to poppy desperationJ Area where inspectors found highest concentration of poppy between                            Girishk and Kajakai is not in HAVA                            project although it is in Helmand Valley Much of poppy produced                            elsewhere in the Valley is outside of the project area as water on the                            fringes is available intermittently but not regularly enough to produce                            good crops of wheat or other foodsK US assists HAVA but is not involved                            in civil governing of area Although President of HAVA is also Governor of Helmand Province                                Mission staff in no way                            serve as counterparts to the

                       leverage under its control to encourage these changesL The Mission still hopes that the UNFAO                            proposal already accepted by RGA will                            be accepted by the UN agencies and other                            donors and that action on it will start shortly after the Geneva                            meetings in July17 FYI: Mission

IT NOW CLEAR THAT JULY 17 COUP WAS EXECUTED BY SMALL NUMBER JUNIOR OFFICERS, PERHAPS AS FEW AS 15 LIEUTENANTS AND CAPTAINS AND 300 OR FEWER ORDINARY SOLDIERS. INDICATIONS ARE THAT NEW REGIMES LEADERSHIP, FAR FROM HAVING PRECONCEIVED PROGRAM OF ACTION, HAD CONCENTRATED UNTIL JULY 17 SOLELY ON SEIZURE OF POWER. NEW GOVERNMENT MADE STRONG INITIAL EFFORT TO PRESENTPOSTURE OF CONFIDENCE, VITALITY AND BUREAUCRATIC CONTINUITY, BUT THESE WERE PRIMARILY COSMETICS DESIGNED TO ASSURE A SHOCKED POPULACE AND TO GAIN DIPLOMATIC RECOGNITION FROM WORLD.\n2.EXTENT TO WHICH ESSENTIAL GOVERNMENT SERVICES (CMMUNICATIONS, POLICE, TRAVEL) HAVE BEEN RESUMED IS ENCOURAGING; BUT CONTINUATION OF POSITIVE ACTIVITIES PREVIOUS REGIME IS UNDERGOING NOTICEABLE SLOWDOWN. OBVIOUS LACK OF POSTCOUP PLANNING PERHAPS EXPLAINABLE SIMPLY BECAUSE PLOTTERS DID NOT EXPECT TO SUCCEED SO EASILY; HOWEVER IT ALSO LIKELY THAT (AS DATT HAS REPORTED IR-6-800-0155-\n3. NEW REGIMES LEADERSHIP IN CENTRAL COMMITTEE HAS NATURAL DIVISION ALONG GENERATIONAL LINES.  INFORMATION NOW BEGINNING TO EMERGE ON IDENTITIES OF YOUNGER MILITARY OFFICERS ON COMMITTEE BUT LITTLE IS KNOWN OF THEIR ATTITUDES AND RELATIONSHIPS WITH DAUD AND HIS ""OLD GUARD"". APPARENTLY PRESIDENT DAUD IS MOVING AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE TO PLACE THEM IN POSITIONS OF AUTHORITY IN MILITARY ESTABLISHMENT, BUT IF HISTORY OF MILITARY COUPS ANY GUIDE, ONCE ARMY ENTERS POLITICS, IT RELUCTANT TO RETURN FULL CONTROL TO CIVILIANS. WE THEREFORE REMAIN UNEASY ABOUT DAUDS CONFIDENTIAL  ABILITY EVEN IN SHORT RUN TO PERSUADE ARMY TO RETURN TO BARRACKS.\n4. THERE IS STILL NO RPT NO INFORMATION TO SUPPORT SPECULATION THAT SOVIETS EITHER HAD FOREKNOWLEDGE OR ASSISTED IN COUP ONCE IT BECAME KNOWN. EARLY RECOGNITION NEW REGIME BY USSR EXPLAINABLE BY NATURAL DESIRE NORTHERN NEIGHBOR TO GET OFF ON RIGHT FOOT WITH COUNTRY IN WHICH IT HAS SUBSTANTIAL GEOPOLITICAL INTEREST AND SIZEABLE ECONOMIC TIES, LARGER THAN THAT OF ANY OTHER POWER. ALL WE KNOW FOR CERTAIN IS EMPHATIC ASSERTION OF NEW LEADERS, BOTH DAUD AND NAIM, WHICH WE ACCEPT FOR TIME BEING, THAT THERE WAS NO RPT NO SOVIET INVOLVMENT (NAIM QUOTED SOVIET AMBASSADOR PUZANOV AS SAYING TO DAUD THAT ""EVEN I DID NOT KNOW THIS WAS COMING""). ALSO, JUNIOR OFFICERS PROMINENT IN COUP HAVE BEEN HEARD TO SCORN- FULLY DISMISS ANY RUSSIAN PART. WHETHER THAT IS ACTUALLY TRUE WE MAY NEVER KNOW.\n5. WE ARE INCLINED TO ACCEPT AT FACE VALUE DAUDS AND NAIMS ASSERTIONS THAT THEY ARE INDEPENDET NATIONALISTS AND DO NOT AND WILL NOT FOLLOW RUSSIAN OR ANYBODY ELSES ORDERS. BUT REAL QUESTION IS WHETHER THEIR OWN POLICIES PLAY INTO RUSSIAN HANDS, WHETHER THEY WANT THEM TO OR NOT, THUS BECOMING DESTABILIZING TO THE REGION. PRIOR TO COUP, EMBASSY GENERALLY ACCEPTED THESIS THAT SOVIETS HAD COME TO ACCEPT NON-ALIGNED AFGHAN POSTURE AS COMPATIBLE WITH LONNG-TERM SOVIET INTERESTS, WHICH CALLED FOR  RELATIVELY STABLE (ALBEIT BACKWARD) NEIGHBOR WHICH WOULD DO NOTHING TO DISTURB TRANQUILITY OF REGION, OR GROWING USSR ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL TIES IN THE SUBCONTINENT,AT EXPENSE, AT LEAST  IMPLICITLY IF NOT EXPLICITLY, OF CHINA. WHETHER SOVIET OBJECTIVES HAVE BEEN OTHERWISE, OR HAVE CHANGED, WE CANNOT YET DETERMINE. THERE IS NOT YET ANY DEMONSTRABLE EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT CLAIM THAT SOVIETS WILL HAVE EASIER TIME WITH REFORMIST, AUTHORITARIAN, REPUBLICAN AND POTENTIALLY UNSTABLE AND PREDICTABLE PREDECESSOR GOVERNMENT.\n6. FUTURE AFGHAN RELATIONS WITH PAKISTAN WILL HAVE TO AWAIT SPECIFIC POLICY PRONOUNCMENTS AND ACTIONS OF NEW GOVERNMENT. PRESIDENT DAUD HAS BEEN QUESTIONED CLOSELY BY AMBASSADOR NEUMANN AND DIPLOMATIC COLLEAGUES IN KABUL,AS WELL AS BY FOREIGN JOURNALISTS ON HIS REFERENCE IN JULY 17 SPEECH TO PASHTUNISTAN. DAUD HAS REMAINED VAGUE AS TO HOW HE WISHES TO ""SETTLE"" ISSUE WHICH PAKISTAN CONSIDERS ARTIFICIALLY ENGENDERED, MEDDLESOME AND PROFITLESS TO PURSUE. SOME OBSERVERS HERE BELIEVE HIS PUBLIC REFERENCE TO CONFIDENTIAL  PASHTUNISTAN WAS MADE TO ATTRACT SUPPORT OF SUPERNATIONALISTS FOR REPUBLICAN REGIME IN EARLY DAYS, WHILE OTHERS BELIEVE PREVIOUS REGIMES FAILURE TO TAKE ACTION ON PASHTUNISTAN DURING ""GOLDEN OPPORTUNITIES"" OF 1965 AND 1971 WAS ONE PRIMARY MOTIVATION FOR STAGING COUP. DAUD HAS ALWAYS BEEN POPULAR AMONG ""PASHTUNISTANIS"" BUT UNLIKE PREDECESSOR GOVERNMENTS UNDER DEMOCRATIC EXPERIMENT (WHO KEPT ISSUE ALIVE PURELY FOR DOMESTIC POLITICAL PROPOGANDA PURPOSES), HE MAY BE EXPECTED TO DO SOMETHING MORE. THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT DAUD WAS DEEPLY HUMILIATED BY BEING FORCED TO RETREAT ON PASHTUNISTAN POLICY IN PAST WHEN CLOSURE OF PAK BORDER INFLICTED GREAT HARM ON AFGHANISTAN. THAT THIS CONTRIBUTED TO HIS DOWNFALL IN 1963 MAY GIVE RISE  TO DESIRE FOR ""ANOTHER ROUND""; YET, ONE SHOULD NOT ASSUME THAT A MAN WITH INTELLIGENCE OF DAUD SHOULD HAVE LEARNED NOTHING FROM TEN YEARS OF BROODING EXILE FROM POWER. THUS WE WILL HAVE TO WAIT AND SEE. OTHER THINGS BEING EQUAL, CONTINUED STRONG US PRESENCE HERE CAN BE USEFUL TO MAKE WEIGHT FELT ON DAUD SHOULD HE TURN ON PAKISTAN IN TOO MILITANT A FASHION.\n7. NEW REGIME HAS SAID NOTHING ABOUT RELATIONS WITH IRAN. DAUD HAS SAID PUBLICLY HE WOULD DO NOTHING ABOUT HELMAND WATERS TREATY WITH IRAN (SIGNED BY PREVIOUS GOVERNMENT AND RATIFIED BY PARLIAMENT, BUT NOT BY KING) UNTIL HE HAS HAD CHANCE TO STUDY IT (KABUL 5492). OBSERVERS HERE SPECULATE HE WILL THINK TWICE BEFORE REJECTING IT; WE ARE INCLINED TO AGREE, ESPECIALLY SINCE IT HAS OBVIOUS ECONOMIC BENEFITS FOR COUNTRY. DAUD CAN BE EXPECTED TO RESPOND TO IRANIAN FEARS ABOUT HIS ALLEGED PRO-SOVIET INCLINATIONS WITH GREAT IRRITATION. AFGHANS HAVE ALWAYS RESENTED SHAHS PATERNALISTIC PROFESSIONS OF CONCERN OVER UNDUE SOVIET INFLUENCE IN AFGHAN AFFAIRS; THEY FEEL IRANIAN CONCERN IS NOT ONLY TOTALLY UNJUSTIFIED BUT IS SMOKESCREEN FOR OWN DESIRE TO MEDDLE IN COUNTRYS INTERNAL AFFAIRS. RECENT IMPROVEMENT IN PAK-IRANIAN RELATIO NS IS LIKELY TO BE VIEWED HERE AS EFFORT TO SECURE FURTHER IRANIAN HEGOEMONY IN REGION. WE THEREFORE CONCLUDE THAT, EVEN THOUGH AFGHANISTAN MAY HAVE MORE TO LOSE THAN IRAN OR PAKISTAN IF RELATIONS DETERIORATE WITH EITHER NEIGHBORING POWER, IRANS FEAR OF AFGHANISTAN FALLING INTO SOVIET ORBIT COULD TURN INTO SELF- FULFILLING PROPHECY IF TWO POWERS TOOK ANY JONNT ACTION THAT  COULD BE CONSTRUED AS AIMED AGAINST AFGHANISTAN.\n8. OUTLOOK FOR U.S. RELATIONS WITH NEW REGIME WILL, OF COURSE, BE COLORED BY GOVERNMENTS ABILITY TO CONSOLIDATE POWER AND TO FOCUS DECISIVELY ON PERSONNEL APPOINTMENTS, GOVERNMENT ORGANIZATION AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT POLICY. ON STRICTLY BILATERAL BASIS, THERE IS NO REASON WHY US-AFGHAN RELATIONS CANNOT BE AS GOOD (OR EVEN BETTER) THAN THEY HAVE BEEN IN THE PAST. IF NEW LEADERSHIP REALLY MEANS THEY WISH TO BE NEUTRAL AND INDEPENDENT, THEIR DESIRE FOR SIGNIFICANT AMERICAN PRESENCE SHOULD INCREASE AS SUSPICION OF MOSCOW TIE LINGERS. ON DOMESTIC GROUNDS, TOO, A SIGNIFICANT AMERICAN PRESENCE SHOULD BE IMPORTANT TO THE AFGHANS. THERE WAS OBVIOUSLY NO ENTHUSIASM FOR WEAK AND VACILLATING MONARCHY. BUT BY NO STRETCH OF IMAGINATION CAN ONE DETECT ANY ENTHUSIAMS FOR DAUD; THERE IS RESPECT, PROBABLY FEAR, BUT CERTAINLY NO LOVE. HENCE NEW REGIME WILL HAVE TO PERMORM FAIRLY QUICKLY AND IN WAYS WHICH SHOWN EARLY SIGNS OF IMPROVEMENT FOR COMMON PEOPLE. NAIMS REMARKS TO AMBASSADOR (KABUL 5325) CLEARLY INDICATE THAT NEW GOVERNMENT IS KEENLY AWARE OF THIS PROBLEM. HERE, TOO, US ASSISTANCE WOULD SEEM TO BE IMPORTANT, NOT ONLY FOR ITS SIZE BUT PERHAPS EVEN MORE FOR THE CHARACTER OF OUR TECHNICAL AND MANAGERIAL ADVICE WHICH THE AFGHANS FIND MORE PERTINENT AND DISINTERESTED THAN THAT WHICH COMES FROM OTHER SOURCES. NOW THAT THE ARMY (ESPECIALLY THE YOUNGER OFFICERS) HAVE ENTERED POLITICAL ARENA, FUTURE COUPS ARE DISTINCT POSSIBILITY IF DAUD DOES NOT PRODUCE RESULTS MORE QUICKLY THAN HAS BEEN EVIDENT THUS FAR.\n9. IF THESE INITIAL ASSUMPTIONS PROVE CORRECT -- AND WE SHALL HAVE TO OBSERVE PATIENTLY FOR A WHILE -- THE U.S. HAS IMPORTANT CARDS TO PLAY. IF DAUD GOVERNMENT SOON PROVES TO BE MORE DECISIVE AND EFFECTIVE IN THE ECONOMIC SPHERE THAN MOST OF  GOVERNMENTS OF PAST TEN YEARS (A REAL POSSIBILITY), US  ASSISTANCE CAN BECOME EVEN MORE IMPORTANT TO AFGHANISTAN THAN IN THE PAST. IF, THEN, DAUD WERE TO ENGAGE IN POLICIES TOWARDS HIS NEIGHBORS WHICH WE REGARD AS POTENTIALLY DESTABILIZING AND INIMICAL TO OUR INTERESTS, THE POSSIBILITY OF WITHDRAWAL US ASSISTANCE COULD SERVE AS SOMEWHAT OF A  DETERRRENT, IF SUBTLY BUT FIRMLY PLAYED. USG INTEREST IN SECURING EARLY AND EFFECTIVE AFGHAN COOPERATION ON NARCOTICS CONTROL MEASURES CAN ALSO BE SERVED BY USING ECONOMIC ASSISTANCE CARROT TACTICS. POLITICAL CONSIDERATIONS IN OUR AID EFFORT, THEREFORE, REMAIN IMPORTANT, AS IN THE PAST.\n0. UNTIL SHAPE OF THINGS TO COME EMERGES MORE CLEARLY, WE SHOULD CONTINUE WITH BUSIESS AS USUAL AND LISTEN WITH SYMPATHY AND INTEREST TO NEW PROPOSALS. OUR ACTIONS WILL OF COURSE DEPEND ON THE NATURE OF AFGHANISTANS ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL DIRECTION AS IT EMERGES. AT SAME TIME WE SHOULD COUNSEL AGAINST ALARMIST TALK AND ACTION IN IRAN AND PAKISTAN -- HOWEVER UNDERSTANDAB LE AND POTENTIALLY JUSTIFIABLE. AT THIS TIME BOTH STYLE AND ACTION ARE EQUALLY IMPORTANT.

KABUL GOVERNOR AYEEN CALLED AMBASSADOR SATURDAY, AUGUST\n2. UPON AMBASSADORS ARRIVAL AYEEN SUGGESTED MOVING FROM PORCH OF RESIDENCE TO INTERIOR. AYEEN IMMEDIATELY ASKED AMBASSADOR CONFIDENTIAL  ABOUT HIS JUDGMENT ON DAUD GOVERNMENT. AMBASSADOR INDICATED THAT HE HAD A WAIT AND SEE ATTITUDE, BUT THAT IT APPEARED MAKEUP OF GOVERNMENT WAS WEAK. AYEEN CONCURRED WHOLE-HEARTEDLY AND ASKED IF WE BELIEVED THAT MINISTER OF EDUCATION PAZHWAK WAS MEMBER OF SOVIET-ORIENTED PARCHARM. AMBASSADOR SAID HE AWARE OF THIS STORY, BUT HAD NOT YET REACHED ANY CONCLUSIONS. IN RESPONSE TO QUESTION AYEEN SAID JUNIOR OFFICERS IN CABINET (MINISTERS OF INTERIOR, COMMUNICATIONS AND PUBLIC WORKS) WERE ""CRIMINALS."" IN CLARIFYING THIS SOBRIQUET, HE SAID THEY WERE KNOWN TO HAVE ""MISUSED FUNDS"" IN THEIR FORMER OFFICIAL CAPACITIES. HE SAID THAT THIS LET HIM TO BELIEVE THAT DAUD WAS OPERATING IN THE SAME FASHION AS HE DID DURING HIS PREVIOUS REGIME, GIVING PEOPLE APPOINTMENTS AS REWARDS NOT NECESSARILY ON MERIT AND NOT BECAUSE OF FAMILY OR TRIBAL CONNECTIONS. HE NOTED THAT IT APPEARED SOME OF THESE PEOPLE WANTED TO GET CLOSE TO THE ""STREAM OF GOLD AND SILVER."" AYEEN EXPRESSED FURTHER THAT HE FEARFUL DAUD HAD NOT CHANGED AT ALL SINCE 1963 WHEN HE LEFT OFFICE AND THAT HE HAD SERIOUS CONCERN ABOUT STABILITY OF COUNTRY BECAUSE OF APPARENT SPLITS IN CURRENT LEADERSHIP GROUP.\n3. AYEEN SAID THAT DAUD WAS CARRYING TOO LARGE A WORKLOAD FOR ANY ONE PERSON AND ESPECIALLY ONE OF 64 YEARS OF AGE. HE SAID HE WAS VERY UNEASY BUT COULD NOT SPECIFY WHO MIGHT BE LEADER OF GROUP IN OPPOSITION AT THIS TIME. HE ASKED IF WE THOUGHT THAT THERE WAS SOME NASSER PLAYING A ROLE TO DAUDS NAGUIB. IN RESPONSE TO QUESTIONS CONCERNING REMAINDER OF AFGHANISTAN OUTSIDE OF KABUL AS BEING POSSIBLE SOURCE OF DISCONTENT, AYEEN SAID THAT FORMULATION OF REPUBLIC WAS GENERALLY POPULAR THROUGHOUT COUNTRY. HE SAID THAT POOR PEOPLE OF FARMS AND VILLAGES EQUATED ROYAL FAMILY WITH THEIR POVERTY, MEANNESS OF LIFE, AND WIDE-SPREAD CORRUPTION, AND THEREFORE, SUPPORTED REPUBLIC. THEY WERE NOT NECESSARILY CONCERNED WITH LEADERSHIP OF REPUBLIC BECAUSE ANYTHING WOULD BE AN IMPROVEMENT.\n4. AYEEN SAID THAT ONLY POSSIBLE POLITICAL LEADER WHO COULD PLAY OPPOSITION ROLE AT THIS TIME MIGHT BE FORMER PRIME MINISTER MAIWANDAL. HE SAID THAT MAINWANDAL HAD BEEN ""CALLED BACK FROM ABROAD"" BY DAUD AND IT HAD BEEN BELIEVED THAT HE MIGHT RECEIVE SENIOR POSITION IN NEW GOVERNMENT, POSSIBLY VICE PRESIDENT. AYEEN SAID HE KNEW THAT MAINWANDAL HAD MET WITH DAUD AND HE, AYEEN, SURPRISED THAT MAINWANDAL NOT IN CONFIDENTIAL  GOVERNMENT BUT ASSUMED THAT MAINWANDAL HAD REFUSED APPOINTMENT AS VICE PRESIDENT AS NOT BEING A SIGNIFICANT POSITION.\n5. AYEEN SAID THAT MINISTRY OF DEFENSE WAS AT COMPLETE STAND- STILL BECAUSE LEADERSHIP WAS TOTALLY ABSENT IN VIEW OF FACT THAT CHIEF OF STAFF MUSTAGNI WAS BEING USED BY DAUD AS PERSONAL AND PRIVATE SECRETARY. HE SAID THAT MINISTRY OF DEFENSE WAS NOT EVEN CARRYING OUT IS ROUTINE DAY-TO-DAY TASKS BECAUSE OF THIS LACK OF LEADERSHIP.\n6. AYEEN NOTED THAT HE FELT DAUDS REPLY TO QUESTION CONCERNING HELMAND WATERS TREATY WITH IRAN AT PRESS CONFERENCE IN WHICH DAUD SAID HE HAD NO VIEWS SINCE HE HAD NOT READ TREATY WAS TERRIBLE BLUNDER. AYEEN COMMENTED THAT TREATY WAS NUMBER ONE POLITICAL ISSUE IN COUNTRY PRIOR TO COUP AND FOR ANY LEADER TO HAVE SAID WHAT HE DID INDICATED A WEAKNESS WHICH DAUD COULD NOT AFFORD.\n7. THROUGHOUT CONVERSATION AYEEN RETURNED TO THEME OF WEAKNESS OF CABINET, OBSERVING THAT YOUNG PEOPLE HAVING BEEN GIVEN SENIOR RESPONSIBILITIES WITH NO EXPERIENCE WAS TERRIBLE MISTAKE. HE ASKED IF WE WERE AWARE OF BACKGROUND MINISTER OF  FINANCE. HE WAS INFORMED THAT WERE WERE AWARE AND OBSERVED THAT DISAPPEARANCE OF FOREIGN EXCHANGE FROM PASHTANY TEJARATY BANK WAS RESULT OF INCOMPETENCE RATHER THAN CORRUPTION.\n8. AMBASSADOR NOTED TWICE DURING CONVERSATION THAT USG PRIMARY CONCERN WAS POLICY OF NEW GOVERNMENT WITH REGARD TO ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND FOREIGN AFFAIRS. WE TOOK POSITION THAT CHANGE IN GOVERNMENT WAS INTERNAL AFFAIR OF AFGHANISTAN AND WE WERE PREPARED TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH NEW GOVERNMENT SO LONG AS IT UNDERTOOK THOSE KINDS OF PROGRAMS AND POLICIES WHICH WERE OF BENEFIT TO ENTIRE POPULATION, AND COULD EFFECTIVELY MOVE COUNTRY FORWARD TO IMPROVED QUALITY OF LIFE.\n9. REGARDING HIS PERSONAL SITUATION, AYEEN SAID THAT HE HAD CLEARLY EXPECTED TO BE REMOVED AS GOVERNOR OF KABUL PROVINCE ON MORNING OF COUP. HE SAID SINCE THAT TIME HE HAD MET WITH MEMBERS OF CENTRAL COMMITTEE AND HAD PERSONAL MEETING WITH PRESIDENT DAUD. HE SAID THAT DAUD INDICATED HE NOT PREVIOUSLY KNOWN AYEEN THOUGH AYEEN SAID OVER THE YEARS HE HAD MET WITH CONFIDENTIAL  DAUD NUMBER OF TIMES AND HE KNEW THAT NUMBER OF TRIBAL LEADERS FROM BADAKSHAN, WHERE HE HAD PREVIOUSLY BEEN GOVERNOR, HAD METWITH DAUD AND TOLD DAUD WHAT HE HAD DONE AS GOVERNOR IN THAT PROVINCE. HE SAID THAT HE WAS INSTRUCTED BY DAUD TO RETURN TO HIS WORK AS GOVERNOR AND CONTINUE AS PREVIOUSLY. HE WAS NOT AT ALL CERTAN HOW LONG THIS WOULD LAST. IT HIS PERSONAL WISH THAT HE BE RELIVED AS GOVERNOR IN ORDER TO HAVE A FEW MONTHS TO THINK AND WRITE. HE SAID HE WOULD NOT RESIGN, HOWEVER, SINCE THIS MIGHT BE CONSTRUED TO BE AN EXPRESSION OF DISAPPROVAL OF PRESENT REGIME AND ALSO A SIGNAL THAT HE WAS ""A ROYALIST"". HE SAID THAT HE HAD NEVER BEEN ""A ROYALIST"".\n0. AS AMBASSADORS SUGGESTION HE AGREED THAT AMBASSADOR  SHOULD LEAVEA/DCMS RESIDENCE PRIOR TO HIS DEPARTURE. HE ALSO SAID THAT HE HAD SOUGHT THIS MEETING WITH AMBASSADOR BECAUSE  HE WANTED TO SEE HIM PRIOR TO AMBASSADORS DEPARTURE AND ARRIVAL OF NEW AMBASSADOR BECAUSE THEY WERE SUCH OLD AND CLOSE FRIENDS. SUBSEQUENT TO AMBASSADORS DEPARTURE AYEEN ASKED IF HE COULD TELEPHONE HIS DRIVER AND THIS WAS DONE. AYEEN REMAINED ABOUT 15 MINUTES AFTER AMBASSADORS DEPARTURE AND A/DCM ACCOMPANIED HIM TO GATE. AYEEN WENT THROUGH DOOR IN EXTREMELY FURTIVE MANNER AND WITHOUT LOOKING IMMEDIATELY TURNED TO RIGHT AND SET OFF AT FAST PACE, HIS CAR WAS NOT IN FRONT OF A/DCMS RESIDENCE.\n1. COMMENT: AYEEN IS AN OLD AND HIGHLY REGARDED FRIEND OF THIS EMBASSY. WE BELIEVE HIM TO BE HONEST AND SINCERE REPORTER OF EVENTS AS HE SEES THEM. WE HAVE NO REASON TO BELIEVE HE WAS DISSEMBLING IN ANY MANNER WHATSOEVER, AND THAT HE SINCERELY WISHES TO REVIEW SITUATION WITH US. NEUMANN\n",839977

WITH DAUD COUP NOW TWO WEEKS OLD, PAKISTANIS ARE STILL MAINTAINING RESERVED PUBLIC ATTITUDE. PRIVATELY, HOWEVER, CONSIDERABLE CONCERN IS BEING EXPRESSED ORWQF LIMITED OFFICIAL USE\n2. VIRTUALLY ALL PAK OFFICIALS WITH WHOM WE HAVE DIS- CUSSED AFGHAN DEVELOPMENTS HAVE PROFESSED TO SEE SOVIET HAND IN DAUD COUP. SOME SUGGEST THAT SOVIETS AT MINI- MUM HAD FOREKNOWLEDGE OF COUP AND MUST HAVE GIVEN DUAD AT LEAST TACIT APPROVAL, WHILE OTHER ASSERT THAT WHOLE AFFAIR WAS INTEGRAL PART OF OVERALL INDO-SOVIET CONSPIRACY AGAINST PAKISTAN. ALTHOUGH MOST PAKISTANIS TEND TO SEE DAUD AS DOMINANT FIGURE, A FEW HAVE QUESTIONED WHETHER HE MIGHT NOT BE UNWITTING FRONT MAN FOR YOUNGER ARMY ELEMENT. THUS PAK ARMY COLONEL, IN INFORMAL CHAT WITH POL COUNSELOR, WONDERED ALOUD WHETHER DAUD MIGHT PLAY NAGUIB TO SOME YOUNG COLONELS NASSER.\n3. PAK CONCERNS OVER DAUDS RETURN TO POWER ARE ONLY DIMLY REFLECTED IN PRESS, WHICH PRESUMABLY IS STILL UNDER GOP INSTRUCTIONS TO OBSERVE RESTRAINT. INDEPENDENT DAWN IN JULY 24 EDITORIAL WISHED DAUD REGIME WELL AND SAID THAT PAKS WOULD QTE WATCH WITH SYMPATHY AND UNDER- STANDING UNQTE DAUDS EFFORTS TO MODERNIZE HIS COUNTRY. PAPER WARNED, HOWEVER, THAT NEW REGIME MIGHT QTE SUCCUMB TO THE TEMPTATION OF SEEKING TO DIVERT THE PEOPLE FROM THEIR FRUSTRATION BY RAISING ULTRA-NATIONALIST SLOGANS UNQTE IF IT MET WITH DIFFICULTIES. PRO-GOVERNMENT URDU LANGUAGE TAMEER EXPRESSED CONCERN IN JULY 27 EDITORIAL THAT DUADS POST-COUP PUBLIC COMMENTS SUGGEST HE COULD BE PLANNING TO PURSUE POLICY OF CONFRONTATION WITH PAKISTAN, URGED HIM TO TURN INSTEAD TOWARD IMPROVING ECONOMIC CONDITIONS IN AFGHANISTAN.\n4. FRONT PAGE ARTICLE BY QTE SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT, UNHY IN JULY 27 GOVERNMENT-CONTROLLED PAKISTAN TIMES, DATE- LINED KABUL, REPORTED THAT CORRESPONDENT HAD QUERIED REPRESENTATIVE SAMPLING OF PUSHTU SPEAKERS ON KABUL STREETS IN DAYS FOLLOWING COUP AND HAD FOUND THEM UN- CONCERNED WITH PUSHTUNISTAN ISSUE AND ALL IN FAVOR OF CLOSER RELATIONS WITH PAKISTAN.\n5. SAME ISSUE PAK TIMES CARRIED LONG EDITORIAL PAGE COMMENTARY BY VETERAN COMMENTATOR ABDUL MAJID ON AFGHAN COUP. AUTHOR NOTED WITH CONCERN DAUDS PAST RECORD OF CREATING QTE FIERCEST TENSION UNQTE IN RELATIONS WITH PAKISTAN AND EXPRESSED HOPE IT WOULD NOT BE REPEATED. REVIEWING HIS- TORY OF DEPOSED KING ZAHIRS EXPERIMENT WITH PARLIAMENTARY REGIME, MAJID ATTRIBUTED ITS FAILURE PARTLY TO LACK OF EDUCATION AND ADEQUATE INFRASTRUCTURE IN COUNTRY AND PARTLY TO KINGS INSISTENCE ON RETAINING GREAT PERSONAL POWER WHICH HE HAD FAILED TO USE EFFECTIVELY. AUTHOR POINTED OUT THAT ALTHOUGH SUCCESSIVE AFGHAN GOVERNMENTS HAD PRESSED PUSHATUNISTAN ISSUE, AFGHANISTAN HAD ITS OWN TROUBLED MINORITIES WHOSE FEELINGS OF SEPARATE IDENTITY MIGHT WELL BE STIRRED BY POLICY OF QTE AGGRESSIVE IRREDENTISM UNQTE AGAINST PAKISTAN; HE WARNED THAT ANY SUCH QTE EXPANSIONIST VENTURE UNQTE COULD REBOUND AGAINST AFGHANISTAN.\n6. COMMENT: AS WITH OTHER CASES IN WHICH PAK OFFICIALS PRO- FESS TO SEE SOVIET MACHINATIONS DIRECTED AGAINST THEM, DIFFI- CULT TO TELL HOW COMPLETELY PAKS BELIEVE THEIR OWN ASSERTIONS. IN THIS INSTANCE, LITTTLE DOUBT THAT MOST PAKS ACTUALLY DO SEE SOVIET HAND IN DAUDS COUP. AT SAME TIME, SEEMS EQUALLY APPARENT THAT THEY ARE CONSCIOUSLY STRESSING THIS POINT IN TALKS WITH US OFFICIALS IN HOPES OF IMPRESSING USG WITH THEIR NEED FOR MATERIAL SUPPORT. PAKS ARE ALSO, HOWEVER, CAREFULLY AVOIDING OVERLY DIRECT PUBLIC CHARGES AGAINST SOVIET UNION IN LINE WITH BHUTTO POLICY OF SPEAK- ING SOFTLY ABOUT RUSSIANS NEIGHBORS IN PUBLIC WHILE BE- RATING THEM IN PRIVATE.

HIMSELF AS HEAD WITH TITLE AS YET UNCLEAR2 COUP HAS BEEN GREETED WITH SOME VISIBLE PUBLIC JUBILATION IN KABUL                            THOUGH COMPLETELY UNAWARE OF HOW NEW GOVERNMENT IS TO BE

RELIEF                            THAT INEFFECTIVE AND CORRUPT LEADERSHIP OF KING AND HIS IMMEDIATE FAMILY                            IS ENDED3 AS ANY OBSERVER THIS POLITICALLY FRAGMENTED SOCIETY IS AWARE HOWEVER                            KABUL APPROVAL ALONE DOES NOT MEAN COUNTRY TOTALLY SUPPORTS TAKEOVER                            PRELIMINARY INDICATES ARE THAT CRITICALLY IMPORTANT POSITION OF PASHTUN                            TRIBES IN EAST AND SOUTH IS SUPPORTIVE AND IT APPEARS EXTREMELY UNLIKELY                            THAT DAUD WOULD HAVE ENGINEERED COUP WITHOUT HAVING KNOWN WHICH WAY MANY                            OF THEM WOULD LEAN ON OTHER HAND KING AND ABDULLAH WALI HAVE                            ASSIDUOUSLY CULTIVATED TRIBAL SUPPORT PRIMARILY IN PAKTIA AND KANDAHAR

          RELY AND SO LONG AS KING AND ABDUL WALI REMAINED ALLIED PROSPECTS FOR                            A COUP FROM OTHER OUTSIDERS SEEMED QUITE REMOTE UNTIL TODAY OF                            COURSE4 IT IS LIKELY THEREFORE THAT WIDESPREAD PURGE OF ARMY SOON WILL TAKE                            PLACE AT SAME TIME DAUD AND HIS SUPPORTERS WILL BE MOVING QUICKLY TO                            CONVENE TRIBAL JIRGAHS AND OBTAIN OATHS OF FEALTY FROM AS MANY AS                            POSSIBLE OF KINGS AND ABDUL WALIS TRADITIONAL SUPPORTERS AT PRESENT                            IT WOULD BE DIFFICULT TO ASSESS LIKELIHOOD OF WIDESPREAD TRIBAL REACTION                            AGAINST NEW REGIME BUT IT AT LEAST CONCEIVEABLE THAT OPPOSITION WILL                            CROP UP AND WILL

IN 1963                            PRESUMABLY HE WILL ADOPT STRONG POSITION AGAINST RECENT DIVIDEANDRULE                            TACTICS OF BHUTTO IN NWFP AND                            BALUCHISTAN

IRANIAN PARLIAMENT IF DAUD SHOULD BOW TO                            NATIONALIST TREATY THEN HE MIGHT SCRAP IT ON OTHER HAND IF HE PURSUES                            MILITANT POLICY ON PASHTUNISTAN HE MIGHT BE INCLINED TO SUPPORT TREATY                            TO OBTAIN POTENTIAL OF ALTERNATIVE POTENTIAL BENEFIT OF ACCESS TO SEA                            THROUGH IRAN7 WE CAUTION ADDRESSEES TO TAKE NOTE OF VERY PRELIMINARY NATURE THIS                            ASSESSMENT AFTER 10 YEARS OUT OF POWER DAUD HAS HAD AMPLE TIME TO                            REFLECT ON HIS PAST PERFORMANCE AS HEAD OF GOVERNMENT TO REVIEW                            STRENGTHS AND WEAKNESSES OF HIS RECORD AND TO PLAN PERHAPS FOR MAJOR                            CHANGES AND DEPARTURES FROM HIS PREVIOUS POLICIES IT ALSO POSSIBLE IN                            VIEW DAUDS AGE AND INITIALLY WEAK POLITICAL POSITION THAT AFTER 10                            YEARS OF RELATIVE FREEDOM HE WOULD NEITHER BE ABLE TO IMPOSE NOR WOULD AFGHAN SOCIETY ACCEPT SO                            EASILY HIS HIGHHANDED AUTHORITARIAN METHODS OF 10 YEARS AGO AND THAT                            1 HE MAY HAVE TO SHARE POWER TO GREATER EXTENT THAN HE WOULD OTHERWISE                            PREFER OR 2 HE MAY BE FORCED TO PURSUE POLICY ON ALL FRONTS DURING                            PERIOD OF CONSOLIDATION HIS PERSONAL

                        ASSISTANCE I GAVE HIM FIGURES OF OUR FY1973 AID PROGRAM CITING                            ESPECIALLY OUR RECENT MASSIVE FERTILIZER PROGRAM WHICH WAS ALREADY

INDICATED APPRECIATION FOR                            MY VIEW AND SAID WHEN DAUD WAS PREVIOUSLY PM HE WAS ALSO IN CHARGE OF PLANNING HE INDICATED THAT                            DAUD WOULD CONTINUE TO PLAY THAT ROLE HE URGED ME THEREFORE TO SEE                            PRESIDENT DAUD AS SOON AS POSSIBLE9 WITH REGARD TO NAIMS REMARKS                            ON PREVIOUS REGIMESRELIANCE ON

MANY YEARS WOULD ULTIMATELY REACT TO RECENT EVENTSHE REPLIED THAT                            RECENT EVENTS PROVED THAT HE HAS LITTLE POPULAR SUPPORT SINCE NO ONE                            STOOD UP AND FOUGHT FOR HIM WHAT HE DOES IS HIS OWN BUSINESS BUT WE                            WILL TOLERATE ABSOLUTELY NO FOREIGN INTERFERENCE I TOLD HIM OF                            SPECULATION THAT SOVIETS KNEW ABOUT COUP IN ADVANCE AND MIGHT EVEN HAVE                            ENCOURAGED MOVE NAIM REPLIED                            LET ME SPEAK COMPLETELY FRANKLY AND AS ONE GENTLEMAN TO ANOTHER

                           SINGLING OUT PAKISTAN IN HIS SPEECH AS ONLY FOREIGN POLICY PROBLEM OF                            AFGHANISTAN I SAID THAT WHILE I HAD EXPECTED MENTION OF PASHTUNISTAN I

   AFGHANS WHO HAD BEEN A BIT FEARFUL ABOUT PREVIOUS REGIME WERE                            CONCERNED AS WE WERE THAT THERE WOULD BE LESS PERSONAL CONTACT BETWEEN                            AFGHANS AND FOREIGNERS UNDER NEW REGIME HE REPLIED THERE WILL                            INEVITABLY BE LESS CONTACT INITIALLY SINCE OUR FIRST PRIORITY IS TO GET                            NEW GOVERNMENT

IT NOW CLEAR THAT JULY 17 COUP WAS EXECUTED BY SMALL NUMBER JUNIOR OFFICERS, PERHAPS AS FEW AS 15 LIEUTENANTS AND CAPTAINS AND 300 OR FEWER ORDINARY SOLDIERS. INDICATIONS ARE THAT NEW REGIMES LEADERSHIP, FAR FROM HAVING PRECONCEIVED PROGRAM OF ACTION, HAD CONCENTRATED UNTIL JULY 17 SOLELY ON SEIZURE OF POWER. NEW GOVERNMENT MADE STRONG INITIAL EFFORT TO PRESENTPOSTURE OF CONFIDENCE, VITALITY AND BUREAUCRATIC CONTINUITY, BUT THESE WERE PRIMARILY COSMETICS DESIGNED TO ASSURE A SHOCKED POPULACE AND TO GAIN DIPLOMATIC RECOGNITION FROM WORLD.\n2.EXTENT TO WHICH ESSENTIAL GOVERNMENT SERVICES (CMMUNICATIONS, POLICE, TRAVEL) HAVE BEEN RESUMED IS ENCOURAGING; BUT CONTINUATION OF POSITIVE ACTIVITIES PREVIOUS REGIME IS UNDERGOING NOTICEABLE SLOWDOWN. OBVIOUS LACK OF POSTCOUP PLANNING PERHAPS EXPLAINABLE SIMPLY BECAUSE PLOTTERS DID NOT EXPECT TO SUCCEED SO EASILY; HOWEVER IT ALSO LIKELY THAT (AS DATT HAS REPORTED IR-6-800-0155-\n3. NEW REGIMES LEADERSHIP IN CENTRAL COMMITTEE HAS NATURAL DIVISION ALONG GENERATIONAL LINES.  INFORMATION NOW BEGINNING TO EMERGE ON IDENTITIES OF YOUNGER MILITARY OFFICERS ON COMMITTEE BUT LITTLE IS KNOWN OF THEIR ATTITUDES AND RELATIONSHIPS WITH DAUD AND HIS ""OLD GUARD"". APPARENTLY PRESIDENT DAUD IS MOVING AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE TO PLACE THEM IN POSITIONS OF AUTHORITY IN MILITARY ESTABLISHMENT, BUT IF HISTORY OF MILITARY COUPS ANY GUIDE, ONCE ARMY ENTERS POLITICS, IT RELUCTANT TO RETURN FULL CONTROL TO CIVILIANS. WE THEREFORE REMAIN UNEASY ABOUT DAUDS CONFIDENTIAL  ABILITY EVEN IN SHORT RUN TO PERSUADE ARMY TO RETURN TO BARRACKS.\n4. THERE IS STILL NO RPT NO INFORMATION TO SUPPORT SPECULATION THAT SOVIETS EITHER HAD FOREKNOWLEDGE OR ASSISTED IN COUP ONCE IT BECAME KNOWN. EARLY RECOGNITION NEW REGIME BY USSR EXPLAINABLE BY NATURAL DESIRE NORTHERN NEIGHBOR TO GET OFF ON RIGHT FOOT WITH COUNTRY IN WHICH IT HAS SUBSTANTIAL GEOPOLITICAL INTEREST AND SIZEABLE ECONOMIC TIES, LARGER THAN THAT OF ANY OTHER POWER. ALL WE KNOW FOR CERTAIN IS EMPHATIC ASSERTION OF NEW LEADERS, BOTH DAUD AND NAIM, WHICH WE ACCEPT FOR TIME BEING, THAT THERE WAS NO RPT NO SOVIET INVOLVMENT (NAIM QUOTED SOVIET AMBASSADOR PUZANOV AS SAYING TO DAUD THAT ""EVEN I DID NOT KNOW THIS WAS COMING""). ALSO, JUNIOR OFFICERS PROMINENT IN COUP HAVE BEEN HEARD TO SCORN- FULLY DISMISS ANY RUSSIAN PART. WHETHER THAT IS ACTUALLY TRUE WE MAY NEVER KNOW.\n5. WE ARE INCLINED TO ACCEPT AT FACE VALUE DAUDS AND NAIMS ASSERTIONS THAT THEY ARE INDEPENDET NATIONALISTS AND DO NOT AND WILL NOT FOLLOW RUSSIAN OR ANYBODY ELSES ORDERS. BUT REAL QUESTION IS WHETHER THEIR OWN POLICIES PLAY INTO RUSSIAN HANDS, WHETHER THEY WANT THEM TO OR NOT, THUS BECOMING DESTABILIZING TO THE REGION. PRIOR TO COUP, EMBASSY GENERALLY ACCEPTED THESIS THAT SOVIETS HAD COME TO ACCEPT NON-ALIGNED AFGHAN POSTURE AS COMPATIBLE WITH LONNG-TERM SOVIET INTERESTS, WHICH CALLED FOR  RELATIVELY STABLE (ALBEIT BACKWARD) NEIGHBOR WHICH WOULD DO NOTHING TO DISTURB TRANQUILITY OF REGION, OR GROWING USSR ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL TIES IN THE SUBCONTINENT,AT EXPENSE, AT LEAST  IMPLICITLY IF NOT EXPLICITLY, OF CHINA. WHETHER SOVIET OBJECTIVES HAVE BEEN OTHERWISE, OR HAVE CHANGED, WE CANNOT YET DETERMINE. THERE IS NOT YET ANY DEMONSTRABLE EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT CLAIM THAT SOVIETS WILL HAVE EASIER TIME WITH REFORMIST, AUTHORITARIAN, REPUBLICAN AND POTENTIALLY UNSTABLE AND PREDICTABLE PREDECESSOR GOVERNMENT.\n6. FUTURE AFGHAN RELATIONS WITH PAKISTAN WILL HAVE TO AWAIT SPECIFIC POLICY PRONOUNCMENTS AND ACTIONS OF NEW GOVERNMENT. PRESIDENT DAUD HAS BEEN QUESTIONED CLOSELY BY AMBASSADOR NEUMANN AND DIPLOMATIC COLLEAGUES IN KABUL,AS WELL AS BY FOREIGN JOURNALISTS ON HIS REFERENCE IN JULY 17 SPEECH TO PASHTUNISTAN. DAUD HAS REMAINED VAGUE AS TO HOW HE WISHES TO ""SETTLE"" ISSUE WHICH PAKISTAN CONSIDERS ARTIFICIALLY ENGENDERED, MEDDLESOME AND PROFITLESS TO PURSUE. SOME OBSERVERS HERE BELIEVE HIS PUBLIC REFERENCE TO CONFIDENTIAL  PASHTUNISTAN WAS MADE TO ATTRACT SUPPORT OF SUPERNATIONALISTS FOR REPUBLICAN REGIME IN EARLY DAYS, WHILE OTHERS BELIEVE PREVIOUS REGIMES FAILURE TO TAKE ACTION ON PASHTUNISTAN DURING ""GOLDEN OPPORTUNITIES"" OF 1965 AND 1971 WAS ONE PRIMARY MOTIVATION FOR STAGING COUP. DAUD HAS ALWAYS BEEN POPULAR AMONG ""PASHTUNISTANIS"" BUT UNLIKE PREDECESSOR GOVERNMENTS UNDER DEMOCRATIC EXPERIMENT (WHO KEPT ISSUE ALIVE PURELY FOR DOMESTIC POLITICAL PROPOGANDA PURPOSES), HE MAY BE EXPECTED TO DO SOMETHING MORE. THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT DAUD WAS DEEPLY HUMILIATED BY BEING FORCED TO RETREAT ON PASHTUNISTAN POLICY IN PAST WHEN CLOSURE OF PAK BORDER INFLICTED GREAT HARM ON AFGHANISTAN. THAT THIS CONTRIBUTED TO HIS DOWNFALL IN 1963 MAY GIVE RISE  TO DESIRE FOR ""ANOTHER ROUND""; YET, ONE SHOULD NOT ASSUME THAT A MAN WITH INTELLIGENCE OF DAUD SHOULD HAVE LEARNED NOTHING FROM TEN YEARS OF BROODING EXILE FROM POWER. THUS WE WILL HAVE TO WAIT AND SEE. OTHER THINGS BEING EQUAL, CONTINUED STRONG US PRESENCE HERE CAN BE USEFUL TO MAKE WEIGHT FELT ON DAUD SHOULD HE TURN ON PAKISTAN IN TOO MILITANT A FASHION.\n7. NEW REGIME HAS SAID NOTHING ABOUT RELATIONS WITH IRAN. DAUD HAS SAID PUBLICLY HE WOULD DO NOTHING ABOUT HELMAND WATERS TREATY WITH IRAN (SIGNED BY PREVIOUS GOVERNMENT AND RATIFIED BY PARLIAMENT, BUT NOT BY KING) UNTIL HE HAS HAD CHANCE TO STUDY IT (KABUL 5492). OBSERVERS HERE SPECULATE HE WILL THINK TWICE BEFORE REJECTING IT; WE ARE INCLINED TO AGREE, ESPECIALLY SINCE IT HAS OBVIOUS ECONOMIC BENEFITS FOR COUNTRY. DAUD CAN BE EXPECTED TO RESPOND TO IRANIAN FEARS ABOUT HIS ALLEGED PRO-SOVIET INCLINATIONS WITH GREAT IRRITATION. AFGHANS HAVE ALWAYS RESENTED SHAHS PATERNALISTIC PROFESSIONS OF CONCERN OVER UNDUE SOVIET INFLUENCE IN AFGHAN AFFAIRS; THEY FEEL IRANIAN CONCERN IS NOT ONLY TOTALLY UNJUSTIFIED BUT IS SMOKESCREEN FOR OWN DESIRE TO MEDDLE IN COUNTRYS INTERNAL AFFAIRS. RECENT IMPROVEMENT IN PAK-IRANIAN RELATIO NS IS LIKELY TO BE VIEWED HERE AS EFFORT TO SECURE FURTHER IRANIAN HEGOEMONY IN REGION. WE THEREFORE CONCLUDE THAT, EVEN THOUGH AFGHANISTAN MAY HAVE MORE TO LOSE THAN IRAN OR PAKISTAN IF RELATIONS DETERIORATE WITH EITHER NEIGHBORING POWER, IRANS FEAR OF AFGHANISTAN FALLING INTO SOVIET ORBIT COULD TURN INTO SELF- FULFILLING PROPHECY IF TWO POWERS TOOK ANY JONNT ACTION THAT  COULD BE CONSTRUED AS AIMED AGAINST AFGHANISTAN.\n8. OUTLOOK FOR U.S. RELATIONS WITH NEW REGIME WILL, OF COURSE, BE COLORED BY GOVERNMENTS ABILITY TO CONSOLIDATE POWER AND TO FOCUS DECISIVELY ON PERSONNEL APPOINTMENTS, GOVERNMENT ORGANIZATION AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT POLICY. ON STRICTLY BILATERAL BASIS, THERE IS NO REASON WHY US-AFGHAN RELATIONS CANNOT BE AS GOOD (OR EVEN BETTER) THAN THEY HAVE BEEN IN THE PAST. IF NEW LEADERSHIP REALLY MEANS THEY WISH TO BE NEUTRAL AND INDEPENDENT, THEIR DESIRE FOR SIGNIFICANT AMERICAN PRESENCE SHOULD INCREASE AS SUSPICION OF MOSCOW TIE LINGERS. ON DOMESTIC GROUNDS, TOO, A SIGNIFICANT AMERICAN PRESENCE SHOULD BE IMPORTANT TO THE AFGHANS. THERE WAS OBVIOUSLY NO ENTHUSIASM FOR WEAK AND VACILLATING MONARCHY. BUT BY NO STRETCH OF IMAGINATION CAN ONE DETECT ANY ENTHUSIAMS FOR DAUD; THERE IS RESPECT, PROBABLY FEAR, BUT CERTAINLY NO LOVE. HENCE NEW REGIME WILL HAVE TO PERMORM FAIRLY QUICKLY AND IN WAYS WHICH SHOWN EARLY SIGNS OF IMPROVEMENT FOR COMMON PEOPLE. NAIMS REMARKS TO AMBASSADOR (KABUL 5325) CLEARLY INDICATE THAT NEW GOVERNMENT IS KEENLY AWARE OF THIS PROBLEM. HERE, TOO, US ASSISTANCE WOULD SEEM TO BE IMPORTANT, NOT ONLY FOR ITS SIZE BUT PERHAPS EVEN MORE FOR THE CHARACTER OF OUR TECHNICAL AND MANAGERIAL ADVICE WHICH THE AFGHANS FIND MORE PERTINENT AND DISINTERESTED THAN THAT WHICH COMES FROM OTHER SOURCES. NOW THAT THE ARMY (ESPECIALLY THE YOUNGER OFFICERS) HAVE ENTERED POLITICAL ARENA, FUTURE COUPS ARE DISTINCT POSSIBILITY IF DAUD DOES NOT PRODUCE RESULTS MORE QUICKLY THAN HAS BEEN EVIDENT THUS FAR.\n9. IF THESE INITIAL ASSUMPTIONS PROVE CORRECT -- AND WE SHALL HAVE TO OBSERVE PATIENTLY FOR A WHILE -- THE U.S. HAS IMPORTANT CARDS TO PLAY. IF DAUD GOVERNMENT SOON PROVES TO BE MORE DECISIVE AND EFFECTIVE IN THE ECONOMIC SPHERE THAN MOST OF  GOVERNMENTS OF PAST TEN YEARS (A REAL POSSIBILITY), US  ASSISTANCE CAN BECOME EVEN MORE IMPORTANT TO AFGHANISTAN THAN IN THE PAST. IF, THEN, DAUD WERE TO ENGAGE IN POLICIES TOWARDS HIS NEIGHBORS WHICH WE REGARD AS POTENTIALLY DESTABILIZING AND INIMICAL TO OUR INTERESTS, THE POSSIBILITY OF WITHDRAWAL US ASSISTANCE COULD SERVE AS SOMEWHAT OF A  DETERRRENT, IF SUBTLY BUT FIRMLY PLAYED. USG INTEREST IN SECURING EARLY AND EFFECTIVE AFGHAN COOPERATION ON NARCOTICS CONTROL MEASURES CAN ALSO BE SERVED BY USING ECONOMIC ASSISTANCE CARROT TACTICS. POLITICAL CONSIDERATIONS IN OUR AID EFFORT, THEREFORE, REMAIN IMPORTANT, AS IN THE PAST.\n0. UNTIL SHAPE OF THINGS TO COME EMERGES MORE CLEARLY, WE SHOULD CONTINUE WITH BUSIESS AS USUAL AND LISTEN WITH SYMPATHY AND INTEREST TO NEW PROPOSALS. OUR ACTIONS WILL OF COURSE DEPEND ON THE NATURE OF AFGHANISTANS ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL DIRECTION AS IT EMERGES. AT SAME TIME WE SHOULD COUNSEL AGAINST ALARMIST TALK AND ACTION IN IRAN AND PAKISTAN -- HOWEVER UNDERSTANDAB LE AND POTENTIALLY JUSTIFIABLE. AT THIS TIME BOTH STYLE AND ACTION ARE EQUALLY IMPORTANT.

FOLLOWING IS SUMMARY OF PRESIDENT BHUTTOS ADDRESS TO NATIONAL ASSEMBLY EVENING JULY 9 IN SUPPORT OF RESOLUTION APPROVING RECOGNITION OF BANGLADESH BY GOP WHEN IT FINDS SUCH RECOGNITION IN NATIONAL INTEREST. (TEXT OF RESOLUTION AND DESCRIPTION ASSEMBLY ACTION REPORTED SEPTELS).\n2. PRESIDENT OPENED BY IDENTIFYING A ""DURABLE PEACE IN THE SUBCONTINENT"" AS ALL-IMPORTANT GOAL OF HIS GOVERNMENT. AFTER 1971 WAR, HE NOTED, TWO COURSES WERE OPEN TO GOP. ""WE COULD EITHER PARADE OUR WOUNDS, WALLOW IN MORBIDITY AND DREAM OF REVANCHIST POLICIES WHICH WOULD PROVE UTTERLY FUTILE OR, AS A SPIRITED AND HEALTHY PEOPLE, WE COULD ATTEND TO OUR RECONSTRUCTION, ESTABLISH NORMAL RELATIONS WITH OUR NEIGHBORS, BREAK OUR ISOLATION FROM THOSE WHO WERE OUR COMPATRIOTS AND SO STRENGTHEN OURSELVES POLITICALLY, SOCIALLY AND ECONOMICALLY"". GOP, HE SAID, CHOSE LATTER COURSE. UNCLASSIFIED 3. BHUTTO THEN REVIEWED INITIATIVES HIS GOVERNMENT HAD TAKEN TOWARD PEACE SINCE 1971 WAR, FROM RELEASE OF MUJIB TO CONVENING OF SIMLA CONFERENCE. HE OBSERVED THAT PAKISTANIS HAD LEFT SIMLA IN STATE OF MIXED HOPE AND APPREHENSION. ""THE APPREHENSION EXISTED BECAUSE OF OUR EXPERIENCE OF A QUARTER CENTURY. IT IS NOT AGREEMENTS WHICH MATTER SO MUCH AS THE WILL AND THE ATTITUDE BEHIND THEM. PEACE IS UNATTAINABLE WITHOUT MUTUAL GOODWILL.. THE FIRST ESSENTIAL IN THE NORMALIZATION OF RELATIONS IS A CONSTANCY OF COMMUNICATION BETWEEN THE TWO SIDES"". SUMMARIZING DEVELOPMENTS SUBSEQUENT TO SIMLA, PRESIDENT NOTED THAT POW ISSUE EMERGED AS BIGGEST OBSTACLE TO NORMALIZATION.\n4. APRIL 17 DECLARATION FROM DELHI "" HAD MANY IMPLICATIONS WHICH REQUIRED CLARIFICATION"", PRESIDENT CONTINUED. IN PARTICULAR, IT REQUIRED PAKISTAN TO AGREE TO WAR CRIMES TRIALS OF POWS, ""A CONDITION WE COULD NOT POSSIBLY ACCEPT"". QUESTION WAS NOT ONLY ONE OF LEGAL COMPETENCE BUT OF NATIONAL SOVEREIGNTY AND WHETHER PARTIES CONCERNED WISHED TO PROLONG THEIR DISPUTE OR WORK TOWARD RECONCILIATION. ""HOW CAN ANYONE DENY THAT ENORMOUS WRONGS WERE COMMITTED ON ALL SIDES IN THE TRAGIC CONFLICT OF 1971? WERE WE TO EMBARK ON THEIR EXAMINATION IN A REVANCHIST SPIRIT, BITTER- NESS WOULD SWEEP THE WHOLE AREA AND WOUNDS WOULD BE RE-OPENED WHICH WE WANT TO HEAL. I HAVE SAID PLAINLY THAT, IF THESE TRIALS ARE HELD IN DACCA, AN IRREPARABLE DAMAGE WILL BE CAUSED TO THE FABRIC OF PEACE WHICH, NO ONE CAN DENY, IS STILL FRAGILE"".\n5. PRESIDENT THEN REVIEWED GOP STAND ON QUESTION OF TRANSFERRING OF BIHARIS TO PAKISTAN, NOTING THAT ""THIS IS A MATTER WHICH REQUIRES CAREFUL EXAMINATION IN A HUMANE SPIRIT"". "" I WOULD NOT FORECLOSE ANY WORKABLE SOLUTION"", HE SAID, ""BUT NO SOLUTION WILL BE WORKABLE IF IT DOES NOT TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE PHYSICAL, ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL CONSEQUENCES FOR THE LIFE AND FUTURE FOR THE HUMAN BEINGS INVOLVED... I CANNOT AGREE TO A SIMPLISTIC AND SLOGANIZED APPROACH"" TO THIS ISSUE. PRESIDENT SAW NO PROBLEM WHATSOEVER IN REPATRIATION OF BENGALEES IN PAKISTAN. HE DECLARED THAT ""IT HAS YIELDED US NO HAPPINESS THAT UNCLASSIFIED WE WERE FORCED TO RESTRICT THEIR FREEDOM OF MOVEMENT UNTIL THE DAY THEIR REPATRIATION COULD TAKE PLACE IN AN ORDERLY MANNER"".\n6. GOP RESPONSE TO APRIL 17 STATEMENT WAS TO SUGGEST INDO-PAK DIALOGUE, PRESIDENT CONTINUED. ESSENTIAL ELEMENT IN ACHIEVING PEACE MUST BE CLARIFICATION OF GOP ATTITUDE TOWARD FORMER EAST PAKISTAN. ""IT CANNOT BUT BE A PAINFUL DECISION FOR ANYONE IN PAKISTAN TO ACCEPT IT AS A SEPARATE ENTITY"", PRESIDENT DECLARED. YET ""WE CANNOT INTERFERE IN THE AFFAIRS OF THOSE WHO CONSTITUTED THE MAJORITY OF PAKISTAN FAR LESS TRY TO IMPOSE OUR WILL ON THEM.. WE MUST SHOW THAT WE ARE PREPARED TO ACCEPT THE CHANGED REALITIES OF 1971"". PRESIDENT THEREFORE WANTED ASSEMBLY TO AUTHORIZE HIM TO RECOGNIZE BANGLADESH ""AT A TIME WHICH THE GOVERNMENT MAY CONSIDER APPROPRIATE"".\n7. PRESENT TIME WAS NOT APPROPRIATE, PRESIDENT SAID, WITH POWS STILL IN CAPTIVITY AND TALKS OF TRIALS IN DACCA. GOP WAS, HOWEVER, PREPARED TO ATTEMPT UNFREEZE THE SITUATION. ""WE ARE PREPARED TO COOPERATE IN ARRANGE- MENTS FOR THE REPATRIATION OF ALL THE BENGALEES WHO WISH TO LEAVE PAKISTAN, ENTER INTO DISCUSSIONS REGARDING THE INTERNATIONAL EFFORT TO ALLEVIATE THE PLIGHT OF THE MINORITIES IN BANGLADESH AND EXTEND RECOGNITION TO BANGLADESH"". ALL THAT WAS REQUIRED FROM OTHER SIDE WAS COMPLIANCE WITH GENEVA CONVENTIONS AND SECURITY COUNCIL RESOLUTION 307 AND ABANDONMENT OF WAR CRIMES TRIALS.\n8. ""PEACE CANNOT BE ESTABLISHED BY ANY EVASION OF REALITIES"", PRESIDENT SAID. WITH REGARD BANGLADESH, ""THE PRIMARY REALITY FOR US IS THE EXISTENCE OF A LARGE MUSLIM NATIONAL COMMUNITY COMBINED WITH US UNDER SINGLE SOVEREIGNTY BUT WHICH HAS ESTABLISHED ITS OWN STATEHOOD\n9. PRESIDENT OBSERVED THAT RECOGNITION WOULD ORDINARILY BE SOLELY AN EXECUTIVE RESPONSIBILITY BUT, IN VIEW EXTRAORDINARY CIRCUMSTANCES, GOP HAD DETERMINED OBTAIN BOTH ASSEMBLY APPROVAL AND SUPREME COURT OPINION.\n0. TURNING AGAIN TO QUESTION OF NEGOTIATIONS, BHUTTO STRESSED THAT GOP COULD NOT AGREE TO ""HUMILIATING TERMS"". OR TO ACCEPTANCE OF ""INDIAS DOMINANCE IN SOUTH ASIA."" AT SAME TIME, GOP WAS CONVINCED THAT ""A FAIR, HONORABLE LASTING PEACE IN THE SUBCONTINENT"" WAS ESSENTIAL TO ALL. MOST ESPECIALLY, PEACE WAS NECESSARY FOR THE POOR PEOPLE OF THE SUBCONTINENT AND FOR THE YOUTH, WHO ""HAVE NOT KNOWN THE PLENITUDE OF PROGRESS WHICH ONLY REAL PEACE CAN INSURE"". PRESIDENT PLEDGED THAT GOP WOULD DO WHATEVER IT COULD TO BRING ABOUT PEACE IN SUBCONTINENT WITHOUT ABDICATING PAKISTANS RIGHTS AND INTERESTS. ""IT IS UNCLASSIFIED MY HOPE"", HE SAID, ""THAT BOTH INDIA AND BANGLADESH WILL RECIPROCATE THIS SPIRIT OF OURS. IF THEY DO, THEY WILL RESPOND TO THE CALL OF THE CONTEMPORARY AGE. IT IS AN AGE OF DETENTE AND RECONCILIATION, NOT OF BELLIGERENCY AND STRIFE. IT IS AN AGE WHEN THE NEW GENERATION ALL OVER THE WORLD HAS REJECTED THE PHILOSOPHIES OF HATE. THOSE WHO FOUGHT EACH OTHER AT STALINGRAD ARE NOW ENGAGED IN DIALOGUE OF PEACE. THOSE WHO CONSIDERED EACH OTHERS IDEOLOGY ANATHEMA ARE NOW RESOLVED TO PURSUE THE PATHS OF PEACEFUL CO-EXISTENCE AND MUTUAL NON-INTERFERENCE. SURELY, WHAT DIVIDES INDIA AND PAKISTAN IS NOT SOMETHING MORE THAN WHAT DIVIDED THE SOVIET UNION AND GERMANY OR THE UNITED STATES AND THE SOVIET UNION OR CHINA AND THE UNITED STATES. SURELY, AN ANTAGONISM BETWEEN PAKISTAN AND INDIA IS NOT INHERENT IN THEIR VERY EXISTENCE. I SAY TO MY PEOPLE AS I WOULD SAY TO THE PEOPLE OF INDIA: DO NOT BE SWORN TO ETERNAL HOSITILITY AGAINST EACH OTHER, IF YOU DO, ONLY YOUR COMMON ENEMY, WHICH IS SQUALOR AND POVERTY, WILL TRIUMPH. IT IS TIME FOR THE PEOPLES OF THE SUBCONTINENT TO MOUNT A CHALLENGE AND GIVE BATTLE TO THAT REAL FOE."" SOBER\n",843942

RWANDAN DELEGATION, LED BY FORMER AMBASSADOR TO BUJUMBURA IGNACE KAHURIJE AND INCLUDING TWO MILITARY OFFICERS, CALLED ON FOREIGN MINISTER VAN ELSLANDE JULY 17 TO EXPLAIN THE REASONS BEHIND THE COUP DETAT. FONOFF TELLS US THAT KAHURIJE ESSENTIALLY REPEATED WHAT HABYALIMANA HAD ALREADY TOLD THE BELGIAN AMBASSADOR IN KIGALI, GIVING ASSURANCES WITH REGARD TO MAINTAINING GOOD RELATIONS WITH BELGIUM AND RESPECTING INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENTS. WHEN BELGIANS WERE ASKED FOR THEIR OPINION OF THE COUP, THEY REPLIED THAT THEY HAD NO OPINION ON WHAT WAS AN INTERNAL RWANDAN MATTER AND THAT THERE WAS NO PROBLEM OF RECOGNITION SINCE BELGIUM RECOGNIZES STATES RATHER THAN GOVERNMENTS. (IN THIS CONNECTION, FONOFF OFFICIAL ASKED EMBOFF WHAT US POSITION ON RECOGNITION WILL BE EMBOFF REPLIED THAT WE HAD NOT YET SEEN DEPARTMENT INSTRUCTIONS LIMITED OFFICIAL USE\n2. KAHURIJE GAVE A PRESS CONFERENCE AT THE RWANDAN EMBASSY AND SAID THE FOLLOWING IN RESPONSE TO QUESTIONS. THE ARMY WILL KEEP POWER UNTIL IT IS JUDGED THAT DEMOCRATIC ELECTIONS CAN BE ORGANIZED. IN THE MEANTIME CIVILIANS WILL PARTICIPATE IN GOVERNING THE COUNTRY. THE COUP WAS MADE NECESSARY BECAUSE OF THE EXTREME DANGER ARISING FROM ""EXACERBATED REGIONALISM"" AND WAS NOT INSTIGATED OUT OF PERSONAL AMBITION ON THE PART OF COUP LEADERS. KAYIBANDA, WHO RENDERED GREAT SERVICE BUT WAS NEVERTHELESS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE POLITICAL DETERIORATION OF THE COUNTRY, IS PRESENTLY IN A VILLA IN THE INTERIOR. WITH RESPECT TO RELATIONS WITH BURUNDI, ""THE CONCEPTION AND THE ORIENTATION OF THE TWO COUNTRIES REMAIN DIFFERENT"".\n3.

REMOVAL OF TENSIONS,  SOLUTION OF DISPUTES AND GENERAL IMPROVEMENT IN RELATIONS BETWEEN PAKISTAN AND INDIA WOULD SEEM,  I SAID,  TO OFFER GREATEST SECURITY.  BHUTTO SAID HE AGREED AND HE WANTED TO     SECRET      CONTINUE ON SIMLA COURSE.  STILL,  HE REMARKED,  PAKISTAN NEEDED TO STAND ON ITS OWN FEET.  HAVING AN ADEQUATELY STRONG DEFENSIVE POSTURE WOULD COMPLEMENT GOP S PEACE-  MAKING EFFORT.  AS FOR INDIANS,  HE WENT ON,  THEY WOULD GRIPE FOR SOME TIME IF US RESTORED MILITARY AID TO PAKISTAN,  BUT AFTER A WHILE THEY WOULD ACCOMMODATE TO THE FACT.  I EXPRESSED UNCERTAINTY AS TO HIS JUDGMENT ON THAT MATTER,  NOTING THAT GOI SEEMED TO PLACE MAXIMU IMPORTANCE ON OUR MILITARY RELATIONSHIP WITH PAKIST,.  BHUTTO RESPONDED THAT,  ALTHOUGH HE HAD NOT THOUGHT MATTER THROUGH AND DID NOT WISH COMMIT HIMSELF AT THIS MOMENT,  PRESUMED EFFECT ON INDIA OF REINSTITUTION OF US MILITARY AID TO PAKISTAN MIGHT BE MITIGATED BY HIS SUGGESTING A KIND OF "" NO WAR""  PACT. \n6.  OUR DISCUSSION THIS SUBJECT ENDED WITH MY REMARK THAT I WOULD REPORT CONVERSATION PROMPTLY,  TAKING SPECIAL NOTE OF CLARIFICATION BHUTTO HAD GIVEN WITH REGARD AZIZ AHMED S EARLIER STATEMENTS TO ME. \n7.  COMMENT:  IN REFTEL I HAD SPECULATED ( CORRECTLY,  AS IT TURNS OUT)  THAT BHUTTO MIGHT TAKE SOMEWHAT SOFTER LINE THAN AHMED ON DIRECT RELATIONSHIP OF US MILITARY AID TO PAKISTAN S REMAINING IN CENTO.  DECISIVE FACTOR IN BHUTTO S MIND IS HIS APPRECIATION FOR NIXON ADMINISTRATION S FRIENDLY POSTURE TOWARDS PAKISTAN AND HIS DESIRE AVOID ANY ACTION THAT COULD SERIOUSLY JEOPARDIZE HIS GOVERNMENT S RELATIONS WITH THAT ADMINISTRATION.  BENEATH THIS,  THERE IS APPARENTLY SINCERE FEELING IN BHUTTO S MIND THAT ALLIANCE RELATIONSHIP CALLS FOR A MORE OPEN US MILITARY SUPPLY POLICY TOWARD PAKISTAN ,  ESPECIALLY WHEN IT SEES NEARBY COUNTRIES ( IN GULF REGION)  RECEIVING AMERICAN EQUIPMENT.  BHUTTO CAN BE EXPECTED TO UNDERSTAND USG INHIBITIONS ON MILITARY SUPPLY STEMMING FROM BROADER INTERESTS IN SUBCONTINENT;  BUT THAT DOES NOT MEAN THAT HE ACCEPTS THESE INHIBITIONS AS COMPLETELY JUSTIFIABLE.

REMARK THAT I WOULD REPORT                            CONVERSATION PROMPTLY TAKING SPECIAL NOTE OF CLARIFICATION BHUTTO HAD GIVEN WITH REGARD AZIZAHMED S EARLIER STATEMENTS TO ME7 COMMENT: IN REFTEL I

PAKISTAN S REMAINING IN                                CENTO DECISIVE FACTOR IN                                BHUTTO S MIND IS HIS                            APPRECIATION FOR NIXON                            ADMINISTRATION S FRIENDLY POSTURE TOWARDS PAKISTAN AND HIS DESIRE AVOID                            ANY ACTION THAT COULD SERIOUSLY JEOPARDIZE HIS GOVERNMENT S RELATIONS                            WITH THAT ADMINISTRATION BENEATH THIS THERE IS APPARENTLY SINCERE                            FEELING IN BHUTTO S MIND THAT                            ALLIANCE RELATIONSHIP CALLS FOR A MORE OPEN US MILITARY SUPPLY POLICY                            TOWARD PAKISTAN ESPECIALLY WHEN IT SEES NEARBY COUNTRIES IN GULF                            REGION RECEIVING AMERICAN EQUIPMENT BHUTTO CAN BE EXPECTED TO UNDERSTAND USG INHIBITIONS ON MILITARY SUPPLY STEMMING                            FROM BROADER INTERESTS IN SUBCONTINENT BUT THAT DOES NOT MEAN THAT HE                            ACCEPTS THESE INHIBITIONS AS COMPLETELY JUSTIFIABLE THE ISSUE WILL COME                            UP SHORTLY IN WASHINGTON AND WE SHOULD BE PREPARED FOR FRANK DISCUSSION                            ON ITSOBERSECRET,frus1969-76ve08d60,"1. DURING MEETING JULY 2 WITH AZIZ AHMED, GOP MINISTER OF STATE FOR DEFENSE AND FOREIGN AFFAIRS, CHARGE ASKED HOW AHMED VIEWED OUTCOME OF RECENT CENTO MINISTERIAL COUNCIL MEETING WHICH HE HAD ATTENDED IN TEHRAN. FROM    SECRET\n1. HE RECALLED THAT HE HAD MADE IT CLEAR AT TEHRAN THAT GOP WAS THOROUGHLY DISENCHANTED WITH CENTOS PAST ROLE.\n2. AHMED RECALLED THAT PEOPLES PARTY OF PRES BHUTTO HAD BEEN COMMITTED BY ITS MANIFESTO TO LEAVE CENTO. PARTY WAS UNDER ATTACK NOT ONLY FROM SOME ELEMENTS OF OPPOSITION (NOTABLY WALI KHAN OF NAP) BUT EVEN SOME MEMBERS OF PEOPLES PARTY ITSELF FOR HAVING REMAINED IN CENTO. AS FOR BHUTTO, HE HAD INDICATED THAT HE WAS PREPARED TO KEEP PAKISTAN IN CENTO IF IT COULD BE SHOWN TO BE USEFUL TO PAKISTAN. SECTRETARY ROGERS HAD EVINCED SOME CONCERN, AHMED VOLUNTEERED, WHEN AHMED HAD MADE SIMILAR POINT AT TEHRAN. SECRETARY HAD SAID HE HOPED THIS MATTER WOULD BE DISCUSSED DURING BHUTTOS FORTH- COMING VISIT TO WASHINGTON. THE ""ACID TEST"", ACCORD- ING TO AMED, IS WHETHER USG IS GOING OR NOT GOING TO GIVE PAKISTAN MILITARY AID. ANSWER THUS FAR HAS BEEN ""NO."" IF THAT REMAINS ANSWER, THEN PAKISTAN WILL PROBABLY NOT STAY IN CENTO. IT WOULD BE CLEAR THAT PAKISTAN WILL HAVE TO FEND FOR ITSELF. PAKISTAN HAS TO FACE FACT THAT SOVIETS WILL ACT IN THEIR OWN INTEREST AND THIS HAS IMPLICATIONS FOR PAKISTAN.\n3. CHARGE SAID HE HAD BEEN STRUCK BY FOLLOWING POINTS ABOUT US VIEW OF CENTO WHICH HAD COME OUT AT RECENT TEHRAN MEETING: (A) WE BELIEVE CENTO HAS BEEN USEFUL AND IT CONTINUES TO SERVE USEFUL PURPOSE; (B) WE BELIEVE CENTO IS NOW MORE IMPORTANT FOR POLITICAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL REASONS TO PAKISTAN THAN IT HAS EVER    SECRET\n4. ON POINT JUST MADE BY AHMED, CHARGE SAID IT WAS NOT IMMEDIATELY CLEAR TO HIM HOW WITHDRAWAL FROM CENTO WOULD HELP PAKISTAN DEFEND ITSELF AGAINST SOVIETS. AHMED REPLIED THAT PAK MEMBERSHIP IN CENTO IS A DETERRENT TO GOOD RELATIONS WITH USSR. BUT HE DID NOT BELIEVE THAT THREAT TO PAKISTAN CAME DIRECTLY FROM MILITARY ACTION BY SOVIETS AS MUCH AS IT DID THROUGH SOVIET COLLABORATION WITH INDIA. HE DID NOT BELIEVE GROWING US-SOVIET DETENTE WOULD ACTUALLY DETER USSR FROM MOVING TO DAMAGE PAKISTAN IF IT FELT THAT WAS IN ITS INTEREST. GOP WELCOMED US-SOV DETENTE GENERALLY BUT FEARED IT DID NOT OFFER EFFECTIVE BRAKE ON SOVIET COOPERATION WITH INDIA. AHMED CLAIMED THAT SOVIET MILITARY AID TO INDIA WAS INTENDED AGAINST PAKISTAN. IN HIS VIEW, SOVS GIVE PRIMARY IMPORTANCE TO PERSIAN GULF AND TYEY CONSIDER PAKISTAN AS PART OF GULF AREA. IN ADDITION, SOVS RESENT PAKISTANS FRIENDSHIP WITH CHINA AND US.\n5. CHARGE SAID THAT IN PROMITING DETENTE WITH USSR, USG IS NOT MAKING DEALS AT EXPENSE OF THIRD COUNTRIES. WE BELIEVE THAT, TO DETREE THAT GENERAL ATMOSPHERE OF DETENTE IMPROVES PROSPECTS FOR STABILITY IN SUB- CONTINENT, THIS IS ALL TO GOOD. AT SAME TIME, WE DO NOT BELIEVE SOVIETS SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO ASSUME DOMINANT POSITION IN AREA AND WE WILL REMAIN VIGILANT. AHMED REMARKED THAT GOP COULD EASILY BELIEVE IN SUCH COMMENTS WHEN THEY EMANATE FROM USG. BUT IT DOES NOT BELIEVE IN GOOD INTENTIONS OF SOVIETS. HE THOUGHT DETENTE WITH US WOULD HELP USSR TO DISENGAGE FROM CERTAIN PROBLEMS WITH RESULT THAT IT COULD TURN ATTENTION MORE    SECRET\n6. AHMED SAID HE ANTICIPATED FURTHER DISCUSSION THIS SUBJECT DURING BHUTTOS VISIT TO US.\n7. COMMENT: AHMEDS HARD-LINE VIEWS ON SOVIET INTENTIONS (AND ON SOVIET-INDIAN COLLABORATION) ARE WELL KNOWN TO US. HE EXPRESSED NO NEW POSITIONS IN THIS CONVERSATION ALTHOUGH IT MAY BE SIGNIFICANT THAT HE CHOSE TO POINT OUT HIS VIEWS UNCHANGED DESPITE US-USSR EFFORT TO REDUCE TENSIONS. WE ARE INCLINED BELIEVE THAT PRES BHUTTO DOES NOT SHARE AHMEDS CONCERNS FULLY,AT LEAST WITH SIMILAR STARKNESS AND INTENSITY. WE ARE UNCERTAIN THAT BHUTTO WILL WISH MAKE EXTENSION OF US MILITARY AID THE CONDITION FOR PAK CONTINUANCE IN CENTO. SOBER\n",841349

END SUMMARY UNCLASSIFIED 1.  VISIT TO THE US:  IN PREPARED STATEMENT, PRESIDENT SAID HE PLANNED EXCHANGE VIEWS WITH PRESIDENT NIXON ON ISSUES OF BILATERAL INTEREST AND REGIONAL PEACE AND SECURITY UNDER CONDITIONS ENSURING SOVEREIGN EQUALITY OF ALL STATES OF REGION AND SAFEGUARDING THEM AGAINST THREAT OF DOMINATION AND HEGEMONY.  ASKED IF RESUMP- TION OF US ARM SUPPLIES TO PAKISTAN WOULD BE DISCUSSED, PRESIDENT REPORTEDLY REPLIED ""WE WILL DISCUSS EVERY- THING AFFECTING PAKISTAN-US RELATIONS.  I DONT WANT TO SAY ANYTHING MORE AT THIS STAGE.""  BHUTTO DENIED THAT JULY 10 NATIONAL ASSEMBLY BANGLADESH RECOGNI- TION RESOLUTION (ISLAMABAD 5550) HAD ANY BEARING ON HIS VISIT TO THE US AND DESCRIBED IT RATHER AS MEANINGFUL COUNTER-INITIATIVE TO THE INDIAN-BANGLA- DESH PROPOSALS OF APRIL 17.  ACCORDING TO BHUTTO, VISIT TO US WILL PROMOTE ONE OF THE ESSENTIAL COMPONENTS OF PAKISTANS FOREIGN POLICY OF BILATERALISM, I.E. FRIENDLY RELATIONS WITH ALL THREE MAJOR POWERS IN SPLITE OF ANY DIFFERENCES THAT MAY EXIST AMONG THEM. DESCRIBING PAKISTANS RELATIONSHIPS WITH THE US AS WARM AND FRIENDLY, PRESIDENT EXPRESSED BELIEF FORTH- COMING TALKS WILL SERVE TO STRENGTHEN AND CONSOLIDATE US-PAKISTAN RELATIONSHIPS.\n2.  TALKS WITH INDIA AND BANGLADESH RECOGNITION: PRESIDENT SAID PAKISTAN HAD AGREED TO HOLD OFFICIAL- LEVEL TALKS WITH INDIA JULY 24, AND THAT VENUE WOULD BE IN PAKISTAN.

HASKARS STATE- MENT THAT INDO-PAKISTAN TALKS WOULD BE HELD ON BASIS OF APRIL 17 INDO-BANGLADESH OFFER, BHUTTO SAID HAKSAR WAS ENTITLED TO HIS VIEWS, BUT PAKISTAN COULD NOT ACCEPT A PRINCIPLE (THREE WAY EXCHANGE OF POWS, BENGALEES AND BIHARIS) WHICH IT DID NOT UNDERSTAND THOROUGHLY, AND HAD ITS OWN VIEWPOINT ON THIS ISSUE. GOP WOULD BE PREPARED TO DISCUSS WITH INDIAN REPRESENTATIVES ANY MATTER WHICH GOI WANTED TO RAISE IN THE DISCUSSIONS.  DESCRIBING INDIAN-BANGLA- DESH APRIL 17TH OFFER AS ONE WHICH DID NOT TURN OUT UNCLASSIFIED TO BE AS BIG AS IT APPEARED, BHUTTO DESCRIBED JULY 10 NATIONAL ASSEMBLY RESOLUTION SANCTIONING RECOGNITION OF BANGLADESH WHEN IN THE SUPREME NATIONAL INTEREST AS A MORE SOLID AND GENUINE COUNTER-INITIATIVE TO UNFREEZE THE STALEMATE.  BHUTTO SAID THAT NATIONAL ASSEMBLY BD RESOLUTION WAS CONCRETE DEMONSTRA- TION OF PAKISTANS SINCERITY IN ITS QUEST FOR A JUST PEACE, AND ITS FEARLESS FACING OF OBJECTIVE REALITIES. NONETHELESS, INITIAL PREREQUISITES TO NORMALIZA- TION OF SITUATION IN SUBCONTINENT WERE RELEASE AND REPATRIATION OF ALL PAKISTAN POWS AND ABANDONEMENT OF THE IDEA OF WAR CRIME TRIALS.  ANNOUNCED GOP DECISION TO AUTHORIZE PRIORITY REPATRIATION 5,000 BENGALEES UNDER AEGIS UNHCR WITHOUT INSISTING ON PRIOR ASSURANCE BD RECIPROCITY.  (DETAILS BEING REPORTED BY EMBASSY ISLAMABAD IN SEPTEL)\n3.

IN PREPARED STATEMENT BHUTTO CRITICIZED OPPOSITION PARTIES FOR THEIR WALKING OUT AT JULY 9 NATIONAL ASSEMBLY SESSION AS INDICATING OPPOSITION HAD NOTHING TO SAY WHICH WOULD HAVE STOOD THE TEST OF REASON.  BHUTTO WARNED OPPOSITION THAT IF THEY TRIED TO START TROUBLE WHILE HE ABSENT ABROAD, GOVERNMENT WAS FULLY PREPARED TO MEET ANY SITUATION.  BHUTTO CONGRATULATED PAKISTAN PEOPLES PARTY ON ITS SUCCESSES IN RECENT SENATE ELECTIONS (ISLAMABAD 5576) AND ASSURED PEOPLE GOVERNMENT WILL DO ALL IT CAN TO ALLEVIATE SUFFERING CAUSED BY RECENT HEAVY RAINS AND CONSEQUENT FLOODING IN SEVERAL AREAS OF PAKISTAN.

                        ANNOUNCEMENT OF CHANGE IN OUR MILITARY SUPPLY POLICY LESS THAN FOUR                            MONTHS AGO BHUTTO HIMSELF HAD                            EXPRESSED APPRECIATION

PAKISTAN S REMAINING IN                                CENTO DECISIVE FACTOR IN                                BHUTTO S MIND IS HIS                            APPRECIATION FOR NIXON                            ADMINISTRATION S FRIENDLY POSTURE TOWARDS PAKISTAN AND HIS DESIRE AVOID                            ANY ACTION THAT COULD SERIOUSLY JEOPARDIZE HIS GOVERNMENT S RELATIONS                            WITH THAT ADMINISTRATION BENEATH THIS THERE IS APPARENTLY SINCERE                            FEELING IN BHUTTO S MIND THAT                            ALLIANCE RELATIONSHIP CALLS FOR A MORE OPEN US MILITARY SUPPLY POLICY                            TOWARD PAKISTAN ESPECIALLY WHEN IT SEES NEARBY COUNTRIES IN GULF                            REGION RECEIVING AMERICAN EQUIPMENT BHUTTO CAN BE EXPECTED TO UNDERSTAND USG INHIBITIONS ON MILITARY SUPPLY STEMMING                            FROM BROADER INTERESTS IN SUBCONTINENT BUT THAT DOES NOT MEAN THAT HE                            ACCEPTS THESE INHIBITIONS AS COMPLETELY JUSTIFIABLE THE ISSUE WILL COME                            UP SHORTLY IN WASHINGTON AND WE SHOULD BE PREPARED FOR FRANK DISCUSSION                            ON

BHUTTO MET JULY 25 FOR AN HOUR AND 20 MINUTES WITH POMPIDOU DURING WHICH THEY DISCUSSED THE WORLD SITUATION WITH PARTICULAR REFERENCE TO ASIA AND THE INDIAN SUBCONTINENT. THEN, JOINED BY THEIR MINISTERS, THEY DISCUSSED BILATERAL QUESTIONS INCLUDING THE REINFORCING OF THEIR RELATIONS.  ON JULY 26, BHUTTO GAVE A PRESS CONFERENCE IN WHICH HE SAID HIS VIEWS AND THOSE OF POMPIDOU WERE VERY CLOSE ON MANY POLITICAL PROBLEMS AND ON THE ANALYSIS OF THE WORLD SITUATION.\n2.  IN RESPONSE TO QUESTIONS, BHUTTO SAID HE HOPED RELA- TIONS WITH AFGHNISTAN WOULD REMAIN GOOD, BUT IF THEY SHOULD DETERIORATE, PAKISTAN WOULD BE QUITE CAPABLE OF DEFENDING ITS NATIONAL INTERESTS.  BHUTTO SAID PAKISTAN COULD ACCEPT THE ""SO-CALLED REALITY"" OF BANGLADESH, BUT COULD NOT ABANDON THE PRINCIPLE OF SELF- DETERMINATION FOR JAMMU AND KASHMIR.  BHUTTO SAID THAT HE HAD RAISED IN LONDON AND PARIS THE RELEASE OF UNCLASSIFIED PAKISTAN PRISONERS HELD BY INDIA AND HIS VIEWS WERE WELL RECEIVED BY POMPIDOU AND THE BRITISH LEADERS.\n3.
