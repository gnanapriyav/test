very cordial Secretary stressed USG attaches great importance to process of negotiation and                        sees no substitute for negotiations in finding solution to Middle East                        problem Secretary indicated our concern in this regard is mainly with                        Egypt since Jordan has made clear its readiness to talk Secretary pointed                        out USG wants to be helpful but contrary                        to belief of some we cannot impose a solution We think that if agreement                        could be reached between Egypt and Israel on opening of Suez Canal it would                        generate momentum for settlement between Jordan and Israel Secretary                        assured King Hussein we have                        JordanianIsraeli side of problem very much in mind King raised Jordanian                        assistance requests with Secretary in brief private meeting following                        luncheon and Secretary said we would do all we can to help Jordan within                        limit of our resources which he noted are currently under great                        pressure2 King Hussein was accompanied at                        meeting by Royal Court Minister Amer                            Khammash Foreign Minister Salah                            Abu Zaid Political Adviser Zaid                            Rifai Minister of Finance Farid                            alSadad General Ben Shaker and Jordanian Ambassador to                            USMufti On US side Deputy Secretary                            Rush AID Administrator Hannah Under Secretary Tarr Asst Secy Sisco Ambassador Brown and ARN Country Director Korn were present Luncheon and meeting afterwards were very                        cordial and warm and lasted just over two hours3 Secretary opened by remarking that we have come to agreement in VietNam                        and have created conditions in which there can be peace if the parties want                        it Secretary pointed out that in every area of world except the Middle East                        we have been able to get parties to talk in Germany in Korea and in                        VietNam It is difficult to see how any progress can be made toward a                        Middle East solution unless Arabs and Israelis are ready to do the same as                        other parties to major world conflicts Secretary said he wanted to make                        clear that his remarks about need for negotiations were not addressed to                        Jordanians for we know that Jordan is ready to talk But he wanted to                        stress that the Middle East conflict is far too complex to solve without an                        active exchange of ideas between the parties Rifai referred to his                        recent visit to Cairo and his conversation with President Sadat and said that Sadat is ready to negotiate but needs a                        prior commitment from Israelis regarding the line of withdrawal Rifai said                        President Sadat is neither willing                        nor able to discuss concessions with Israelis He cannot give up sovereignty                        over any part of Sinai4 Secretary replied that it just does not make any sense to ask other side                        for commitments as precondition for entering into negotiations Suppose we                        had done that in our negotiations with Russians We would never have reached                        agreement with them on Berlin or on SALT                        Deputy Secretary Rush pointed out                        that it took 18 months and difficult discussions to reach agreement on                        Berlin and that no progress would ever have been made had we not been                        prepared to participate in give and take of negotiations Foreign Minister                            Abu Zaid interjected that it is                        Israelis not Arabs who put conditions on negotiations Israelis say they                        are ready to conduct negotiations provided that Jerusalem Sharm alSheikh                        and Golan Heights will not be subject to negotiation5 King Hussein said his feeling is                        that so many agreements have now taken place throughout the world that                        Middle East is only remaining problem It is imperative now that world turn                        its attention to Middle East and that progress be made King Hussein stressed importance of action now                        Secretary pointed out that in every negotiation each side has its own                        position and there is nothing unusual in one or both sides stating those                        positions What is unusual is for one side to say to other that it must give                        in before there can even be talks Secretary noted that Israel states that                        its principal concern is security Egypt on other hand tells Israel that it                        does not need to worry about security once an agreement has been signed                        Secretary said he saw no reason why Israeli and Egyptian positions need be                        irreconcilable However problems are so complex that it is impossible to                        decide them at any one time If some progress can be made toward a Suez                        agreement Secretary said then momentum will be developed toward solution                        of other aspects of problem6 Rifai took issue with Secretary on                        foregoing and said Egypt would find itself weaker and further from achieving                        a lasting settlement if Suez agreement is concluded Secretary said he                        disagreed absolutely If an agreement is reached on Suez this will very                        definitely create a new impetus for negotiations Additionally since                        Egyptians would cross to East Bank of canal in framework of a Suez                        agreement he could not see how anyone could say that Egypt would be weaker                        militarily Rifai objected that Egyptian military forces would not cross                        canal Secretary pointed out that even so there would still be Egyptians on                        East Bank of canal for first time since 1967 and Israelis would with draw from the Bar Lev LineThe BarLev Line named for Israeli Chief of Staff                            Haim BarLev was a chain of fortifications that Israel built along the                            eastern coast of the Suez Canal after it captured the Sinai Peninsula                            from Egypt during the 1967 war In these circumstances how could                        anyone say that Egypt would be weaker Egypt would be much better off                        because world would want to keep canal open and would put pressure on Israel                        to move forward to a full settlement and not do anything which would place                        canal in danger Moreover Secretary pointed out there would be some kind                        of force separating two sides and Egypt would receive a commitment from                        Israel to continue negotiations for a full settlement Secretary said he was                        sure Egypt could make a good settlement with Israel through negotiations a                        much better one than could be achieved by any other means Rifai said that in event of an                        IsraeliEgyptian settlement on canal Jordans position would be much                        weaker Secretary said he did not agree Rifai replied main problem is not the canal but Jerusalem                        and West Bank7 King Hussein said Sadat has begun recently to think of war                        as a serious alternative even though following Russian withdrawal he may                        now be less capable of undertaking it Problem is that Sadat feels himself unable to make                        concessions to Israel which would be needed for a negotiated settlement but                        feels under pressure to do something Sadat seems to think that war if started can be kept under                        control and would not get too far out of hand Hussein said what he did not understand is how Sadat expects Israel will play the game of                        war with him in accordance with his own rules8 The Secretary said what is at issue basically in discussions between Egypt                        and Israel on a Suez agreement is the difference between further                        withdrawal and total withdrawal Israel is ready to give a commitment for                        further withdrawal but not for total withdrawal Secretary wondered if                        it might not be best to leave this issue ambiguous as was done in Resolution                        242 and on some issues in the Vietnam agreement The Secretary noted that                        Vietnam agreement would never have been reached had parties insisted on                        defining everything precisely in order to reach agreement certain things                        have to be left ambiguous Rifai                        objected that if there is going to be peace in the Middle East there must be                        total Israeli withdrawal The question is whether Israel is going to                        withdraw totally or not Rifai                        insisted it is not possible for Sadat or any other Arab leader to concede territory to                        Israel The Secretary replied that what Rifai had said is not borne out                        anywhere in history There has never been a war that was not followed by                        territorial changes Moreover wars have always been followed by long                        periods in which the situation was unclear This the Secretary noted was                        true even of Second World War where Allied victory was completely clearcut Rifai said that what Secretary was in effect saying was that                        he agreed with Egyptians when they say that what was taken by force must be                        regained by force No not at all Secretary replied Secretary pointed out                        that there has almost never in history been a situation in which territory                        lost in a war was regained by force soon thereafter9 King Hussein said he feels main                        problem is really JordanianIsraeli side of question Whether a possible                        agreement between Egypt and Israel will help he did not know though he had                        no objection to an effort being made for such an agreement King Hussein said he felt Jerusalem was intended                        to be a city of peace not one of war and he did not see any reason it                        should not be possible to work out some sort of solution in regard to                        Jerusalem On broader matter of negotiations King Hussein pointed out that in all other major                        areas where agreement had been reached in Germany Vietnam and other                        places the matter of reaching a settlement had not been left entirely to                        the parties concerned The rest of the world had helped the parties to reach                        an understanding and in many cases the worlds help had been significant if                        not crucial King Hussein said he                        felt the same must apply to the Middle East The parties ability to help                        themselves in the Middle East conflict is limited and the world must give                        them as much support as possible10 Secretary said he agreed entirely with King Hussein and had two comments: First is that US attaches tremendous importance to the                        process of negotiations Mr Rifai                        had pointed out that positions of two sides are intractable but in our view                        that is precisely why there must be negotiations Second point Secretary                        said is that one of the difficulties is that there is a feeling that USG can solve the Middle East problems if it                        wants to Secretary emphasized that this is not true USG can be helpful in framework of negotiating                        process but idea that USG can impose a                        solution is false Secretary pointed out that USG has greatest interest in Jordan and feels strongest                        friendship and support for King Hussein But despite this and all importance we attach to a                        settlement we are unable to impose one on the parties Secretary stressed                        that he did not want to be critical of President Sadat but we do think Sadat is making a mistake in refusing to                        negotiate We feel Sadat had done                        many good things and we want him to be successful We believe if                        negotiations could get started between Egypt and Israel Egypt could get a                        much better solution than it could hope for by any other means King                            Hussein said that in any event he                        thought Jordans case was very strong Secretary noted that when we talk to                        His Majesty about the need for negotiations we are talking to the converted                        since King Hussein has been very                        openminded on this subject Under Secretary Tarr noted that settlement which was accepted by North and                        South Vietnamese would have been viewed by both sides as completely                        unacceptable at outset of negotiations11 King Hussein said he believes                        Jordan must do utmost to achieve a solution but whatever solution is reached                        must be one which will be accepted by people and one which can be beginning                        of real progress and stability Secretary and Deputy Secretary congratulated                        King on his statesmanship and remarked that his example is one which should                        be followed by Egyptians Assistant Secretary Sisco asked if King were to find some glimmer of flexibility                        in the Israeli position how would he feel about the question of which side                        there should be a settlement with first Egypt or Jordan Sisco said we have always thought a Suez                        agreement might be helpful to His Majesty in reaching an agreement with                        Israel King Hussein replied that if                        there were a glimmer of hope he would do everything possible to reach an                        agreement with Israel King said it of no importance to him whether Jordan                        is first second or third to sign agreement with Israel as long as                        settlement is acceptable If a Suez agreement would help in creating a good                        atmosphere that would be fine the King said but Jordan thinks Jerusalem                        and West Bank are the main issues Secretary asked if it would be helpful if                        discussions were to start at same time between Jordan and Israel and Egypt                        and Israel The King responded affirmatively FonMinAbu Zaid said it is important                        however that in any such negotiations the parties not be left alone                        Someone should be there to help them reach agreement12 King Hussein asked Secretarys                        evaluation of Soviet intentions with regard to Middle East conflict                        Secretary said we do not think Soviets are trying to stimulate a renewal of                        hostilities Soviets were very embarrassed by their expulsion from Egypt and                        are now trying to recover the lost ground in Syria and Iraq We do not think                        the Soviets will try to promote negotiations at the outset at least but if                        negotiations get started they might change their attitude We believe                        Soviets welcome continuation of ceasefire King Hussein asked whether opening of Suez Canal would not be to                        advantage of USSR Secretary said there                        would be some advantage to Soviets but we feel that advantages to US would be even greater USG has many and broad interests in Middle                        East and we have every reason to want a settlement Only problem we have in                        our relations with Arabs is Israel Otherwise we get along fine with Arabs                        Secretary said much better than Soviets do13 Secretary remarked that Soviets are competing with China in Middle East                        and for this reason they may feel they have to continue to support Arab                        positions Secretary said he thought Soviets might be pleased to have a                        settlement but for reason he had just cited might find it difficult to be                        active in promoting one King Hussein                        said he thought Soviets would want a degree of trouble and chaos in Middle                        East because they profit from it King noted Soviets are putting a lot of                        equipment into Iraq and have delivered large amounts of military hardware                            to Syria They would like to have                        Syria and Iraq together under USSRs                        aegis14 Finance Minister Saad said that with His Majestys permission he wanted                        to say a word about Israeli actions in Jerusalem and on West Bank Finance                        Minister noted he had been Governor of Palestine in Mandate times and he                        knew Israelis well and had learned their language He could understand how                        there could be negotiations between two equal partners but felt that present                        situation was different Israelis are laying claim to all parts of West Bank                        and are setting up settlements everywhere Finance Minister said he would                        like to ask how Israeli withdrawal can be visualized when Israelis have put                        up so many settlements Secretary said problem is difficult one there is no                        doubt about that But the longer the delay in beginning negotiations the                        more difficult it will become Nothing is gained by delaying It may be that                        Egypt and Israel cannot work out an agreement but even if that is case it                        will not hurt to try Should an agreement be reached Secretary said he was                        sure it would help prospects for an agreement between Jordan and Israel                        Secretary pointed out that USG does not                        support Israels action in establishing settlements on West Bank and has                        said so publicly This USG position has not                        stopped Israelis but it may have slowed them down15 Asst Secy Sisco said one of                        reasons USG emphasizes Suez agreement is                        that if such agreement were to be reached it would create added incentive on                        Israel to face up to compromises needed to reach agreement with Jordan                            Sisco said that it is this                        Jordanian side of problem which we have in mind when we say we do not see                        Suez agreement as an end in itself Secretary said this is absolutely right                        If there is agreement between Israel and Egypt USG would be in much better position to be helpful on other                        issues16 At this point

million in total aid in 1973 He also suggested that it might be a good                            idea to promise the King an additional 15 million in budget support                            before

very impressed with work and planning that went into it17 Secretary remarked USG is very impressed                        at actions His Majestys Government had taken to eliminate fedayeen threat                        We feel this was very important Nothing has contributed more to stability                        in Jordan Secretary said we have told this to Lebanese have urged them to                        act against fedayeen also and it appears that they are doing so Secretary                        reiterated that USG wants to do everything                        it can to assist Jordan Hussein said                        that Jordan had no choice but to take the action it did against fedayeen He                        stressed that Jordan has no intention of readmitting fedayeen to its                        territory: We will never reopen our country to them Sisco asked how tight a rein Syrians are                        keeping on fedayeen King Hussein                        said Syrians are tightening up and have removed fedayeen from front line                        King stressed that in recent Cairo Defense Council Jordan did not accept                        return of fedayeen and did not agree to put its army under any other                            commandThe Arab Defense Council met in                            Cairo in JanuarySisco asked if there were a                        possibility for resumption of diplomatic relations with Egypt and Syria                        King Hussein replied he thought so                        Foreign Minister Abu Zaid responded                        that on basis of his contacts at Cairo meeting and elsewhere he thought                        prospects are reasonably good18 In closing Secretary reiterated USGs

1,0.1874441329261094,25110 Subject: Secretarys Meeting With King Hussein1 Summary Secretary met with King Hussein for working lunch and talk at Department February 6                        Meeting was very cordial Secretary stressed USG attaches great importance to process of negotiation and                        sees no substitute for negotiations in finding solution to Middle East                        problem Secretary indicated our concern in this regard is mainly with                        Egypt since Jordan has made clear its readiness to talk Secretary pointed                        out USG wants to be helpful but contrary                        to belief of some we cannot impose a solution We think that if agreement                        could be reached between Egypt and Israel on opening of Suez Canal it would                        generate momentum for settlement between Jordan and Israel Secretary                        assured King Hussein we have                        JordanianIsraeli side of problem very much in mind King raised Jordanian                        assistance requests with Secretary in brief private meeting following                        luncheon and Secretary said we would do all we can to help Jordan within                        limit of our resources which he noted are currently under great                        pressure2 King Hussein was accompanied at                        meeting by Royal Court Minister Amer                            Khammash Foreign Minister Salah                            Abu Zaid Political Adviser Zaid                            Rifai Minister of Finance Farid                            alSadad General Ben Shaker and Jordanian Ambassador to                            USMufti On US side Deputy Secretary                            Rush AID Administrator Hannah Under Secretary Tarr Asst Secy Sisco Ambassador Brown and ARN Country Director Korn were present Luncheon and meeting afterwards were very                        cordial and warm and lasted just over two hours3 Secretary opened by remarking that we have come to agreement in VietNam                        and have created conditions in which there can be peace if the parties want                        it Secretary pointed out that in every area of world except the Middle East                        we have been able to get parties to talk in Germany in Korea and in                        VietNam It is difficult to see how any progress can be made toward a                        Middle East solution unless Arabs and Israelis are ready to do the same as                        other parties to major world conflicts Secretary said he wanted to make                        clear that his remarks about need for negotiations were not addressed to                        Jordanians for we know that Jordan is ready to talk But he wanted to                        stress that the Middle East conflict is far too complex to solve without an                        active exchange of ideas between the parties Rifai referred to his                        recent visit to Cairo and his conversation with President Sadat and said that Sadat is ready to negotiate but needs a                        prior commitment from Israelis regarding the line of withdrawal Rifai said                        President Sadat is neither willing                        nor able to discuss concessions with Israelis He cannot give up sovereignty                        over any part of Sinai4 Secretary replied that it just does not make any sense to ask other side                        for commitments as precondition for entering into negotiations Suppose we                        had done that in our negotiations with Russians We would never have reached                        agreement with them on Berlin or on SALT                        Deputy Secretary Rush pointed out                        that it took 18 months and difficult discussions to reach agreement on                        Berlin and that no progress would ever have been made had we not been                        prepared to participate in give and take of negotiations Foreign Minister                            Abu Zaid interjected that it is                        Israelis not Arabs who put conditions on negotiations Israelis say they                        are ready to conduct negotiations provided that Jerusalem Sharm alSheikh                        and Golan Heights will not be subject to negotiation5 King Hussein said his feeling is                        that so many agreements have now taken place throughout the world that                        Middle East is only remaining problem It is imperative now that world turn                        its attention to Middle East and that progress be made King Hussein stressed importance of action now                        Secretary pointed out that in every negotiation each side has its own                        position and there is nothing unusual in one or both sides stating those                        positions What is unusual is for one side to say to other that it must give                        in before there can even be talks Secretary noted that Israel states that                        its principal concern is security Egypt on other hand tells Israel that it                        does not need to worry about security once an agreement has been signed                        Secretary said he saw no reason why Israeli and Egyptian positions need be                        irreconcilable However problems are so complex that it is impossible to                        decide them at any one time If some progress can be made toward a Suez                        agreement Secretary said then momentum will be developed toward solution                        of other aspects of problem6 Rifai took issue with Secretary on                        foregoing and said Egypt would find itself weaker and further from achieving                        a lasting settlement if Suez agreement is concluded Secretary said he                        disagreed absolutely If an agreement is reached on Suez this will very                        definitely create a new impetus for negotiations Additionally since                        Egyptians would cross to East Bank of canal in framework of a Suez                        agreement he could not see how anyone could say that Egypt would be weaker                        militarily Rifai objected that Egyptian military forces would not cross                        canal Secretary pointed out that even so there would still be Egyptians on                        East Bank of canal for first time since 1967 and Israelis would with draw from the Bar Lev LineThe BarLev Line named for Israeli Chief of Staff                            Haim BarLev was a chain of fortifications that Israel built along the                            eastern coast of the Suez Canal after it captured the Sinai Peninsula                            from Egypt during the 1967 war In these circumstances how could                        anyone say that Egypt would be weaker Egypt would be much better off                        because world would want to keep canal open and would put pressure on Israel                        to move forward to a full settlement and not do anything which would place                        canal in danger Moreover Secretary pointed out there would be some kind                        of force separating two sides and Egypt would receive a commitment from                        Israel to continue negotiations for a full settlement Secretary said he was                        sure Egypt could make a good settlement with Israel through negotiations a                        much better one than could be achieved by any other means Rifai said that in event of an                        IsraeliEgyptian settlement on canal Jordans position would be much                        weaker Secretary said he did not agree Rifai replied main problem is not the canal but Jerusalem                        and West Bank7 King Hussein said Sadat has begun recently to think of war                        as a serious alternative even though following Russian withdrawal he may                        now be less capable of undertaking it Problem is that Sadat feels himself unable to make                        concessions to Israel which would be needed for a negotiated settlement but                        feels under pressure to do something Sadat seems to think that war if started can be kept under                        control and would not get too far out of hand Hussein said what he did not understand is how Sadat expects Israel will play the game of                        war with him in accordance with his own rules8 The Secretary said what is at issue basically in discussions between Egypt                        and Israel on a Suez agreement is the difference between further                        withdrawal and total withdrawal Israel is ready to give a commitment for                        further withdrawal but not for total withdrawal Secretary wondered if                        it might not be best to leave this issue ambiguous as was done in Resolution                        242 and on some issues in the Vietnam agreement The Secretary noted that                        Vietnam agreement would never have been reached had parties insisted on                        defining everything precisely in order to reach agreement certain things                        have to be left ambiguous Rifai                        objected that if there is going to be peace in the Middle East there must be                        total Israeli withdrawal The question is whether Israel is going to                        withdraw totally or not Rifai                        insisted it is not possible for Sadat or any other Arab leader to concede territory to                        Israel The Secretary replied that what Rifai had said is not borne out                        anywhere in history There has never been a war that was not followed by                        territorial changes Moreover wars have always been followed by long                        periods in which the situation was unclear This the Secretary noted was                        true even of Second World War where Allied victory was completely clearcut Rifai said that what Secretary was in effect saying was that                        he agreed with Egyptians when they say that what was taken by force must be                        regained by force No not at all Secretary replied Secretary pointed out                        that there has almost never in history been a situation in which territory                        lost in a war was regained by force soon thereafter9 King Hussein said he feels main                        problem is really JordanianIsraeli side of question Whether a possible                        agreement between Egypt and Israel will help he did not know though he had                        no objection to an effort being made for such an agreement King Hussein said he felt Jerusalem was intended                        to be a city of peace not one of war and he did not see any reason it                        should not be possible to work out some sort of solution in regard to                        Jerusalem On broader matter of negotiations King Hussein pointed out that in all other major                        areas where agreement had been reached in Germany Vietnam and other                        places the matter of reaching a settlement had not been left entirely to                        the parties concerned The rest of the world had helped the parties to reach                        an understanding and in many cases the worlds help had been significant if                        not crucial King Hussein said he                        felt the same must apply to the Middle East The parties ability to help                        themselves in the Middle East conflict is limited and the world must give                        them as much support as possible10 Secretary said he agreed entirely with King Hussein and had two comments: First is that US attaches tremendous importance to the                        process of negotiations Mr Rifai                        had pointed out that positions of two sides are intractable but in our view                        that is precisely why there must be negotiations Second point Secretary                        said is that one of the difficulties is that there is a feeling that USG can solve the Middle East problems if it                        wants to Secretary emphasized that this is not true USG can be helpful in framework of negotiating                        process but idea that USG can impose a                        solution is false Secretary pointed out that USG has greatest interest in Jordan and feels strongest                        friendship and support for King Hussein But despite this and all importance we attach to a                        settlement we are unable to impose one on the parties Secretary stressed                        that he did not want to be critical of President Sadat but we do think Sadat is making a mistake in refusing to                        negotiate We feel Sadat had done                        many good things and we want him to be successful We believe if                        negotiations could get started between Egypt and Israel Egypt could get a                        much better solution than it could hope for by any other means King                            Hussein said that in any event he                        thought Jordans case was very strong Secretary noted that when we talk to                        His Majesty about the need for negotiations we are talking to the converted                        since King Hussein has been very                        openminded on this subject Under Secretary Tarr noted that settlement which was accepted by North and                        South Vietnamese would have been viewed by both sides as completely                        unacceptable at outset of negotiations11 King Hussein said he believes                        Jordan must do utmost to achieve a solution but whatever solution is reached                        must be one which will be accepted by people and one which can be beginning                        of real progress and stability Secretary and Deputy Secretary congratulated                        King on his statesmanship and remarked that his example is one which should                        be followed by Egyptians Assistant Secretary Sisco asked if King were to find some glimmer of flexibility                        in the Israeli position how would he feel about the question of which side                        there should be a settlement with first Egypt or Jordan Sisco said we have always thought a Suez                        agreement might be helpful to His Majesty in reaching an agreement with                        Israel King Hussein replied that if                        there were a glimmer of hope he would do everything possible to reach an                        agreement with Israel King said it of no importance to him whether Jordan                        is first second or third to sign agreement with Israel as long as                        settlement is acceptable If a Suez agreement would help in creating a good                        atmosphere that would be fine the King said but Jordan thinks Jerusalem                        and West Bank are the main issues Secretary asked if it would be helpful if                        discussions were to start at same time between Jordan and Israel and Egypt                        and Israel The King responded affirmatively FonMinAbu Zaid said it is important                        however that in any such negotiations the parties not be left alone                        Someone should be there to help them reach agreement12 King Hussein asked Secretarys                        evaluation of Soviet intentions with regard to Middle East conflict                        Secretary said we do not think Soviets are trying to stimulate a renewal of                        hostilities Soviets were very embarrassed by their expulsion from Egypt and                        are now trying to recover the lost ground in Syria and Iraq We do not think                        the Soviets will try to promote negotiations at the outset at least but if                        negotiations get started they might change their attitude We believe                        Soviets welcome continuation of ceasefire King Hussein asked whether opening of Suez Canal would not be to                        advantage of USSR Secretary said there                        would be some advantage to Soviets but we feel that advantages to US would be even greater USG has many and broad interests in Middle                        East and we have every reason to want a settlement Only problem we have in                        our relations with Arabs is Israel Otherwise we get along fine with Arabs                        Secretary said much better than Soviets do13 Secretary remarked that Soviets are competing with China in Middle East                        and for this reason they may feel they have to continue to support Arab                        positions Secretary said he thought Soviets might be pleased to have a                        settlement but for reason he had just cited might find it difficult to be                        active in promoting one King Hussein                        said he thought Soviets would want a degree of trouble and chaos in Middle                        East because they profit from it King noted Soviets are putting a lot of                        equipment into Iraq and have delivered large amounts of military hardware                            to Syria They would like to have                        Syria and Iraq together under USSRs                        aegis14 Finance Minister Saad said that with His Majestys permission he wanted                        to say a word about Israeli actions in Jerusalem and on West Bank Finance                        Minister noted he had been Governor of Palestine in Mandate times and he                        knew Israelis well and had learned their language He could understand how                        there could be negotiations between two equal partners but felt that present                        situation was different Israelis are laying claim to all parts of West Bank                        and are setting up settlements everywhere Finance Minister said he would                        like to ask how Israeli withdrawal can be visualized when Israelis have put                        up so many settlements Secretary said problem is difficult one there is no                        doubt about that But the longer the delay in beginning negotiations the                        more difficult it will become Nothing is gained by delaying It may be that                        Egypt and Israel cannot work out an agreement but even if that is case it                        will not hurt to try Should an agreement be reached Secretary said he was                        sure it would help prospects for an agreement between Jordan and Israel                        Secretary pointed out that USG does not                        support Israels action in establishing settlements on West Bank and has                        said so publicly This USG position has not                        stopped Israelis but it may have slowed them down15 Asst Secy Sisco said one of                        reasons USG emphasizes Suez agreement is                        that if such agreement were to be reached it would create added incentive on                        Israel to face up to compromises needed to reach agreement with Jordan                            Sisco said that it is this                        Jordanian side of problem which we have in mind when we say we do not see                        Suez agreement as an end in itself Secretary said this is absolutely right                        If there is agreement between Israel and Egypt USG would be in much better position to be helpful on other                        issues16 At this point Secretary and King Hussein left group for brief private conversation in                        Secretarys office When rest of group was invited to join them Secretary                        said he and His Majesty had discussed Jordans financial situation                        Secretary said he had assured King Hussein we want to do everything we can to help Jordan                        within the limits of our resourcesA February 7                            memorandum from Saunders to                                Scowcroft reported Kissingers statement that the US

million in total aid in 1973 He also suggested that it might be a good                            idea to promise the King an additional 15 million in budget support                            before

added he had pointed out that our financial problems are very difficult                        too perhaps even more difficult he said jocularly than Jordans Asst                        Secy Sisco

and military aid to                            Jordan and reiterated the US intention to request 40 million in grant                            military aid for Jordan in FY 1974 The

very impressed with work and planning that went into it17 Secretary remarked USG is very impressed                        at actions His Majestys Government had taken to eliminate fedayeen threat                        We feel this was very important Nothing has contributed more to stability                        in Jordan Secretary said we have told this to Lebanese have urged them to                        act against fedayeen also and it appears that they are doing so Secretary                        reiterated that USG wants to do everything                        it can to assist Jordan Hussein said                        that Jordan had no choice but to take the action it did against fedayeen He                        stressed that Jordan has no intention of readmitting fedayeen to its                        territory: We will never reopen our country to them Sisco asked how tight a rein Syrians are                        keeping on fedayeen King Hussein                        said Syrians are tightening up and have removed fedayeen from front line                        King stressed that in recent Cairo Defense Council Jordan did not accept                        return of fedayeen and did not agree to put its army under any other                            commandThe Arab Defense Council met in                            Cairo in JanuarySisco asked if there were a                        possibility for resumption of diplomatic relations with Egypt and Syria                        King Hussein replied he thought so                        Foreign Minister Abu Zaid responded                        that on basis of his contacts at Cairo meeting and elsewhere he thought                        prospects are reasonably good18 In closing Secretary reiterated USGs

SUMMARY. AGOSTINHO NETO ASKED JOAQUIM PINTO DE ANDRADE TO PARTICIPATE IN THE TRANSITIONAL GOVERNMENT. ANDRADE AND OTHER MEMBERS OF THE ""REVOLTA ACTIVA"" HAVE REFUSED TO COOPERATE WITH NETO UNLESS HE AGREES TO ACCEPT THEM AS A LEGITIMATE CURRENTO OF OPINION WITHIN THE PARTY. END SUMMARY.\n2. AFTER THE LUSAKA CONGRESS OF THE MPLA IN AUGUST OF 1974, NETO HELD AN INTERREGIONAL CONGRESS IN EASTERN ANGOLA IN SEPTEMBER, WHERE HE GATHERED TOGETHER LOYALISTS AND SET UP A NEW CENTRAL COMMITTEE. ASIDE FROM LUCIO LARA, NONE OF THE MEMBERS HAS MUCH REPUTATION OR EXPERIENCE. NO ONE DOUBTS LARS INTELLIGENCE, BUT HE IS SUPPOSED TO BE FLAWED BY A DEEP BITTERNESS AND A TERRIBLE DESIRE FOR REVENGE AGAINST WHITES. LOPO DE NASCIMENTO, THE MPLA MEMBER OF THE PRESIDENTIAL COUNCIL IS THOUGHT OF AS A PLEASANT YOUNG MAN, BUT HE HAS NOT STATURE, NO EXPERIENCE AND LITTLE INCLINATION TO STAND UP TO ANYBODY AT THIS POINT. CONFIDENTIAL ERMINIO ESCORCIO, ANOTHER MEMBER OF NETOS INNER GROUP IS DISMISSED BY SOME WHO KNOW HIM AS AN IMBECILE. NETO REALIZES THAT HS IS IN REAL TROUBLE FOR LACK OF GOOD PEOPLE AND IS TRYING TO INDUCE THE ANDRADE FACTION TO TAKE AN ACTIVE PART IN POLITICS.\n3. AS I HAVE PIECED TOGETHER THE STORY, NETO PASSED THE WORD TO JOAQUIM PINTO DE ANDRADE BEFORE OR DURING THE ALVOR CONFERENCE THAT HE WANTED HIM IN THE TRANSITIONAL GOVERNMENT, PROBABLY AS THE MPLA MEMBER OF THE PRESIDENTIAL COUNCIL, OR COLLEGIUM. ANDRADE SENT BACK WORD THAT HE WOULD ACCEPT ON THE CONDITION THAT THE ""REVOLTA ACTIVA"", OR ANDRADE FACTION, BE LEGITIMATIZED WITHIN THE PARTY AND THAT ITS VIEWS AND OPINIONS HAVE WEIGHT IN PARTY COUNCILS. NETO REFUSED AND WENT AHEAD WITH THE SELECTION OF THE PEOPLE NOW IN THE GOVERNMENT.\n4. A FEW DAYS AFTER HIS ARRIVAL IN LUANDA, NETO GRASPED THAT THINGS WERE NOT GOING WELL FOR MPLA AND HE CALLED SOME OLD FRIENDS AMONG THE REVOLTA ACTIVA AND ASKED TO TALK WITH THEM. THEY ALL REFUSED AND TOLD HIM TO TALK WITH ANDRADE. NETO THEN ARRANGED TO MEET WITH ANDRADE WHO BY THIS TIME HAD RETURNED TO LUANDA. NETO REITERATED HIS REQUEST THAT JOAQUIM PARTICIPATE. ANDRADE AGREED, BUT REITERATED HIS DEMAND THAT THE ENTIRE FACTION AND ITS OPINIONS BE ACCEPTED AND ADDED A FEW OTHERS.\n5. ANDRADE AND NETO AGREED TO NOMINATE DELEGATES TO NEGOTIATE A FORMULA ACCEPTABLE TO BOTH SIDES. THE ANDRADE FACTION HAS THREE PRINCIPAL DEMANDS: 1) EASE OUT LARA AND ESCORCIO; THEY NEED NOT NECESSARILY BE THROWN OUT OF THE PARTY, BUT THEY MUST BE PUT SOMEWHERE WHERE THEY WILL NOT HAVE MAJOR RESPONSIBILITIES;\n6. THE IMPLICATIONS TO MPLA OF THE NEGOTIATIONS ARE GREAT. NETO HAS NOBODY WITH ANY PRESTIGE OR CAPABILITY AND THE PARTY NEEDS THE ANDRADE FACTION IF MPLA IS TO HAVE A CHANCE AGAINST THE WELL ORGANIZED UNITA DRIVE FOR VOTES AND THE GROWING ACCEPTANCE OF FNLA AMONG BOTH BLACKS AND WHITES. THE ANDRADE PEOPLE HAVE NO CONFIDENTIAL INTENTION OF LEAVING THE PARTY APPARATUS IN THE HANDS OF NETO IF THEY CAN HELP IT. THEY HOPE TO BE ABLE TO REMOVE HIM FROM THE CENTER AND RELEGATE HIM TO THE ROLE OF PARTY HERO AND ELDER STATESMAN. I HAVE REAL DOUBTS THAT THE ANDRADE FACTION CAN TAKE AWAY FROM NETO ALL THE LEVERS OF POWER. THEY HAVE NOT SHOWN MUCH STOMACH FOR POLITICAL INFIGHTING, WHILE NETO WILL STOP AT NOTHING TO RETAIN POWER. ANDRADE AND COMPANY DO HAVE A USEFUL WEAPON - DENIAL - NOW THAT NETO SEES HIS PRESENT CADRE IS NOT UP TO THE JOB THAT MUST BE DONE. IT IS A SAD COMMENTARY ON NETOS LEADERSHIP THAT MPLA, WHICH WAS TOUTED AS HAVING THE BEST TALENT AND THE GREATEST DEPTH AMONG THE LIBERATION MOVEMENTS NOT ONLY IS THE WEAKEST GROUP IN THE GOVERNMENT, IT HAS THE REPUTATION OF A GANG OF TOUGHS.

2,0.15248322917831825,25110 Subject: Secretarys Meeting With King Hussein1 Summary Secretary met with King Hussein for working lunch and talk at Department February 6                        Meeting was very cordial Secretary stressed USG attaches great importance to process of negotiation and                        sees no substitute for negotiations in finding solution to Middle East                        problem Secretary indicated our concern in this regard is mainly with                        Egypt since Jordan has made clear its readiness to talk Secretary pointed                        out USG wants to be helpful but contrary                        to belief of some we cannot impose a solution We think that if agreement                        could be reached between Egypt and Israel on opening of Suez Canal it would                        generate momentum for settlement between Jordan and Israel Secretary                        assured King Hussein we have                        JordanianIsraeli side of problem very much in mind King raised Jordanian                        assistance requests with Secretary in brief private meeting following                        luncheon and Secretary said we would do all we can to help Jordan within                        limit of our resources which he noted are currently under great                        pressure2 King Hussein was accompanied at                        meeting by Royal Court Minister Amer                            Khammash Foreign Minister Salah                            Abu Zaid Political Adviser Zaid                            Rifai Minister of Finance Farid                            alSadad General Ben Shaker and Jordanian Ambassador to                            USMufti On US side Deputy Secretary                            Rush AID Administrator Hannah Under Secretary Tarr Asst Secy Sisco Ambassador Brown and ARN Country Director Korn were present Luncheon and meeting afterwards were very                        cordial and warm and lasted just over two hours3 Secretary opened by remarking that we have come to agreement in VietNam                        and have created conditions in which there can be peace if the parties want                        it Secretary pointed out that in every area of world except the Middle East                        we have been able to get parties to talk in Germany in Korea and in                        VietNam It is difficult to see how any progress can be made toward a                        Middle East solution unless Arabs and Israelis are ready to do the same as                        other parties to major world conflicts Secretary said he wanted to make                        clear that his remarks about need for negotiations were not addressed to                        Jordanians for we know that Jordan is ready to talk But he wanted to                        stress that the Middle East conflict is far too complex to solve without an                        active exchange of ideas between the parties Rifai referred to his                        recent visit to Cairo and his conversation with President Sadat and said that Sadat is ready to negotiate but needs a                        prior commitment from Israelis regarding the line of withdrawal Rifai said                        President Sadat is neither willing                        nor able to discuss concessions with Israelis He cannot give up sovereignty                        over any part of Sinai4 Secretary replied that it just does not make any sense to ask other side                        for commitments as precondition for entering into negotiations Suppose we                        had done that in our negotiations with Russians We would never have reached                        agreement with them on Berlin or on SALT                        Deputy Secretary Rush pointed out                        that it took 18 months and difficult discussions to reach agreement on                        Berlin and that no progress would ever have been made had we not been                        prepared to participate in give and take of negotiations Foreign Minister                            Abu Zaid interjected that it is                        Israelis not Arabs who put conditions on negotiations Israelis say they                        are ready to conduct negotiations provided that Jerusalem Sharm alSheikh                        and Golan Heights will not be subject to negotiation5 King Hussein said his feeling is                        that so many agreements have now taken place throughout the world that                        Middle East is only remaining problem It is imperative now that world turn                        its attention to Middle East and that progress be made King Hussein stressed importance of action now                        Secretary pointed out that in every negotiation each side has its own                        position and there is nothing unusual in one or both sides stating those                        positions What is unusual is for one side to say to other that it must give                        in before there can even be talks Secretary noted that Israel states that                        its principal concern is security Egypt on other hand tells Israel that it                        does not need to worry about security once an agreement has been signed                        Secretary said he saw no reason why Israeli and Egyptian positions need be                        irreconcilable However problems are so complex that it is impossible to                        decide them at any one time If some progress can be made toward a Suez                        agreement Secretary said then momentum will be developed toward solution                        of other aspects of problem6 Rifai took issue with Secretary on                        foregoing and said Egypt would find itself weaker and further from achieving                        a lasting settlement if Suez agreement is concluded Secretary said he                        disagreed absolutely If an agreement is reached on Suez this will very                        definitely create a new impetus for negotiations Additionally since                        Egyptians would cross to East Bank of canal in framework of a Suez                        agreement he could not see how anyone could say that Egypt would be weaker                        militarily Rifai objected that Egyptian military forces would not cross                        canal Secretary pointed out that even so there would still be Egyptians on                        East Bank of canal for first time since 1967 and Israelis would with draw from the Bar Lev LineThe BarLev Line named for Israeli Chief of Staff                            Haim BarLev was a chain of fortifications that Israel built along the                            eastern coast of the Suez Canal after it captured the Sinai Peninsula                            from Egypt during the 1967 war In these circumstances how could                        anyone say that Egypt would be weaker Egypt would be much better off                        because world would want to keep canal open and would put pressure on Israel                        to move forward to a full settlement and not do anything which would place                        canal in danger Moreover Secretary pointed out there would be some kind                        of force separating two sides and Egypt would receive a commitment from                        Israel to continue negotiations for a full settlement Secretary said he was                        sure Egypt could make a good settlement with Israel through negotiations a                        much better one than could be achieved by any other means Rifai said that in event of an                        IsraeliEgyptian settlement on canal Jordans position would be much                        weaker Secretary said he did not agree Rifai replied main problem is not the canal but Jerusalem                        and West Bank7 King Hussein said Sadat has begun recently to think of war                        as a serious alternative even though following Russian withdrawal he may                        now be less capable of undertaking it Problem is that Sadat feels himself unable to make                        concessions to Israel which would be needed for a negotiated settlement but                        feels under pressure to do something Sadat seems to think that war if started can be kept under                        control and would not get too far out of hand Hussein said what he did not understand is how Sadat expects Israel will play the game of                        war with him in accordance with his own rules8 The Secretary said what is at issue basically in discussions between Egypt                        and Israel on a Suez agreement is the difference between further                        withdrawal and total withdrawal Israel is ready to give a commitment for                        further withdrawal but not for total withdrawal Secretary wondered if                        it might not be best to leave this issue ambiguous as was done in Resolution                        242 and on some issues in the Vietnam agreement The Secretary noted that                        Vietnam agreement would never have been reached had parties insisted on                        defining everything precisely in order to reach agreement certain things                        have to be left ambiguous Rifai                        objected that if there is going to be peace in the Middle East there must be                        total Israeli withdrawal The question is whether Israel is going to                        withdraw totally or not Rifai                        insisted it is not possible for Sadat or any other Arab leader to concede territory to                        Israel The Secretary replied that what Rifai had said is not borne out                        anywhere in history There has never been a war that was not followed by                        territorial changes Moreover wars have always been followed by long                        periods in which the situation was unclear This the Secretary noted was                        true even of Second World War where Allied victory was completely clearcut Rifai said that what Secretary was in effect saying was that                        he agreed with Egyptians when they say that what was taken by force must be                        regained by force No not at all Secretary replied Secretary pointed out                        that there has almost never in history been a situation in which territory                        lost in a war was regained by force soon thereafter9 King Hussein said he feels main                        problem is really JordanianIsraeli side of question Whether a possible                        agreement between Egypt and Israel will help he did not know though he had                        no objection to an effort being made for such an agreement King Hussein said he felt Jerusalem was intended                        to be a city of peace not one of war and he did not see any reason it                        should not be possible to work out some sort of solution in regard to                        Jerusalem On broader matter of negotiations King Hussein pointed out that in all other major                        areas where agreement had been reached in Germany Vietnam and other                        places the matter of reaching a settlement had not been left entirely to                        the parties concerned The rest of the world had helped the parties to reach                        an understanding and in many cases the worlds help had been significant if                        not crucial King Hussein said he                        felt the same must apply to the Middle East The parties ability to help                        themselves in the Middle East conflict is limited and the world must give                        them as much support as possible10 Secretary said he agreed entirely with King Hussein and had two comments: First is that US attaches tremendous importance to the                        process of negotiations Mr Rifai                        had pointed out that positions of two sides are intractable but in our view                        that is precisely why there must be negotiations Second point Secretary                        said is that one of the difficulties is that there is a feeling that USG can solve the Middle East problems if it                        wants to Secretary emphasized that this is not true USG can be helpful in framework of negotiating                        process but idea that USG can impose a                        solution is false Secretary pointed out that USG has greatest interest in Jordan and feels strongest                        friendship and support for King Hussein But despite this and all importance we attach to a                        settlement we are unable to impose one on the parties Secretary stressed                        that he did not want to be critical of President Sadat but we do think Sadat is making a mistake in refusing to                        negotiate We feel Sadat had done                        many good things and we want him to be successful We believe if                        negotiations could get started between Egypt and Israel Egypt could get a                        much better solution than it could hope for by any other means King                            Hussein said that in any event he                        thought Jordans case was very strong Secretary noted that when we talk to                        His Majesty about the need for negotiations we are talking to the converted                        since King Hussein has been very                        openminded on this subject Under Secretary Tarr noted that settlement which was accepted by North and                        South Vietnamese would have been viewed by both sides as completely                        unacceptable at outset of negotiations11 King Hussein said he believes                        Jordan must do utmost to achieve a solution but whatever solution is reached                        must be one which will be accepted by people and one which can be beginning                        of real progress and stability Secretary and Deputy Secretary congratulated                        King on his statesmanship and remarked that his example is one which should                        be followed by Egyptians Assistant Secretary Sisco asked if King were to find some glimmer of flexibility                        in the Israeli position how would he feel about the question of which side                        there should be a settlement with first Egypt or Jordan Sisco said we have always thought a Suez                        agreement might be helpful to His Majesty in reaching an agreement with                        Israel King Hussein replied that if                        there were a glimmer of hope he would do everything possible to reach an                        agreement with Israel King said it of no importance to him whether Jordan                        is first second or third to sign agreement with Israel as long as                        settlement is acceptable If a Suez agreement would help in creating a good                        atmosphere that would be fine the King said but Jordan thinks Jerusalem                        and West Bank are the main issues Secretary asked if it would be helpful if                        discussions were to start at same time between Jordan and Israel and Egypt                        and Israel The King responded affirmatively FonMinAbu Zaid said it is important                        however that in any such negotiations the parties not be left alone                        Someone should be there to help them reach agreement12 King Hussein asked Secretarys                        evaluation of Soviet intentions with regard to Middle East conflict                        Secretary said we do not think Soviets are trying to stimulate a renewal of                        hostilities Soviets were very embarrassed by their expulsion from Egypt and                        are now trying to recover the lost ground in Syria and Iraq We do not think                        the Soviets will try to promote negotiations at the outset at least but if                        negotiations get started they might change their attitude We believe                        Soviets welcome continuation of ceasefire King Hussein asked whether opening of Suez Canal would not be to                        advantage of USSR Secretary said there                        would be some advantage to Soviets but we feel that advantages to US would be even greater USG has many and broad interests in Middle                        East and we have every reason to want a settlement Only problem we have in                        our relations with Arabs is Israel Otherwise we get along fine with Arabs                        Secretary said much better than Soviets do13 Secretary remarked that Soviets are competing with China in Middle East                        and for this reason they may feel they have to continue to support Arab                        positions Secretary said he thought Soviets might be pleased to have a                        settlement but for reason he had just cited might find it difficult to be                        active in promoting one King Hussein                        said he thought Soviets would want a degree of trouble and chaos in Middle                        East because they profit from it King noted Soviets are putting a lot of                        equipment into Iraq and have delivered large amounts of military hardware                            to Syria They would like to have                        Syria and Iraq together under USSRs                        aegis14 Finance Minister Saad said that with His Majestys permission he wanted                        to say a word about Israeli actions in Jerusalem and on West Bank Finance                        Minister noted he had been Governor of Palestine in Mandate times and he                        knew Israelis well and had learned their language He could understand how                        there could be negotiations between two equal partners but felt that present                        situation was different Israelis are laying claim to all parts of West Bank                        and are setting up settlements everywhere Finance Minister said he would                        like to ask how Israeli withdrawal can be visualized when Israelis have put                        up so many settlements Secretary said problem is difficult one there is no                        doubt about that But the longer the delay in beginning negotiations the                        more difficult it will become Nothing is gained by delaying It may be that                        Egypt and Israel cannot work out an agreement but even if that is case it                        will not hurt to try Should an agreement be reached Secretary said he was                        sure it would help prospects for an agreement between Jordan and Israel                        Secretary pointed out that USG does not                        support Israels action in establishing settlements on West Bank and has                        said so publicly This USG position has not                        stopped Israelis but it may have slowed them down15 Asst Secy Sisco said one of                        reasons USG emphasizes Suez agreement is                        that if such agreement were to be reached it would create added incentive on                        Israel to face up to compromises needed to reach agreement with Jordan                            Sisco said that it is this                        Jordanian side of problem which we have in mind when we say we do not see                        Suez agreement as an end in itself Secretary said this is absolutely right                        If there is agreement between Israel and Egypt USG would be in much better position to be helpful on other                        issues16 At this point Secretary and King Hussein left group for brief private conversation in                        Secretarys office When rest of group was invited to join them Secretary                        said he and His Majesty had discussed Jordans financial situation                        Secretary said he had assured King Hussein we want to do everything we can to help Jordan                        within

million in total aid in 1973 He also suggested that it might be a good                            idea to promise the King an additional 15 million in budget support                            before

and military aid to                            Jordan and reiterated the US intention to request 40 million in grant                            military aid for Jordan in FY 1974 The

very impressed with work and planning that went into it17 Secretary remarked USG is very impressed                        at actions His Majestys Government had taken to eliminate fedayeen threat                        We feel this was very important Nothing has contributed more to stability                        in Jordan Secretary said we have told this to Lebanese have urged them to                        act against fedayeen also and it appears that they are doing so Secretary                        reiterated that USG wants to do everything                        it can to assist Jordan Hussein said                        that Jordan had no choice but to take the action it did against fedayeen He                        stressed that Jordan has no intention of readmitting fedayeen to its                        territory: We will never reopen our country to them Sisco asked how tight a rein Syrians are                        keeping on fedayeen King Hussein                        said Syrians are tightening up and have removed fedayeen from front line                        King stressed that in recent Cairo Defense Council Jordan did not accept                        return of fedayeen and did not agree to put its army under any other                            commandThe Arab Defense Council met in                            Cairo in JanuarySisco asked if there were a                        possibility for resumption of diplomatic relations with Egypt and Syria                        King Hussein replied he thought so                        Foreign Minister Abu Zaid responded                        that on basis of his contacts at Cairo meeting and elsewhere he thought                        prospects are reasonably good18 In closing Secretary reiterated USGs

was very cordial Secretary stressed USG attaches great importance to process of negotiation and                        sees no substitute for negotiations in finding solution to Middle East                        problem Secretary indicated our concern in this regard is mainly with                        Egypt since Jordan has made clear its readiness to talk Secretary pointed                        out USG wants to be helpful but contrary                        to belief of some we cannot impose a solution We think that if agreement                        could be reached between Egypt and Israel on opening of Suez Canal it would                        generate momentum for settlement between Jordan and Israel Secretary                        assured King Hussein we have                        JordanianIsraeli side of problem very much in mind King raised Jordanian                        assistance requests with Secretary in brief private meeting following                        luncheon and Secretary said we would do all we can to help Jordan within                        limit of our resources which he noted are currently under great                        pressure2 King Hussein was accompanied at                        meeting by Royal Court Minister Amer                            Khammash Foreign Minister Salah                            Abu Zaid Political Adviser Zaid                            Rifai Minister of Finance Farid                            alSadad General Ben Shaker and Jordanian Ambassador to                            USMufti On US side Deputy Secretary                            Rush AID Administrator Hannah Under Secretary Tarr Asst Secy Sisco Ambassador Brown and ARN Country Director Korn were present Luncheon and meeting afterwards were very                        cordial and warm and lasted just over two hours3 Secretary opened by remarking that we have come to agreement in VietNam                        and have created conditions in which there can be peace if the parties want                        it Secretary pointed out that in every area of world except the Middle East                        we have been able to get parties to talk in Germany in Korea and in                        VietNam It is difficult to see how any progress can be made toward a                        Middle East solution unless Arabs and Israelis are ready to do the same as                        other parties to major world conflicts Secretary said he wanted to make                        clear that his remarks about need for negotiations were not addressed to                        Jordanians for we know that Jordan is ready to talk But he wanted to                        stress that the Middle East conflict is far too complex to solve without an                        active exchange of ideas between the parties Rifai referred to his                        recent visit to Cairo and his conversation with President Sadat and said that Sadat is ready to negotiate but needs a                        prior commitment from Israelis regarding the line of withdrawal Rifai said                        President Sadat is neither willing                        nor able to discuss concessions with Israelis He cannot give up sovereignty                        over any part of Sinai4 Secretary replied that it just does not make any sense to ask other side                        for commitments as precondition for entering into negotiations Suppose we                        had done that in our negotiations with Russians We would never have reached                        agreement with them on Berlin or on SALT                        Deputy Secretary Rush pointed out                        that it took 18 months and difficult discussions to reach agreement on                        Berlin and that no progress would ever have been made had we not been                        prepared to participate in give and take of negotiations Foreign Minister                            Abu Zaid interjected that it is                        Israelis not Arabs who put conditions on negotiations Israelis say they                        are ready to conduct negotiations provided that Jerusalem Sharm alSheikh                        and Golan Heights will not be subject to negotiation5 King Hussein said his feeling is                        that so many agreements have now taken place throughout the world that                        Middle East is only remaining problem It is imperative now that world turn                        its attention to Middle East and that progress be made King Hussein stressed importance of action now                        Secretary pointed out that in every negotiation each side has its own                        position and there is nothing unusual in one or both sides stating those                        positions What is unusual is for one side to say to other that it must give                        in before there can even be talks Secretary noted that Israel states that                        its principal concern is security Egypt on other hand tells Israel that it                        does not need to worry about security once an agreement has been signed                        Secretary said he saw no reason why Israeli and Egyptian positions need be                        irreconcilable However problems are so complex that it is impossible to                        decide them at any one time If some progress can be made toward a Suez                        agreement Secretary said then momentum will be developed toward solution                        of other aspects of problem6 Rifai took issue with Secretary on                        foregoing and said Egypt would find itself weaker and further from achieving                        a lasting settlement if Suez agreement is concluded Secretary said he                        disagreed absolutely If an agreement is reached on Suez this will very                        definitely create a new impetus for negotiations Additionally since                        Egyptians would cross to East Bank of canal in framework of a Suez                        agreement he could not see how anyone could say that Egypt would be weaker                        militarily Rifai objected that Egyptian military forces would not cross                        canal Secretary pointed out that even so there would still be Egyptians on                        East Bank of canal for first time since 1967 and Israelis would with draw from the Bar Lev LineThe BarLev Line named for Israeli Chief of Staff                            Haim BarLev was a chain of fortifications that Israel built along the                            eastern coast of the Suez Canal after it captured the Sinai Peninsula                            from Egypt during the 1967 war In these circumstances how could                        anyone say that Egypt would be weaker Egypt would be much better off                        because world would want to keep canal open and would put pressure on Israel                        to move forward to a full settlement and not do anything which would place                        canal in danger Moreover Secretary pointed out there would be some kind                        of force separating two sides and Egypt would receive a commitment from                        Israel to continue negotiations for a full settlement Secretary said he was                        sure Egypt could make a good settlement with Israel through negotiations a                        much better one than could be achieved by any other means Rifai said that in event of an                        IsraeliEgyptian settlement on canal Jordans position would be much                        weaker Secretary said he did not agree Rifai replied main problem is not the canal but Jerusalem                        and West Bank7 King Hussein said Sadat has begun recently to think of war                        as a serious alternative even though following Russian withdrawal he may                        now be less capable of undertaking it Problem is that Sadat feels himself unable to make                        concessions to Israel which would be needed for a negotiated settlement but                        feels under pressure to do something Sadat seems to think that war if started can be kept under                        control and would not get too far out of hand Hussein said what he did not understand is how Sadat expects Israel will play the game of                        war with him in accordance with his own rules8 The Secretary said what is at issue basically in discussions between Egypt                        and Israel on a Suez agreement is the difference between further                        withdrawal and total withdrawal Israel is ready to give a commitment for                        further withdrawal but not for total withdrawal Secretary wondered if                        it might not be best to leave this issue ambiguous as was done in Resolution                        242 and on some issues in the Vietnam agreement The Secretary noted that                        Vietnam agreement would never have been reached had parties insisted on                        defining everything precisely in order to reach agreement certain things                        have to be left ambiguous Rifai                        objected that if there is going to be peace in the Middle East there must be                        total Israeli withdrawal The question is whether Israel is going to                        withdraw totally or not Rifai                        insisted it is not possible for Sadat or any other Arab leader to concede territory to                        Israel The Secretary replied that what Rifai had said is not borne out                        anywhere in history There has never been a war that was not followed by                        territorial changes Moreover wars have always been followed by long                        periods in which the situation was unclear This the Secretary noted was                        true even of Second World War where Allied victory was completely clearcut Rifai said that what Secretary was in effect saying was that                        he agreed with Egyptians when they say that what was taken by force must be                        regained by force No not at all Secretary replied Secretary pointed out                        that there has almost never in history been a situation in which territory                        lost in a war was regained by force soon thereafter9 King Hussein said he feels main                        problem is really JordanianIsraeli side of question Whether a possible                        agreement between Egypt and Israel will help he did not know though he had                        no objection to an effort being made for such an agreement King Hussein said he felt Jerusalem was intended                        to be a city of peace not one of war and he did not see any reason it                        should not be possible to work out some sort of solution in regard to                        Jerusalem On broader matter of negotiations King Hussein pointed out that in all other major                        areas where agreement had been reached in Germany Vietnam and other                        places the matter of reaching a settlement had not been left entirely to                        the parties concerned The rest of the world had helped the parties to reach                        an understanding and in many cases the worlds help had been significant if                        not crucial King Hussein said he                        felt the same must apply to the Middle East The parties ability to help                        themselves in the Middle East conflict is limited and the world must give                        them as much support as possible10 Secretary said he agreed entirely with King Hussein and had two comments: First is that US attaches tremendous importance to the                        process of negotiations Mr Rifai                        had pointed out that positions of two sides are intractable but in our view                        that is precisely why there must be negotiations Second point Secretary                        said is that one of the difficulties is that there is a feeling that USG can solve the Middle East problems if it                        wants to Secretary emphasized that this is not true USG can be helpful in framework of negotiating                        process but idea that USG can impose a                        solution is false Secretary pointed out that USG has greatest interest in Jordan and feels strongest                        friendship and support for King Hussein But despite this and all importance we attach to a                        settlement we are unable to impose one on the parties Secretary stressed                        that he did not want to be critical of President Sadat but we do think Sadat is making a mistake in refusing to                        negotiate We feel Sadat had done                        many good things and we want him to be successful We believe if                        negotiations could get started between Egypt and Israel Egypt could get a                        much better solution than it could hope for by any other means King                            Hussein said that in any event he                        thought Jordans case was very strong Secretary noted that when we talk to                        His Majesty about the need for negotiations we are talking to the converted                        since King Hussein has been very                        openminded on this subject Under Secretary Tarr noted that settlement which was accepted by North and                        South Vietnamese would have been viewed by both sides as completely                        unacceptable at outset of negotiations11 King Hussein said he believes                        Jordan must do utmost to achieve a solution but whatever solution is reached                        must be one which will be accepted by people and one which can be beginning                        of real progress and stability Secretary and Deputy Secretary congratulated                        King on his statesmanship and remarked that his example is one which should                        be followed by Egyptians Assistant Secretary Sisco asked if King were to find some glimmer of flexibility                        in the Israeli position how would he feel about the question of which side                        there should be a settlement with first Egypt or Jordan Sisco said we have always thought a Suez                        agreement might be helpful to His Majesty in reaching an agreement with                        Israel King Hussein replied that if                        there were a glimmer of hope he would do everything possible to reach an                        agreement with Israel King said it of no importance to him whether Jordan                        is first second or third to sign agreement with Israel as long as                        settlement is acceptable If a Suez agreement would help in creating a good                        atmosphere that would be fine the King said but Jordan thinks Jerusalem                        and West Bank are the main issues Secretary asked if it would be helpful if                        discussions were to start at same time between Jordan and Israel and Egypt                        and Israel The King responded affirmatively FonMinAbu Zaid said it is important                        however that in any such negotiations the parties not be left alone                        Someone should be there to help them reach agreement12 King Hussein asked Secretarys                        evaluation of Soviet intentions with regard to Middle East conflict                        Secretary said we do not think Soviets are trying to stimulate a renewal of                        hostilities Soviets were very embarrassed by their expulsion from Egypt and                        are now trying to recover the lost ground in Syria and Iraq We do not think                        the Soviets will try to promote negotiations at the outset at least but if                        negotiations get started they might change their attitude We believe                        Soviets welcome continuation of ceasefire King Hussein asked whether opening of Suez Canal would not be to                        advantage of USSR Secretary said there                        would be some advantage to Soviets but we feel that advantages to US would be even greater USG has many and broad interests in Middle                        East and we have every reason to want a settlement Only problem we have in                        our relations with Arabs is Israel Otherwise we get along fine with Arabs                        Secretary said much better than Soviets do13 Secretary remarked that Soviets are competing with China in Middle East                        and for this reason they may feel they have to continue to support Arab                        positions Secretary said he thought Soviets might be pleased to have a                        settlement but for reason he had just cited might find it difficult to be                        active in promoting one King Hussein                        said he thought Soviets would want a degree of trouble and chaos in Middle                        East because they profit from it King noted Soviets are putting a lot of                        equipment into Iraq and have delivered large amounts of military hardware                            to Syria They would like to have                        Syria and Iraq together under USSRs                        aegis14 Finance Minister Saad said that with His Majestys permission he wanted                        to say a word about Israeli actions in Jerusalem and on West Bank Finance                        Minister noted he had been Governor of Palestine in Mandate times and he                        knew Israelis well and had learned their language He could understand how                        there could be negotiations between two equal partners but felt that present                        situation was different Israelis are laying claim to all parts of West Bank                        and are setting up settlements everywhere Finance Minister said he would                        like to ask how Israeli withdrawal can be visualized when Israelis have put                        up so many settlements Secretary said problem is difficult one there is no                        doubt about that But the longer the delay in beginning negotiations the                        more difficult it will become Nothing is gained by delaying It may be that                        Egypt and Israel cannot work out an agreement but even if that is case it                        will not hurt to try Should an agreement be reached Secretary said he was                        sure it would help prospects for an agreement between Jordan and Israel                        Secretary pointed out that USG does not                        support Israels action in establishing settlements on West Bank and has                        said so publicly This USG position has not                        stopped Israelis but it may have slowed them down15 Asst Secy Sisco said one of                        reasons USG emphasizes Suez agreement is                        that if such agreement were to be reached it would create added incentive on                        Israel to face up to compromises needed to reach agreement with Jordan                            Sisco said that it is this                        Jordanian side of problem which we have in mind when we say we do not see                        Suez agreement as an end in itself Secretary said this is absolutely right                        If there is agreement between Israel and Egypt USG would be in much better position to be helpful on other                        issues16 At this point Secretary and King Hussein left group for brief private conversation in                        Secretarys office When rest of group was invited to join them Secretary                        said he and His Majesty had discussed Jordans financial situation                        Secretary said he had assured King Hussein we want to do everything we can to help Jordan                        within the limits of our resourcesA February 7                            memorandum from Saunders to                                Scowcroft reported Kissingers statement that the US

million in total aid in 1973 He also suggested that it might be a good                            idea to promise the King an additional 15 million in budget support                            before

and military aid to                            Jordan and reiterated the US intention to request 40 million in grant                            military aid for Jordan in FY 1974 The

very impressed with work and planning that went into it17 Secretary remarked USG is very impressed                        at actions His Majestys Government had taken to eliminate fedayeen threat                        We feel this was very important Nothing has contributed more to stability                        in Jordan Secretary said we have told this to Lebanese have urged them to                        act against fedayeen also and it appears that they are doing so Secretary                        reiterated that USG wants to do everything                        it can to assist Jordan Hussein said                        that Jordan had no choice but to take the action it did against fedayeen He                        stressed that Jordan has no intention of readmitting fedayeen to its                        territory: We will never reopen our country to them Sisco asked how tight a rein Syrians are                        keeping on fedayeen King Hussein                        said Syrians are tightening up and have removed fedayeen from front line                        King stressed that in recent Cairo Defense Council Jordan did not accept                        return of fedayeen and did not agree to put its army under any other                            commandThe Arab Defense Council met in                            Cairo in JanuarySisco asked if there were a                        possibility for resumption of diplomatic relations with Egypt and Syria                        King Hussein replied he thought so                        Foreign Minister Abu Zaid responded                        that on basis of his contacts at Cairo meeting and elsewhere he thought                        prospects are reasonably good18 In closing Secretary reiterated USGs

was very cordial Secretary stressed USG attaches great importance to process of negotiation and                        sees no substitute for negotiations in finding solution to Middle East                        problem Secretary indicated our concern in this regard is mainly with                        Egypt since Jordan has made clear its readiness to talk Secretary pointed                        out USG wants to be helpful but contrary                        to belief of some we cannot impose a solution We think that if agreement                        could be reached between Egypt and Israel on opening of Suez Canal it would                        generate momentum for settlement between Jordan and Israel Secretary                        assured King Hussein we have                        JordanianIsraeli side of problem very much in mind King raised Jordanian                        assistance requests with Secretary in brief private meeting following                        luncheon and Secretary said we would do all we can to help Jordan within                        limit of our resources which he noted are currently under great                        pressure2 King Hussein was accompanied at                        meeting by Royal Court Minister Amer                            Khammash Foreign Minister Salah                            Abu Zaid Political Adviser Zaid                            Rifai Minister of Finance Farid                            alSadad General Ben Shaker and Jordanian Ambassador to                            USMufti On US side Deputy Secretary                            Rush AID Administrator Hannah Under Secretary Tarr Asst Secy Sisco Ambassador Brown and ARN Country Director Korn were present Luncheon and meeting afterwards were very                        cordial and warm and lasted just over two hours3 Secretary opened by remarking that we have come to agreement in VietNam                        and have created conditions in which there can be peace if the parties want                        it Secretary pointed out that in every area of world except the Middle East                        we have been able to get parties to talk in Germany in Korea and in                        VietNam It is difficult to see how any progress can be made toward a                        Middle East solution unless Arabs and Israelis are ready to do the same as                        other parties to major world conflicts Secretary said he wanted to make                        clear that his remarks about need for negotiations were not addressed to                        Jordanians for we know that Jordan is ready to talk But he wanted to                        stress that the Middle East conflict is far too complex to solve without an                        active exchange of ideas between the parties Rifai referred to his                        recent visit to Cairo and his conversation with President Sadat and said that Sadat is ready to negotiate but needs a                        prior commitment from Israelis regarding the line of withdrawal Rifai said                        President Sadat is neither willing                        nor able to discuss concessions with Israelis He cannot give up sovereignty                        over any part of Sinai4 Secretary replied that it just does not make any sense to ask other side                        for commitments as precondition for entering into negotiations Suppose we                        had done that in our negotiations with Russians We would never have reached                        agreement with them on Berlin or on SALT                        Deputy Secretary Rush pointed out                        that it took 18 months and difficult discussions to reach agreement on                        Berlin and that no progress would ever have been made had we not been                        prepared to participate in give and take of negotiations Foreign Minister                            Abu Zaid interjected that it is                        Israelis not Arabs who put conditions on negotiations Israelis say they                        are ready to conduct negotiations provided that Jerusalem Sharm alSheikh                        and Golan Heights will not be subject to negotiation5 King Hussein said his feeling is                        that so many agreements have now taken place throughout the world that                        Middle East is only remaining problem It is imperative now that world turn                        its attention to Middle East and that progress be made King Hussein stressed importance of action now                        Secretary pointed out that in every negotiation each side has its own                        position and there is nothing unusual in one or both sides stating those                        positions What is unusual is for one side to say to other that it must give                        in before there can even be talks Secretary noted that Israel states that                        its principal concern is security Egypt on other hand tells Israel that it                        does not need to worry about security once an agreement has been signed                        Secretary said he saw no reason why Israeli and Egyptian positions need be                        irreconcilable However problems are so complex that it is impossible to                        decide them at any one time If some progress can be made toward a Suez                        agreement Secretary said then momentum will be developed toward solution                        of other aspects of problem6 Rifai took issue with Secretary on                        foregoing and said Egypt would find itself weaker and further from achieving                        a lasting settlement if Suez agreement is concluded Secretary said he                        disagreed absolutely If an agreement is reached on Suez this will very                        definitely create a new impetus for negotiations Additionally since                        Egyptians would cross to East Bank of canal in framework of a Suez                        agreement he could not see how anyone could say that Egypt would be weaker                        militarily Rifai objected that Egyptian military forces would not cross                        canal Secretary pointed out that even so there would still be Egyptians on                        East Bank of canal for first time since 1967 and Israelis would with draw from the Bar Lev LineThe BarLev Line named for Israeli Chief of Staff                            Haim BarLev was a chain of fortifications that Israel built along the                            eastern coast of the Suez Canal after it captured the Sinai Peninsula                            from Egypt during the 1967 war In these circumstances how could                        anyone say that Egypt would be weaker Egypt would be much better off                        because world would want to keep canal open and would put pressure on Israel                        to move forward to a full settlement and not do anything which would place                        canal in danger Moreover Secretary pointed out there would be some kind                        of force separating two sides and Egypt would receive a commitment from                        Israel to continue negotiations for a full settlement Secretary said he was                        sure Egypt could make a good settlement with Israel through negotiations a                        much better one than could be achieved by any other means Rifai said that in event of an                        IsraeliEgyptian settlement on canal Jordans position would be much                        weaker Secretary said he did not agree Rifai replied main problem is not the canal but Jerusalem                        and West Bank7 King Hussein said Sadat has begun recently to think of war                        as a serious alternative even though following Russian withdrawal he may                        now be less capable of undertaking it Problem is that Sadat feels himself unable to make                        concessions to Israel which would be needed for a negotiated settlement but                        feels under pressure to do something Sadat seems to think that war if started can be kept under                        control and would not get too far out of hand Hussein said what he did not understand is how Sadat expects Israel will play the game of                        war with him in accordance with his own rules8 The Secretary said what is at issue basically in discussions between Egypt                        and Israel on a Suez agreement is the difference between further                        withdrawal and total withdrawal Israel is ready to give a commitment for                        further withdrawal but not for total withdrawal Secretary wondered if                        it might not be best to leave this issue ambiguous as was done in Resolution                        242 and on some issues in the Vietnam agreement The Secretary noted that                        Vietnam agreement would never have been reached had parties insisted on                        defining everything precisely in order to reach agreement certain things                        have to be left ambiguous Rifai                        objected that if there is going to be peace in the Middle East there must be                        total Israeli withdrawal The question is whether Israel is going to                        withdraw totally or not Rifai                        insisted it is not possible for Sadat or any other Arab leader to concede territory to                        Israel The Secretary replied that what Rifai had said is not borne out                        anywhere in history There has never been a war that was not followed by                        territorial changes Moreover wars have always been followed by long                        periods in which the situation was unclear This the Secretary noted was                        true even of Second World War where Allied victory was completely clearcut Rifai said that what Secretary was in effect saying was that                        he agreed with Egyptians when they say that what was taken by force must be                        regained by force No not at all Secretary replied Secretary pointed out                        that there has almost never in history been a situation in which territory                        lost in a war was regained by force soon thereafter9 King Hussein said he feels main                        problem is really JordanianIsraeli side of question Whether a possible                        agreement between Egypt and Israel will help he did not know though he had                        no objection to an effort being made for such an agreement King Hussein said he felt Jerusalem was intended                        to be a city of peace not one of war and he did not see any reason it                        should not be possible to work out some sort of solution in regard to                        Jerusalem On broader matter of negotiations King Hussein pointed out that in all other major                        areas where agreement had been reached in Germany Vietnam and other                        places the matter of reaching a settlement had not been left entirely to                        the parties concerned The rest of the world had helped the parties to reach                        an understanding and in many cases the worlds help had been significant if                        not crucial King Hussein said he                        felt the same must apply to the Middle East The parties ability to help                        themselves in the Middle East conflict is limited and the world must give                        them as much support as possible10 Secretary said he agreed entirely with King Hussein and had two comments: First is that US attaches tremendous importance to the                        process of negotiations Mr Rifai                        had pointed out that positions of two sides are intractable but in our view                        that is precisely why there must be negotiations Second point Secretary                        said is that one of the difficulties is that there is a feeling that USG can solve the Middle East problems if it                        wants to Secretary emphasized that this is not true USG can be helpful in framework of negotiating                        process but idea that USG can impose a                        solution is false Secretary pointed out that USG has greatest interest in Jordan and feels strongest                        friendship and support for King Hussein But despite this and all importance we attach to a                        settlement we are unable to impose one on the parties Secretary stressed                        that he did not want to be critical of President Sadat but we do think Sadat is making a mistake in refusing to                        negotiate We feel Sadat had done                        many good things and we want him to be successful We believe if                        negotiations could get started between Egypt and Israel Egypt could get a                        much better solution than it could hope for by any other means King                            Hussein said that in any event he                        thought Jordans case was very strong Secretary noted that when we talk to                        His Majesty about the need for negotiations we are talking to the converted                        since King Hussein has been very                        openminded on this subject Under Secretary Tarr noted that settlement which was accepted by North and                        South Vietnamese would have been viewed by both sides as completely                        unacceptable at outset of negotiations11 King Hussein said he believes                        Jordan must do utmost to achieve a solution but whatever solution is reached                        must be one which will be accepted by people and one which can be beginning                        of real progress and stability Secretary and Deputy Secretary congratulated                        King on his statesmanship and remarked that his example is one which should                        be followed by Egyptians Assistant Secretary Sisco asked if King were to find some glimmer of flexibility                        in the Israeli position how would he feel about the question of which side                        there should be a settlement with first Egypt or Jordan Sisco said we have always thought a Suez                        agreement might be helpful to His Majesty in reaching an agreement with                        Israel King Hussein replied that if                        there were a glimmer of hope he would do everything possible to reach an                        agreement with Israel King said it of no importance to him whether Jordan                        is first second or third to sign agreement with Israel as long as                        settlement is acceptable If a Suez agreement would help in creating a good                        atmosphere that would be fine the King said but Jordan thinks Jerusalem                        and West Bank are the main issues Secretary asked if it would be helpful if                        discussions were to start at same time between Jordan and Israel and Egypt                        and Israel The King responded affirmatively FonMinAbu Zaid said it is important                        however that in any such negotiations the parties not be left alone                        Someone should be there to help them reach agreement12 King Hussein asked Secretarys                        evaluation of Soviet intentions with regard to Middle East conflict                        Secretary said we do not think Soviets are trying to stimulate a renewal of                        hostilities Soviets were very embarrassed by their expulsion from Egypt and                        are now trying to recover the lost ground in Syria and Iraq We do not think                        the Soviets will try to promote negotiations at the outset at least but if                        negotiations get started they might change their attitude We believe                        Soviets welcome continuation of ceasefire King Hussein asked whether opening of Suez Canal would not be to                        advantage of USSR Secretary said there                        would be some advantage to Soviets but we feel that advantages to US would be even greater USG has many and broad interests in Middle                        East and we have every reason to want a settlement Only problem we have in                        our relations with Arabs is Israel Otherwise we get along fine with Arabs                        Secretary said much better than Soviets do13 Secretary remarked that Soviets are competing with China in Middle East                        and for this reason they may feel they have to continue to support Arab                        positions Secretary said he thought Soviets might be pleased to have a                        settlement but for reason he had just cited might find it difficult to be                        active in promoting one King Hussein                        said he thought Soviets would want a degree of trouble and chaos in Middle                        East because they profit from it King noted Soviets are putting a lot of                        equipment into Iraq and have delivered large amounts of military hardware                            to Syria They would like to have                        Syria and Iraq together under USSRs                        aegis14 Finance Minister Saad said that with His Majestys permission he wanted                        to say a word about Israeli actions in Jerusalem and on West Bank Finance                        Minister noted he had been Governor of Palestine in Mandate times and he                        knew Israelis well and had learned their language He could understand how                        there could be negotiations between two equal partners but felt that present                        situation was different Israelis are laying claim to all parts of West Bank                        and are setting up settlements everywhere Finance Minister said he would                        like to ask how Israeli withdrawal can be visualized when Israelis have put                        up so many settlements Secretary said problem is difficult one there is no                        doubt about that But the longer the delay in beginning negotiations the                        more difficult it will become Nothing is gained by delaying It may be that                        Egypt and Israel cannot work out an agreement but even if that is case it                        will not hurt to try Should an agreement be reached Secretary said he was                        sure it would help prospects for an agreement between Jordan and Israel                        Secretary pointed out that USG does not                        support Israels action in establishing settlements on West Bank and has                        said so publicly This USG position has not                        stopped Israelis but it may have slowed them down15 Asst Secy Sisco said one of                        reasons USG emphasizes Suez agreement is                        that if such agreement were to be reached it would create added incentive on                        Israel to face up to compromises needed to reach agreement with Jordan                            Sisco said that it is this                        Jordanian side of problem which we have in mind when we say we do not see                        Suez agreement as an end in itself Secretary said this is absolutely right                        If there is agreement between Israel and Egypt USG would be in much better position to be helpful on other                        issues16 At this point Secretary and King Hussein left group for brief private conversation in                        Secretarys office When rest of group was invited to join them Secretary                        said he and His Majesty had discussed Jordans financial situation                        Secretary said he had assured King Hussein we want to do everything we can to help Jordan                        within the limits of our resourcesA February 7                            memorandum from Saunders to                                Scowcroft reported Kissingers statement that the US

million in total aid in 1973 He also suggested that it might be a good                            idea to promise the King an additional 15 million in budget support                            before

and military aid to                            Jordan and reiterated the US intention to request 40 million in grant                            military aid for Jordan in FY 1974 The

very impressed with work and planning that went into it17 Secretary remarked USG is very impressed                        at actions His Majestys Government had taken to eliminate fedayeen threat                        We feel this was very important Nothing has contributed more to stability                        in Jordan Secretary said we have told this to Lebanese have urged them to                        act against fedayeen also and it appears that they are doing so Secretary                        reiterated that USG wants to do everything                        it can to assist Jordan Hussein said                        that Jordan had no choice but to take the action it did against fedayeen He                        stressed that Jordan has no intention of readmitting fedayeen to its                        territory: We will never reopen our country to them Sisco asked how tight a rein Syrians are                        keeping on fedayeen King Hussein                        said Syrians are tightening up and have removed fedayeen from front line                        King stressed that in recent Cairo Defense Council Jordan did not accept                        return of fedayeen and did not agree to put its army under any other                            commandThe Arab Defense Council met in                            Cairo in JanuarySisco asked if there were a                        possibility for resumption of diplomatic relations with Egypt and Syria                        King Hussein replied he thought so                        Foreign Minister Abu Zaid responded                        that on basis of his contacts at Cairo meeting and elsewhere he thought                        prospects are reasonably good18 In closing Secretary reiterated USGs

5,0.5250817140508361,1182 Subject: Meir Visit:                        IsraelJordan Settlement1 Summary: Israelis are convinced that Hussein now wants peace but in five years since SixDay War                        their asking price for that settlement has grown Israelis have always                        wanted to make West Bank part of Israel if they could but have seen need to                        sacrifice dream to make reality of secure Israel What has been happening in                        recent years is that gradually dream has begun to seem more realistic                        Israelis now feel they can in long run get recognition of all Jerusalem as                        sovereign Israel cession to Israel of onethird West Bank and open borders                        allowing free trade travel and settlement: conditions which at this point                        are impossible for Hussein Result is                        impasse which is at least quiet and from Embassys perspective is not                        intolerable There is also possibility that a prior canal settlement might                        by protecting Israeli rear incline Israelis to be more forthcoming with                            Hussein So if interim                        settlement is real option in coming months it is worthwhile delaying any                        attempts to get JordanIsrael negotiations going But time only increases                        Israeli comfort and investment in territories and further devalues Husseins hand for negotiations Thus if                        canal settlement cannot be had for another two or three years and it is                        determined interests of US strongly involved in return of West Bank to                        Jordan then this Embassy believes negotiations between Israel and Jordan                        can be delayed only at great risk End summary2 Possibility of settlement between Israel and Jordan is exasperatingly                        complex There is no doubt in Israeli minds that Hussein wants peace and that peace between Israel and Jordan                        would be advantageous to Israel Both parties in past have shown they have                        no real hangups about getting together when it is advantageous to do so Yet                        parties positions on issues between them seem almost irreconcilable and                        just as far apart as they were five years ago3 Since 1967 with Israel in occupation of Arab land changes have                        constantly been taking place on the ground and in Israeli psyche which serve                        to raise price of settlement on part of Israel It is paradoxical that this                        point continues and probably will continue to delay a settlement on the very                        front where settlement would be made easiest by desire of both parties for                        peace4 Prior to 1967 Israelis say they would have settled with Jordan on basis                        of divided Jerusalem This would not have been a prior or desired settlement                        from Israeli point of view but would have been endured because of greater                        good to be gained in a peace settlement Once Arab part of city was                        redeemed in SixDay War however mystique of Jerusalem as source of                        Jewish state was seen as more vital to Israel than any possibly transitory                        peace Thus when incorporation of entire city was possible in 1967 this                        was done with hardly a second thought and it will not be undone while                        Israelis have power to prevent it5 In first flush of victory in 1967 when Israelis had surprised even                        themselves by their success and never again wanted to go through period like                        AprilMay 1967 all they felt was needed for Israels security was minor                        border rectifications and two narrow pincers along Jordan River open at                        Jericho When Governor Scranton                        talked with Israelis at end of 1968 Eban told him in great confidence that one of these pincers                        could be dispensed withSee Foreign                                    Relations 19641968 volume XX ArabIsraeli Dispute                                19671968 Document 346 PriMin Eshkol said publicly that Israels demands                        on West Bank were modest enough to permit return to Jordan under a                        settlement of 85 percent of territory and 90 percent of people And except                        for effective demilitarization there were no requirements that area                        returned had to remain open to Israel Today Allon Plan seen as minimalist position in Israel would                        return only some twothirds of territory and would demand freedom of                        settlement and residence for Israelis6 It is not that Israelis have changed their minds fundamentally about West                        Bank since 1967 What has been going on since 1920s is a continual struggle                        between Jews and Arabs for division of British Mandate less Trans Jordan                        Each side has been trying to get as much as it can of this land which is                        roughly the territory of ancient Israel and Jews have gradually but                        persistently pushed Arabs back7 Attachment of Israelis to West Bank is not new Jericho is more of a                        biblical site than Tel Aviv and Hebron had its Jewish community until the                        massacre of 1929 In Jerusalem holy and historical sites are completely                        intermixed and no dividing line could provide each side with what it wants                        As we see it Israeli Jews have always looked upon West Bank as part of                        historic image and would always have wanted to make it part of Israel if                        they could What has been happening in past five years is that what used to                        look like only a dream which had to be sacrificed to make a reality of a                        secure Israel in its narrower borders has gradually begun to look like a                        realistic possibility8 One change in equation is that Israelis no longer feel themselves to be                        only suitor for peace In Israeli view Hussein sees that social and economic changes on West Bank are building obstacles to                        reunion with Jordan every day and every day that passes will make reunion                        more difficult And he is ready for real peace in usual sense of word not                        some Arabic term for truce while he gets ready for next war In short                        Israelis believe Hussein is ready for                        peace and time works against him A year ago Dayan said: The most important change in Israels relation                        to Arabs one of historic significance is the fact that today the need for                        peace is mutual and not merely an Israeli longing and that the need to                        reach a settlement in the region is today as vital for the neighboring Arab                        states as it is for Israel The conclusion Israelis are inclined to make is                        that in end Arabs will come around on question of territory9 A second factor is that value of Jordanian recognition in Israeli eyes has                        gone down From Husseins point of                        view quick settlement with Israel should enhance his bargaining position                        If he is first Arab to sign a peace treaty with Israel and thus give                        Israelis recognition and legitimation which they have sought so long this                        ought to gain him more concessions than would otherwise be case Return he                        seeks is settlement that would enable him to portray himself to his own                        people and to Arab world as leader who had gotten his territory and holy                        city back from Israelis10 From Israels point of view however factors that Hussein thinks should get him a better deal                        are not worth all that much Israel wants peace to be sure but many                        Israelis see current situation on West Bank as closer to kind of peace they                        want than would be any settlement which Hussein is likely to accept Israel has also wanted                        recognition and legitimation particularly from Arabs but its psychological                        need for this has gone down as its relative strength and selfconfidence                        have gone up Husseins isolation in                        Arab world has made recognition by him less valuable than it would have been                        when he was closely associated with Nasser and other leaders So those things that look to                            Hussein like trump cards are                        accorded less importance by the Israelis11 A third factor in Israeli feeling that their demands are feasible is what                        Israelis consider reduced chances for outside particularly US pressure                        It should be remembered that in April 1968 Dayan said that from military and economic points of view                        Israel could maintain status quo indefinitely but it seems to me that the                        key is in the hands of the US that is to say if the US is prepared that                        we should stick to this policy of ours ie as long as there is no peace                        we maintain the status quo we can do it Today with what Israelis                        consider to be deSovietization in large degree of Middle East conflict and                        USSoviet rapprochement they think that US fears of global                        confrontation no longer will lead to US pressure Also US has been                        doing nicely in Arab world and has no need to sacrifice Israel for position                        in Arab world Israelis no longer see                        US selfinterest so intensively engaged in Middle East conflict and                        outside pressure is no longer a credible threat12 For good measure Israelis believe that coexistence they have worked out                        with West Bank takes heat out of situation As Dayan said last year: The more layers we can add to build                        up a normalization of the situation the less pressure there will be on us                        to solve the matter even when the solution is not to our liking Israelis                        convinced status quo on West Bank can go on for years without risk of                        significant violence and consequently without constituting threat to any                        outside power13 With increased Jordanian interest in peace devaluation of what Hussein can offer Israelis in return for                        territory and confidence that outside pressure is not in cards Israelis                        are coming to conclusion that they can hold out for and get whatever they                        want on West Bank Only major limitation most see is need to avoid absorbing                        large Arab population Based on its desires and limited only be demographic                        factor these then are Israels conditions as of now for a settlement with                        Jordan: recognition of all Jerusalem as soverign Israel but with religious                        control of the Moslem holy places under Jordanian authority cession to                        Israel of about onethird of the West Bank including bank of the Jordan                        River except for a small opening in Jericho area open borders allowing free                        travel back and forth trade and probably settlement and residence They                        have only to be stated for it to be seen how far short they fall of being                        advantageous to Hussein14 Where does this leave the US on occasion of Mrs Meirs visit In the view of Embassy while                        situation is far from ideal from our point of view it is also far from                        being intolerable More important it has improved markedly over past two                        years While Israel and Jordan have not made peace they are also not on the                        point of war For present Jordan does not claim a credible military option                        for regaining West Bank and East Jerusalem and this is not likely in                        foreseeable future In terms of shortterm trilateral relations therefore                        we see no grounds for being overly concerned or any need for massive                        investment of American energy or initiative in bringing about a change in                        the situation15 Also there may be positive fallout on Jordanian front if a prior canal                        settlement can be obtained Israelis would worry about any settlement with                        Jordan that resulted in a withdrawal of Israeli forces or in any way                        weakened their position on Jordan River as long as the other Arabs but                        especially Egypt remain committed even theoretically to war to regain the                        territories Israel does not have such confidence in Husseins staying power as to be willing to                        risk any of its security on him16 On other hand if a settlement even an interim settlement on the Suez                        Canal is reached with Egypt that might in Israeli eyes make it possible to be more forthcoming with                        Jordan even though their terms would still fall far short of what Hussein would minimally need to justify the                        settlement for himself Israel therefore believes that a settlement with                        Jordan would be more realistic after an agreement of some kind with Egypt                        To some extent however this is rationalization rather than reason because                        Israelis also are getting more and more comfortable in their position on                        West Bank and feel under little pressure if any to work for a solution                        with Jordan17 Process on West Bank and in Gaza of integration into economy and social                        structure of Israel is proceeding at such a rate that it will within a few                        years foreclose possibility of kind of solution that has been under                        consideration up to now If Jordan has any hope of getting back a major part                        of West Bank or a role in Jerusalem that hope is on wane Most likely                        outcome in our view is that Israel will become more and more the                        determinant as to future of the West Bank and Gaza and rest of world                        including Jordan will have less and less to say about it Strictly from                        point of view of our relations with Israel which is limited responsibility                        of this Embassy we see no great threat to American interests in that                        prospect Case against this must be made by those responsible for a wider                        view of our relations with Arab world and for our overall strategic                        position18 If it is believed that working out of present trends as we see them will                        seriously disadvantage United States then time is not on our side Cards                        which Hussein has are real ones even                        if Israelis do not regard them highly If we wait too long for a prior                        agreement with Egypt to take place effect of facts created by Israel on                        West Bank and in Gaza may outweigh advantage of prior agreement with Egypt                        If there is a prospect that real progress may be made on interim sttlement                        in say next two or three months and especially if action on Jordanian                        front would inhibit that progress then clearly that much of a wait is                        worthwhile If however it should appear that it may be another two or                        three years before agreement can be had on canal and if it is determined                        that interests of US are strongly involved in a return of West Bank or                        large part of it to Jordan then this Embassy believes that negotiations                        between Israel and Jordan could be allowed to wait only at great riskZurhellen,frus1969-76v25d17,"1.

6,0.284922351800603,1182 Subject: Meir Visit:                        IsraelJordan Settlement1 Summary: Israelis are convinced that Hussein now wants peace but in five years since SixDay War                        their asking price for that settlement has grown Israelis have always                        wanted to make West Bank part of Israel if they could but have seen need to                        sacrifice dream to make reality of secure Israel What has been happening in                        recent years is that gradually dream has begun to seem more realistic                        Israelis now feel they can in long run get recognition of all Jerusalem as                        sovereign Israel cession to Israel of onethird West Bank and open borders                        allowing free trade travel and settlement: conditions which at this point                        are impossible for Hussein Result is                        impasse which is at least quiet and from Embassys perspective is not                        intolerable There is also possibility that a prior canal settlement might                        by protecting Israeli rear incline Israelis to be more forthcoming with                            Hussein So if interim                        settlement is real option in coming months it is worthwhile delaying any                        attempts to get JordanIsrael negotiations going But time only increases                        Israeli comfort and investment in territories and further devalues Husseins hand for negotiations Thus if                        canal settlement cannot be had for another two or three years and it is                        determined interests of US strongly involved in return of West Bank to                        Jordan then this Embassy believes negotiations between Israel and Jordan                        can be delayed only at great risk End summary2 Possibility of settlement between Israel and Jordan is exasperatingly                        complex There is no doubt in Israeli minds that Hussein wants peace and that peace between Israel and Jordan                        would be advantageous to Israel Both parties in past have shown they have                        no real hangups about getting together when it is advantageous to do so Yet                        parties positions on issues between them seem almost irreconcilable and                        just as far apart as they were five years ago3 Since 1967 with Israel in occupation of Arab land changes have                        constantly been taking place on the ground and in Israeli psyche which serve                        to raise price of settlement on part of Israel It is paradoxical that this                        point continues and probably will continue to delay a settlement on the very                        front where settlement would be made easiest by desire of both parties for                        peace4 Prior to 1967 Israelis say they would have settled with Jordan on basis                        of divided Jerusalem This would not have been a prior or desired settlement                        from Israeli point of view but would have been endured because of greater                        good to be gained in a peace settlement Once Arab part of city was                        redeemed in SixDay War however mystique of Jerusalem as source of                        Jewish state was seen as more vital to Israel than any possibly transitory                        peace Thus when incorporation of entire city was possible in 1967 this                        was done with hardly a second thought and it will not be undone while                        Israelis have power to prevent it5 In first flush of victory in 1967 when Israelis had surprised even                        themselves by their success and never again wanted to go through period like                        AprilMay 1967 all they felt was needed for Israels security was minor                        border rectifications and two narrow pincers along Jordan River open at                        Jericho When Governor Scranton                        talked with Israelis at end of 1968 Eban told him in great confidence that one of these pincers                        could be dispensed withSee Foreign                                    Relations 19641968 volume XX ArabIsraeli Dispute                                19671968 Document 346 PriMin Eshkol said publicly that Israels demands                        on West Bank were modest enough to permit return to Jordan under a                        settlement of 85 percent of territory and 90 percent of people And except                        for effective demilitarization there were no requirements that area                        returned had to remain open to Israel Today Allon Plan seen as minimalist position in Israel would                        return only some twothirds of territory and would demand freedom of                        settlement and residence for Israelis6 It is not that Israelis have changed their minds fundamentally about West                        Bank since 1967 What has been going on since 1920s is a continual struggle                        between Jews and Arabs for division of British Mandate less Trans Jordan                        Each side has been trying to get as much as it can of this land which is                        roughly the territory of ancient Israel and Jews have gradually but                        persistently pushed Arabs back7 Attachment of Israelis to West Bank is not new Jericho is more of a                        biblical site than Tel Aviv and Hebron had its Jewish community until the                        massacre of 1929 In Jerusalem holy and historical sites are completely                        intermixed and no dividing line could provide each side with what it wants                        As we see it Israeli Jews have always looked upon West Bank as part of                        historic image and would always have wanted to make it part of Israel if                        they could What has been happening in past five years is that what used to                        look like only a dream which had to be sacrificed to make a reality of a                        secure Israel in its narrower borders has gradually begun to look like a                        realistic possibility8 One change in equation is that Israelis no longer feel themselves to be                        only suitor for peace In Israeli view Hussein sees that social and economic changes on West Bank are building obstacles to                        reunion with Jordan every day and every day that passes will make reunion                        more difficult And he is ready for real peace in usual sense of word not                        some Arabic term for truce while he gets ready for next war In short                        Israelis believe Hussein is ready for                        peace and time works against him A year ago Dayan said: The most important change in Israels relation                        to Arabs one of historic significance is the fact that today the need for                        peace is mutual and not merely an Israeli longing and that the need to                        reach a settlement in the region is today as vital for the neighboring Arab                        states as it is for Israel The conclusion Israelis are inclined to make is                        that in end Arabs will come around on question of territory9 A second factor is that value of Jordanian recognition in Israeli eyes has                        gone down From Husseins point of                        view quick settlement with Israel should enhance his bargaining position                        If he is first Arab to sign a peace treaty with Israel and thus give                        Israelis recognition and legitimation which they have sought so long this                        ought to gain him more concessions than would otherwise be case Return he                        seeks is settlement that would enable him to portray himself to his own                        people and to Arab world as leader who had gotten his territory and holy                        city back from Israelis10 From Israels point of view however factors that Hussein thinks should get him a better deal                        are not worth all that much Israel wants peace to be sure but many                        Israelis see current situation on West Bank as closer to kind of peace they                        want than would be any settlement which Hussein is likely to accept Israel has also wanted                        recognition and legitimation particularly from Arabs but its psychological                        need for this has gone down as its relative strength and selfconfidence                        have gone up Husseins isolation in                        Arab world has made recognition by him less valuable than it would have been                        when he was closely associated with Nasser and other leaders So those things that look to                            Hussein like trump cards are                        accorded less importance by the Israelis11 A third factor in Israeli feeling that their demands are feasible is what                        Israelis consider reduced chances for outside particularly US pressure                        It should be remembered that in April 1968 Dayan said that from military and economic points of view                        Israel could maintain status quo indefinitely but it seems to me that the                        key is in the hands of the US that is to say if the US is prepared that                        we should stick to this policy of ours ie as long as there is no peace                        we maintain the status quo we can do it Today with what Israelis                        consider to be deSovietization in large degree of Middle East conflict and                        USSoviet rapprochement they think that US fears of global                        confrontation no longer will lead to US pressure Also US has been                        doing nicely in Arab world and has no need to sacrifice Israel for position                        in Arab world Israelis no longer see                        US selfinterest so intensively engaged in Middle East conflict and                        outside pressure is no longer a credible threat12 For good measure Israelis believe that coexistence they have worked out                        with West Bank takes heat out of situation As Dayan said last year: The more layers we can add to build                        up a normalization of the situation the less pressure there will be on us                        to solve the matter even when the solution is not to our liking Israelis                        convinced status quo on West Bank can go on for years without risk of                        significant violence and consequently without constituting threat to any                        outside power13 With increased Jordanian interest in peace devaluation of what Hussein can offer Israelis in return for                        territory and confidence that outside pressure is not in cards Israelis                        are coming to conclusion that they can hold out for and get whatever they                        want on West Bank Only major limitation most see is need to avoid absorbing                        large Arab population Based on its desires and limited only be demographic                        factor these then are Israels conditions as of now for a settlement with                        Jordan: recognition of all Jerusalem as soverign Israel but with religious                        control of the Moslem holy places under Jordanian authority cession to                        Israel of about onethird of the West Bank including bank of the Jordan                        River except for a small opening in Jericho area open borders allowing free                        travel back and forth trade and probably settlement and residence They                        have only to be stated for it to be seen how far short they fall of being                        advantageous to Hussein14 Where does this leave the US on occasion of Mrs Meirs visit In the view of Embassy while                        situation is far from ideal from our point of view it is also far from                        being intolerable More important it has improved markedly over past two                        years While Israel and Jordan have not made peace they are also not on the                        point of war For present Jordan does not claim a credible military option                        for regaining West Bank and East Jerusalem and this is not likely in                        foreseeable future In terms of shortterm trilateral relations therefore                        we see no grounds for being overly concerned or any need for massive                        investment of American energy or initiative in bringing about a change in                        the situation15 Also there may be positive fallout on Jordanian front if a prior canal                        settlement can be obtained Israelis would worry about any settlement with                        Jordan that resulted in a withdrawal of Israeli forces or in any way                        weakened their position on Jordan River as long as the other Arabs but                        especially Egypt remain committed even theoretically to war to regain the                        territories Israel does not have such confidence in Husseins staying power as to be willing to                        risk any of its security on him16 On other hand if a settlement even an interim settlement on the Suez                        Canal is reached with Egypt that might in Israeli eyes make it possible to be more forthcoming with                        Jordan even though their terms would still fall far short of what Hussein would minimally need to justify the                        settlement for himself Israel therefore believes that a settlement with                        Jordan would be more realistic after an agreement of some kind with Egypt                        To some extent however this is rationalization rather than reason because                        Israelis also are getting more and more comfortable in their position on                        West Bank and feel under little pressure if any to work for a solution                        with Jordan17 Process on West Bank and in Gaza of integration into economy and social                        structure of Israel is proceeding at such a rate that it will within a few                        years foreclose possibility of kind of solution that has been under                        consideration up to now If Jordan has any hope of getting back a major part                        of West Bank or a role in Jerusalem that hope is on wane Most likely                        outcome in our view is that Israel will become more and more the                        determinant as to future of the West Bank and Gaza and rest of world                        including Jordan will have less and less to say about it Strictly from                        point of view of our relations with Israel which is limited responsibility                        of this Embassy we see no great threat to American interests in that                        prospect Case against this must be made by those responsible for a wider                        view of our relations with Arab world and for our overall strategic                        position18 If it is believed that working out of present trends as we see them will                        seriously disadvantage United States then time is not on our side Cards                        which Hussein has are real ones even                        if Israelis do not regard them highly If we wait too long for a prior                        agreement with Egypt to take place effect of facts created by Israel on                        West Bank and in Gaza may outweigh advantage of prior agreement with Egypt                        If there is a prospect that real progress may be made on interim sttlement                        in say next two or three months and especially if action on Jordanian                        front would inhibit that progress then clearly that much of a wait is                        worthwhile If however it should appear that it may be another two or                        three years before agreement can be had on canal and if it is determined                        that interests of US are strongly involved in a return of West Bank or                        large part of it to Jordan then this Embassy believes that negotiations                        between Israel and Jordan could be allowed to wait only at great

7,0.2476020354586654,1182 Subject: Meir Visit:                        IsraelJordan Settlement1 Summary: Israelis are convinced that Hussein now wants peace but in five years since SixDay War                        their asking price for that settlement has grown Israelis have always                        wanted to make West Bank part of Israel if they could but have seen need to                        sacrifice dream to make reality of secure Israel What has been happening in                        recent years is that gradually dream has begun to seem more realistic                        Israelis now feel they can in long run get recognition of all Jerusalem as                        sovereign Israel cession to Israel of onethird West Bank and open borders                        allowing free trade travel and settlement: conditions which at this point                        are impossible for Hussein Result is                        impasse which is at least quiet and from Embassys perspective is not                        intolerable There is also possibility that a prior canal settlement might                        by protecting Israeli rear incline Israelis to be more forthcoming with                            Hussein So if interim                        settlement is real option in coming months it is worthwhile delaying any                        attempts to get JordanIsrael negotiations going But time only increases                        Israeli comfort and investment in territories and further devalues Husseins hand for negotiations Thus if                        canal settlement cannot be had for another two or three years and it is                        determined interests of US strongly involved in return of West Bank to                        Jordan then this Embassy believes negotiations between Israel and Jordan                        can be delayed only at great risk End summary2 Possibility of settlement between Israel and Jordan is exasperatingly                        complex There is no doubt in Israeli minds that Hussein wants peace and that peace between Israel and Jordan                        would be advantageous to Israel Both parties in past have shown they have                        no real hangups about getting together when it is advantageous to do so Yet                        parties positions on issues between them seem almost irreconcilable and                        just as far apart as they were five years ago3 Since 1967 with Israel in occupation of Arab land changes have                        constantly been taking place on the ground and in Israeli psyche which serve                        to raise price of settlement on part of Israel It is paradoxical that this                        point continues and probably will continue to delay a settlement on the very                        front where settlement would be made easiest by desire of both parties for                        peace4 Prior to 1967 Israelis say they would have settled with Jordan on basis                        of divided Jerusalem This would not have been a prior or desired settlement                        from Israeli point of view but would have been endured because of greater                        good to be gained in a peace settlement Once Arab part of city was                        redeemed in SixDay War however mystique of Jerusalem as source of                        Jewish state was seen as more vital to Israel than any possibly transitory                        peace Thus when incorporation of entire city was possible in 1967 this                        was done with hardly a second thought and it will not be undone while                        Israelis have power to prevent it5 In first flush of victory in 1967 when Israelis had surprised even                        themselves by their success and never again wanted to go through period like                        AprilMay 1967 all they felt was needed for Israels security was minor                        border rectifications and two narrow pincers along Jordan River open at                        Jericho When Governor Scranton                        talked with Israelis at end of 1968 Eban told him in great confidence that one of these pincers                        could be dispensed withSee Foreign                                    Relations 19641968 volume XX ArabIsraeli Dispute                                19671968 Document 346 PriMin Eshkol said publicly that Israels demands                        on West Bank were modest enough to permit return to Jordan under a                        settlement of 85 percent of territory and 90 percent of people And except                        for effective demilitarization there were no requirements that area                        returned had to remain open to Israel Today Allon Plan seen as minimalist position in Israel would                        return only some twothirds of territory and would demand freedom of                        settlement and residence for Israelis6 It is not that Israelis have changed their minds fundamentally about West                        Bank since 1967 What has been going on since 1920s is a continual struggle                        between Jews and Arabs for division of British Mandate less Trans Jordan                        Each side has been trying to get as much as it can of this land which is                        roughly the territory of ancient Israel and Jews have gradually but                        persistently pushed Arabs back7 Attachment of Israelis to West Bank is not new Jericho is more of a                        biblical site than Tel Aviv and Hebron had its Jewish community until the                        massacre of 1929 In Jerusalem holy and historical sites are completely                        intermixed and no dividing line could provide each side with what it wants                        As we see it Israeli Jews have always looked upon West Bank as part of                        historic image and would always have wanted to make it part of Israel if                        they could What has been happening in past five years is that what used to                        look like only a dream which had to be sacrificed to make a reality of a                        secure Israel in its narrower borders has gradually begun to look like a                        realistic possibility8 One change in equation is that Israelis no longer feel themselves to be                        only suitor for peace In Israeli view Hussein sees that social and economic changes on West Bank are building obstacles to                        reunion with Jordan every day and every day that passes will make reunion                        more difficult And he is ready for real peace in usual sense of word not                        some Arabic term for truce while he gets ready for next war In short                        Israelis believe Hussein is ready for                        peace and time works against him A year ago Dayan said: The most important change in Israels relation                        to Arabs one of historic significance is the fact that today the need for                        peace is mutual and not merely an Israeli longing and that the need to                        reach a settlement in the region is today as vital for the neighboring Arab                        states as it is for Israel The conclusion Israelis are inclined to make is                        that in end Arabs will come around on question of territory9 A second factor is that value of Jordanian recognition in Israeli eyes has                        gone down From Husseins point of                        view quick settlement with Israel should enhance his bargaining position                        If he is first Arab to sign a peace treaty with Israel and thus give                        Israelis recognition and legitimation which they have sought so long this                        ought to gain him more concessions than would otherwise be case Return he                        seeks is settlement that would enable him to portray himself to his own                        people and to Arab world as leader who had gotten his territory and holy                        city back from Israelis10 From Israels point of view however factors that Hussein thinks should get him a better deal                        are not worth all that much Israel wants peace to be sure but many                        Israelis see current situation on West Bank as closer to kind of peace they                        want than would be any settlement which Hussein is likely to accept Israel has also wanted                        recognition and legitimation particularly from Arabs but its psychological                        need for this has gone down as its relative strength and selfconfidence                        have gone up Husseins isolation in                        Arab world has made recognition by him less valuable than it would have been                        when he was closely associated with Nasser and other leaders So those things that look to                            Hussein like trump cards are                        accorded less importance by the Israelis11 A third factor in Israeli feeling that their demands are feasible is what                        Israelis consider reduced chances for outside particularly US pressure                        It should be remembered that in April 1968 Dayan said that from military and economic points of view                        Israel could maintain status quo indefinitely but it seems to me that the                        key is in the hands of the US that is to say if the US is prepared that                        we should stick to this policy of ours ie as long as there is no peace                        we maintain the status quo we can do it Today with what Israelis                        consider to be deSovietization in large degree of Middle East conflict and                        USSoviet rapprochement they think that US fears of global                        confrontation no longer will lead to US pressure Also US has been                        doing nicely in Arab world and has no need to sacrifice Israel for position                        in Arab world Israelis no longer see                        US selfinterest so intensively engaged in Middle East conflict and                        outside pressure is no longer a credible threat12 For good measure Israelis believe that coexistence they have worked out                        with West Bank takes heat out of situation As Dayan said last year: The more layers we can add to build                        up a normalization of the situation the less pressure there will be on us                        to solve the matter even when the solution is not to our liking Israelis                        convinced status quo on West Bank can go on for years without risk of                        significant violence and consequently without constituting threat to any                        outside power13 With increased Jordanian interest in peace devaluation of what Hussein can offer Israelis in return for                        territory and confidence that outside pressure is not in cards Israelis                        are coming to conclusion that they can hold out for and get whatever they                        want on West Bank Only major limitation most see is need to avoid absorbing                        large Arab population Based on its desires and limited only be demographic                        factor these then are Israels conditions as of now for a settlement with                        Jordan: recognition of all Jerusalem as soverign Israel but with religious                        control of the Moslem holy places under Jordanian authority cession to                        Israel of about onethird of the West Bank including bank of the Jordan                        River except for a small opening in Jericho area open borders allowing free                        travel back and forth trade and probably settlement and residence They                        have only to be stated for it to be seen how far short they fall of being                        advantageous to Hussein14 Where does this leave the US on occasion of Mrs Meirs visit In the view of Embassy while                        situation is far from ideal from our point of view it is also far from                        being intolerable More important it has improved markedly over past two                        years While Israel and Jordan have not made peace they are also not on the                        point of war For present Jordan does not claim a credible military option                        for regaining West Bank and East Jerusalem and this is not likely in                        foreseeable future In terms of shortterm trilateral relations therefore                        we see no grounds for being overly concerned or any need for massive                        investment of American energy or initiative in bringing about a change in                        the situation15 Also there may be positive fallout on Jordanian front if a prior canal                        settlement can be obtained Israelis would worry about any settlement with                        Jordan that resulted in a withdrawal of Israeli forces or in any way                        weakened their position on Jordan River as long as the other Arabs but                        especially Egypt remain committed even theoretically to war to regain the                        territories Israel does not have such confidence in Husseins staying power as to be willing to                        risk any of its security on him16 On other hand if a settlement even an interim settlement on the Suez                        Canal is reached with Egypt that might in Israeli eyes make it possible to be more forthcoming with                        Jordan even though their terms would still fall far short of what Hussein would minimally need to justify the                        settlement for himself Israel therefore believes that a settlement with                        Jordan would be more realistic after an agreement of some kind with Egypt                        To some extent however this is rationalization rather than reason because                        Israelis also are getting more and more comfortable in their position on                        West Bank and feel under little pressure if any to work for a solution                        with Jordan17 Process on West Bank and in Gaza of integration into economy and social                        structure of Israel is proceeding at such a rate that it will within a few                        years foreclose possibility of kind of solution that has been under                        consideration up to now If Jordan has any hope of getting back a major part                        of West Bank or a role in Jerusalem that hope is on wane Most likely                        outcome in our view is that Israel will become more and more the                        determinant as to future of the West Bank and Gaza and rest of world                        including Jordan will have less and less to say about it Strictly from                        point of view of our relations with Israel which is limited responsibility                        of this Embassy we see no great threat to American interests in that                        prospect Case against this must be made by those responsible for a wider                        view of our relations with Arab world and for our overall strategic                        position18 If it is believed that working out of present trends as we see them will                        seriously disadvantage United States then time is not on our side Cards                        which Hussein has are real ones even                        if Israelis do not regard them highly If we wait too long for a prior                        agreement with Egypt to take place effect of facts created by Israel on                        West Bank and in Gaza may outweigh advantage of prior agreement with Egypt                        If there is a prospect that real progress may be made on interim sttlement                        in say next two or three months and especially if action on Jordanian                        front would inhibit that progress then clearly that much of a wait is                        worthwhile If however it should appear that it may be another two or                        three years before agreement can be had on canal and if it is determined                        that interests of US are strongly involved in a return of West Bank or                        large part of it to Jordan then this Embassy believes that negotiations                        between Israel and Jordan could be allowed to wait only at great

8,0.2125845628934747,1182 Subject: Meir Visit:                        IsraelJordan Settlement1 Summary: Israelis are convinced that Hussein now wants peace but in five years since SixDay War                        their asking price for that settlement has grown Israelis have always                        wanted to make West Bank part of Israel if they could but have seen need to                        sacrifice dream to make reality of secure Israel What has been happening in                        recent years is that gradually dream has begun to seem more realistic                        Israelis now feel they can in long run get recognition of all Jerusalem as                        sovereign Israel cession to Israel of onethird West Bank and open borders                        allowing free trade travel and settlement: conditions which at this point                        are impossible for Hussein Result is                        impasse which is at least quiet and from Embassys perspective is not                        intolerable There is also possibility that a prior canal settlement might                        by protecting Israeli rear incline Israelis to be more forthcoming with                            Hussein So if interim                        settlement is real option in coming months it is worthwhile delaying any                        attempts to get JordanIsrael negotiations going But time only increases                        Israeli comfort and investment in territories and further devalues Husseins hand for negotiations Thus if                        canal settlement cannot be had for another two or three years and it is                        determined interests of US strongly involved in return of West Bank to                        Jordan then this Embassy believes negotiations between Israel and Jordan                        can be delayed only at great risk End summary2 Possibility of settlement between Israel and Jordan is exasperatingly                        complex There is no doubt in Israeli minds that Hussein wants peace and that peace between Israel and Jordan                        would be advantageous to Israel Both parties in past have shown they have                        no real hangups about getting together when it is advantageous to do so Yet                        parties positions on issues between them seem almost irreconcilable and                        just as far apart as they were five years ago3 Since 1967 with Israel in occupation of Arab land changes have                        constantly been taking place on the ground and in Israeli psyche which serve                        to raise price of settlement on part of Israel It is paradoxical that this                        point continues and probably will continue to delay a settlement on the very                        front where settlement would be made easiest by desire of both parties for                        peace4 Prior to 1967 Israelis say they would have settled with Jordan on basis                        of divided Jerusalem This would not have been a prior or desired settlement                        from Israeli point of view but would have been endured because of greater                        good to be gained in a peace settlement Once Arab part of city was                        redeemed in SixDay War however mystique of Jerusalem as source of                        Jewish state was seen as more vital to Israel than any possibly transitory                        peace Thus when incorporation of entire city was possible in 1967 this                        was done with hardly a second thought and it will not be undone while                        Israelis have power to prevent it5 In first flush of victory in 1967 when Israelis had surprised even                        themselves by their success and never again wanted to go through period like                        AprilMay 1967 all they felt was needed for Israels security was minor                        border rectifications and two narrow pincers along Jordan River open at                        Jericho When Governor Scranton                        talked with Israelis at end of 1968 Eban told him in great confidence that one of these pincers                        could be dispensed withSee Foreign                                    Relations 19641968 volume XX ArabIsraeli Dispute                                19671968 Document 346 PriMin Eshkol said publicly that Israels demands                        on West Bank were modest enough to permit return to Jordan under a                        settlement of 85 percent of territory and 90 percent of people And except                        for effective demilitarization there were no requirements that area                        returned had to remain open to Israel Today Allon Plan seen as minimalist position in Israel would                        return only some twothirds of territory and would demand freedom of                        settlement and residence for Israelis6 It is not that Israelis have changed their minds fundamentally about West                        Bank since 1967 What has been going on since 1920s is a continual struggle                        between Jews and Arabs for division of British Mandate less Trans Jordan                        Each side has been trying to get as much as it can of this land which is                        roughly the territory of ancient Israel and Jews have gradually but                        persistently pushed Arabs back7 Attachment of Israelis to West Bank is not new Jericho is more of a                        biblical site than Tel Aviv and Hebron had its Jewish community until the                        massacre of 1929 In Jerusalem holy and historical sites are completely                        intermixed and no dividing line could provide each side with what it wants                        As we see it Israeli Jews have always looked upon West Bank as part of                        historic image and would always have wanted to make it part of Israel if                        they could What has been happening in past five years is that what used to                        look like only a dream which had to be sacrificed to make a reality of a                        secure Israel in its narrower borders has gradually begun to look like a                        realistic possibility8 One change in equation is that Israelis no longer feel themselves to be                        only suitor for peace In Israeli view Hussein sees that social and economic changes on West Bank are building obstacles to                        reunion with Jordan every day and every day that passes will make reunion                        more difficult And he is ready for real peace in usual sense of word not                        some Arabic term for truce while he gets ready for next war In short                        Israelis believe Hussein is ready for                        peace and time works against him A year ago Dayan said: The most important change in Israels relation                        to Arabs one of historic significance is the fact that today the need for                        peace is mutual and not merely an Israeli longing and that the need to                        reach a settlement in the region is today as vital for the neighboring Arab                        states as it is for Israel The conclusion Israelis are inclined to make is                        that in end Arabs will come around on question of territory9 A second factor is that value of Jordanian recognition in Israeli eyes has                        gone down From Husseins point of                        view quick settlement with Israel should enhance his bargaining position                        If he is first Arab to sign a peace treaty with Israel and thus give                        Israelis recognition and legitimation which they have sought so long this                        ought to gain him more concessions than would otherwise be case Return he                        seeks is settlement that would enable him to portray himself to his own                        people and to Arab world as leader who had gotten his territory and holy                        city back from Israelis10 From Israels point of view however factors that Hussein thinks should get him a better deal                        are not worth all that much Israel wants peace to be sure but many                        Israelis see current situation on West Bank as closer to kind of peace they                        want than would be any settlement which Hussein is likely to accept Israel has also wanted                        recognition and legitimation particularly from Arabs but its psychological                        need for this has gone down as its relative strength and selfconfidence                        have gone up Husseins isolation in                        Arab world has made recognition by him less valuable than it would have been                        when he was closely associated with Nasser and other leaders So those things that look to                            Hussein like trump cards are                        accorded less importance by the Israelis11 A third factor in Israeli feeling that their demands are feasible is what                        Israelis consider reduced chances for outside particularly US pressure                        It should be remembered that in April 1968 Dayan said that from military and economic points of view                        Israel could maintain status quo indefinitely but it seems to me that the                        key is in the hands of the US that is to say if the US is prepared that                        we should stick to this policy of ours ie as long as there is no peace                        we maintain the status quo we can do it Today with what Israelis                        consider to be deSovietization in large degree of Middle East conflict and                        USSoviet rapprochement they think that US fears of global                        confrontation no longer will lead to US pressure Also US has been                        doing nicely in Arab world and has no need to sacrifice Israel for position                        in Arab world Israelis no longer see                        US selfinterest so intensively engaged in Middle East conflict and                        outside pressure is no longer a credible threat12 For good measure Israelis believe that coexistence they have worked out                        with West Bank takes heat out of situation As Dayan said last year: The more layers we can add to build                        up a normalization of the situation the less pressure there will be on us                        to solve the matter even when the solution is not to our liking Israelis                        convinced status quo on West Bank can go on for years without risk of                        significant violence and consequently without constituting threat to any                        outside power13 With increased Jordanian interest in peace devaluation of what Hussein can offer Israelis in return for                        territory and confidence that outside pressure is not in cards Israelis                        are coming to conclusion that they can hold out for and get whatever they                        want on West Bank Only major limitation most see is need to avoid absorbing                        large Arab population Based on its desires and limited only be demographic                        factor these then are Israels conditions as of now for a settlement with                        Jordan: recognition of all Jerusalem as soverign Israel but with religious                        control of the Moslem holy places under Jordanian authority cession to                        Israel of about onethird of the West Bank including bank of the Jordan                        River except for a small opening in Jericho area open borders allowing free                        travel back and forth trade and probably settlement and residence They                        have only to be stated for it to be seen how far short they fall of being                        advantageous to Hussein14 Where does this leave the US on occasion of Mrs Meirs visit In the view of Embassy while                        situation is far from ideal from our point of view it is also far from                        being intolerable More important it has improved markedly over past two                        years While Israel and Jordan have not made peace they are also not on the                        point of war For present Jordan does not claim a credible military option                        for regaining West Bank and East Jerusalem and this is not likely in                        foreseeable future In terms of shortterm trilateral relations therefore                        we see no grounds for being overly concerned or any need for massive                        investment of American energy or initiative in bringing about a change in                        the situation15 Also there may be positive fallout on Jordanian front if a prior canal                        settlement can be obtained Israelis would worry about any settlement with                        Jordan that resulted in a withdrawal of Israeli forces or in any way                        weakened their position on Jordan River as long as the other Arabs but                        especially Egypt remain committed even theoretically to war to regain the                        territories Israel does not have such confidence in Husseins staying power as to be willing to                        risk any of its security on him16 On other hand if a settlement even an interim settlement on the Suez                        Canal is reached with Egypt that might in Israeli eyes make it possible to be more forthcoming with                        Jordan even though their terms would still fall far short of what Hussein would minimally need to justify the                        settlement for himself Israel therefore believes that a settlement with                        Jordan would be more realistic after an agreement of some kind with Egypt                        To some extent however this is rationalization rather than reason because                        Israelis also are getting more and more comfortable in their position on                        West Bank and feel under little pressure if any to work for a solution                        with Jordan17 Process on West Bank and in Gaza of integration into economy and social                        structure of Israel is proceeding at such a rate that it will within a few                        years foreclose possibility of kind of solution that has been under                        consideration up to now If Jordan has any hope of getting back a major part                        of West Bank or a role in Jerusalem that hope is on wane Most likely                        outcome in our view is that Israel will become more and more the                        determinant as to future of the West Bank and Gaza and rest of world                        including Jordan will have less and less to say about it Strictly from                        point of view of our relations with Israel which is limited responsibility                        of this Embassy we see no great threat to American interests in that                        prospect Case against this must be made by those responsible for a wider                        view of our relations with Arab world and for our overall strategic                        position18 If it is believed that working out of present trends as we see them will                        seriously disadvantage United States then time is not on our side Cards                        which Hussein has are real ones even                        if Israelis do not regard them highly If we wait too long for a prior                        agreement with Egypt to take place effect of facts created by Israel on                        West Bank and in Gaza may outweigh advantage of prior agreement with Egypt                        If there is a prospect that real progress may be made on interim sttlement                        in say next two or three months and especially if action on Jordanian                        front would inhibit that progress then clearly that much of a wait is                        worthwhile If however it should appear that it may be another two or                        three years before agreement can be had on canal and if it is determined                        that interests of US are strongly involved in a return of West Bank or                        large part of it to Jordan then this Embassy believes that negotiations                        between Israel and Jordan could be allowed to wait only at great riskZurhellen,frus1969-76v25d17,"1. SUMMARY. AGOSTINHO NETO ASKED JOAQUIM PINTO DE ANDRADE TO PARTICIPATE IN THE TRANSITIONAL GOVERNMENT. ANDRADE AND OTHER MEMBERS OF THE ""REVOLTA ACTIVA"" HAVE REFUSED TO COOPERATE WITH NETO UNLESS HE AGREES TO ACCEPT THEM AS A LEGITIMATE CURRENTO OF OPINION WITHIN THE PARTY. END SUMMARY.\n2. AFTER THE LUSAKA CONGRESS OF THE MPLA IN AUGUST OF 1974, NETO HELD AN INTERREGIONAL CONGRESS IN EASTERN ANGOLA IN SEPTEMBER, WHERE HE GATHERED TOGETHER LOYALISTS AND SET UP A NEW CENTRAL COMMITTEE. ASIDE FROM LUCIO LARA, NONE OF THE MEMBERS HAS MUCH REPUTATION OR EXPERIENCE. NO ONE DOUBTS LARS INTELLIGENCE, BUT HE IS SUPPOSED TO BE FLAWED BY A DEEP BITTERNESS AND A TERRIBLE DESIRE FOR REVENGE AGAINST WHITES. LOPO DE NASCIMENTO, THE MPLA MEMBER OF THE PRESIDENTIAL COUNCIL IS THOUGHT OF AS A PLEASANT YOUNG MAN, BUT HE HAS NOT STATURE, NO EXPERIENCE AND LITTLE INCLINATION TO STAND UP TO ANYBODY AT THIS POINT. CONFIDENTIAL ERMINIO ESCORCIO, ANOTHER MEMBER OF NETOS INNER GROUP IS DISMISSED BY SOME WHO KNOW HIM AS AN IMBECILE. NETO REALIZES THAT HS IS IN REAL TROUBLE FOR LACK OF GOOD PEOPLE AND IS TRYING TO INDUCE THE ANDRADE FACTION TO TAKE AN ACTIVE PART IN POLITICS.\n3. AS I HAVE PIECED TOGETHER THE STORY, NETO PASSED THE WORD TO JOAQUIM PINTO DE ANDRADE BEFORE OR DURING THE ALVOR CONFERENCE THAT HE WANTED HIM IN THE TRANSITIONAL GOVERNMENT, PROBABLY AS THE MPLA MEMBER OF THE PRESIDENTIAL COUNCIL, OR COLLEGIUM. ANDRADE SENT BACK WORD THAT HE WOULD ACCEPT ON THE CONDITION THAT THE ""REVOLTA ACTIVA"", OR ANDRADE FACTION, BE LEGITIMATIZED WITHIN THE PARTY AND THAT ITS VIEWS AND OPINIONS HAVE WEIGHT IN PARTY COUNCILS. NETO REFUSED AND WENT AHEAD WITH THE SELECTION OF THE PEOPLE NOW IN THE GOVERNMENT.\n4. A FEW DAYS AFTER HIS ARRIVAL IN LUANDA, NETO GRASPED THAT THINGS WERE NOT GOING WELL FOR MPLA AND HE CALLED SOME OLD FRIENDS AMONG THE REVOLTA ACTIVA AND ASKED TO TALK WITH THEM. THEY ALL REFUSED AND TOLD HIM TO TALK WITH ANDRADE. NETO THEN ARRANGED TO MEET WITH ANDRADE WHO BY THIS TIME HAD RETURNED TO LUANDA. NETO REITERATED HIS REQUEST THAT JOAQUIM PARTICIPATE. ANDRADE AGREED, BUT REITERATED HIS DEMAND THAT THE ENTIRE FACTION AND ITS OPINIONS BE ACCEPTED AND ADDED A FEW OTHERS.\n5. ANDRADE AND NETO AGREED TO NOMINATE DELEGATES TO NEGOTIATE A FORMULA ACCEPTABLE TO BOTH SIDES. THE ANDRADE FACTION HAS THREE PRINCIPAL DEMANDS: 1) EASE OUT LARA AND ESCORCIO; THEY NEED NOT NECESSARILY BE THROWN OUT OF THE PARTY, BUT THEY MUST BE PUT SOMEWHERE WHERE THEY WILL NOT HAVE MAJOR RESPONSIBILITIES;\n6. THE IMPLICATIONS TO MPLA OF THE NEGOTIATIONS ARE GREAT. NETO HAS NOBODY WITH ANY PRESTIGE OR CAPABILITY AND THE PARTY NEEDS THE ANDRADE FACTION IF MPLA IS TO HAVE A CHANCE AGAINST THE WELL ORGANIZED UNITA DRIVE FOR VOTES AND THE GROWING ACCEPTANCE OF FNLA AMONG BOTH BLACKS AND WHITES. THE ANDRADE PEOPLE HAVE NO CONFIDENTIAL INTENTION OF LEAVING THE PARTY APPARATUS IN THE HANDS OF NETO IF THEY CAN HELP IT. THEY HOPE TO BE ABLE TO REMOVE HIM FROM THE CENTER AND RELEGATE HIM TO THE ROLE OF PARTY HERO AND ELDER STATESMAN. I HAVE REAL DOUBTS THAT THE ANDRADE FACTION CAN TAKE AWAY FROM NETO ALL THE LEVERS OF POWER. THEY HAVE NOT SHOWN MUCH STOMACH FOR POLITICAL INFIGHTING, WHILE NETO WILL STOP AT NOTHING TO RETAIN POWER. ANDRADE AND COMPANY DO HAVE A USEFUL WEAPON - DENIAL - NOW THAT NETO SEES HIS PRESENT CADRE IS NOT UP TO THE JOB THAT MUST BE DONE. IT IS A SAD COMMENTARY ON NETOS LEADERSHIP THAT MPLA, WHICH WAS TOUTED AS HAVING THE BEST TALENT AND THE GREATEST DEPTH AMONG THE LIBERATION MOVEMENTS NOT ONLY IS THE WEAKEST GROUP IN THE GOVERNMENT, IT HAS THE REPUTATION OF A GANG OF TOUGHS.

9,0.1672645566213119,1182 Subject: Meir Visit:                        IsraelJordan Settlement1 Summary: Israelis are convinced that Hussein now wants peace but in five years since SixDay War                        their asking price for that settlement has grown Israelis have always                        wanted to make West Bank part of Israel if they could but have seen need to                        sacrifice dream to make reality of secure Israel What has been happening in                        recent years is that gradually dream has begun to seem more realistic                        Israelis now feel they can in long run get recognition of all Jerusalem as                        sovereign Israel cession to Israel of onethird West Bank and open borders                        allowing free trade travel and settlement: conditions which at this point                        are impossible for Hussein Result is                        impasse which is at least quiet and from Embassys perspective is not                        intolerable There is also possibility that a prior canal settlement might                        by protecting Israeli rear incline Israelis to be more forthcoming with                            Hussein So if interim                        settlement is real option in coming months it is worthwhile delaying any                        attempts to get JordanIsrael negotiations going But time only increases                        Israeli comfort and investment in territories and further devalues Husseins hand for negotiations Thus if                        canal settlement cannot be had for another two or three years and it is                        determined interests of US strongly involved in return of West Bank to                        Jordan then this Embassy believes negotiations between Israel and Jordan                        can be delayed only at great risk End summary2 Possibility of settlement between Israel and Jordan is exasperatingly                        complex There is no doubt in Israeli minds that Hussein wants peace and that peace between Israel and Jordan                        would be advantageous to Israel Both parties in past have shown they have                        no real hangups about getting together when it is advantageous to do so Yet                        parties positions on issues between them seem almost irreconcilable and                        just as far apart as they were five years ago3 Since 1967 with Israel in occupation of Arab land changes have                        constantly been taking place on the ground and in Israeli psyche which serve                        to raise price of settlement on part of Israel It is paradoxical that this                        point continues and probably will continue to delay a settlement on the very                        front where settlement would be made easiest by desire of both parties for                        peace4 Prior to 1967 Israelis say they would have settled with Jordan on basis                        of divided Jerusalem This would not have been a prior or desired settlement                        from Israeli point of view but would have been endured because of greater                        good to be gained in a peace settlement Once Arab part of city was                        redeemed in SixDay War however mystique of Jerusalem as source of                        Jewish state was seen as more vital to Israel than any possibly transitory                        peace Thus when incorporation of entire city was possible in 1967 this                        was done with hardly a second thought and it will not be undone while                        Israelis have power to prevent it5 In first flush of victory in 1967 when Israelis had surprised even                        themselves by their success and never again wanted to go through period like                        AprilMay 1967 all they felt was needed for Israels security was minor                        border rectifications and two narrow pincers along Jordan River open at                        Jericho When Governor Scranton                        talked with Israelis at end of 1968 Eban told him in great confidence that one of these pincers                        could be dispensed withSee Foreign                                    Relations 19641968 volume XX ArabIsraeli Dispute                                19671968 Document 346 PriMin Eshkol said publicly that Israels demands                        on West Bank were modest enough to permit return to Jordan under a                        settlement of 85 percent of territory and 90 percent of people And except                        for effective demilitarization there were no requirements that area                        returned had to remain open to Israel Today Allon Plan seen as minimalist position in Israel would                        return only some twothirds of territory and would demand freedom of                        settlement and residence for Israelis6 It is not that Israelis have changed their minds fundamentally about West                        Bank since 1967 What has been going on since 1920s is a continual struggle                        between Jews and Arabs for division of British Mandate less Trans Jordan                        Each side has been trying to get as much as it can of this land which is                        roughly the territory of ancient Israel and Jews have gradually but                        persistently pushed Arabs back7 Attachment of Israelis to West Bank is not new Jericho is more of a                        biblical site than Tel Aviv and Hebron had its Jewish community until the                        massacre of 1929 In Jerusalem holy and historical sites are completely                        intermixed and no dividing line could provide each side with what it wants                        As we see it Israeli Jews have always looked upon West Bank as part of                        historic image and would always have wanted to make it part of Israel if                        they could What has been happening in past five years is that what used to                        look like only a dream which had to be sacrificed to make a reality of a                        secure Israel in its narrower borders has gradually begun to look like a                        realistic possibility8 One change in equation is that Israelis no longer feel themselves to be                        only suitor for peace In Israeli view Hussein sees that social and economic changes on West Bank are building obstacles to                        reunion with Jordan every day and every day that passes will make reunion                        more difficult And he is ready for real peace in usual sense of word not                        some Arabic term for truce while he gets ready for next war In short                        Israelis believe Hussein is ready for                        peace and time works against him A year ago Dayan said: The most important change in Israels relation                        to Arabs one of historic significance is the fact that today the need for                        peace is mutual and not merely an Israeli longing and that the need to                        reach a settlement in the region is today as vital for the neighboring Arab                        states as it is for Israel The conclusion Israelis are inclined to make is                        that in end Arabs will come around on question of territory9 A second factor is that value of Jordanian recognition in Israeli eyes has                        gone down From Husseins point of                        view quick settlement with Israel should enhance his bargaining position                        If he is first Arab to sign a peace treaty with Israel and thus give                        Israelis recognition and legitimation which they have sought so long this                        ought to gain him more concessions than would otherwise be case Return he                        seeks is settlement that would enable him to portray himself to his own                        people and to Arab world as leader who had gotten his territory and holy                        city back from Israelis10 From Israels point of view however factors that Hussein thinks should get him a better deal                        are not worth all that much Israel wants peace to be sure but many                        Israelis see current situation on West Bank as closer to kind of peace they                        want than would be any settlement which Hussein is likely to accept Israel has also wanted                        recognition and legitimation particularly from Arabs but its psychological                        need for this has gone down as its relative strength and selfconfidence                        have gone up Husseins isolation in                        Arab world has made recognition by him less valuable than it would have been                        when he was closely associated with Nasser and other leaders So those things that look to                            Hussein like trump cards are                        accorded less importance by the Israelis11 A third factor in Israeli feeling that their demands are feasible is what                        Israelis consider reduced chances for outside particularly US pressure                        It should be remembered that in April 1968 Dayan said that from military and economic points of view                        Israel could maintain status quo indefinitely but it seems to me that the                        key is in the hands of the US that is to say if the US is prepared that                        we should stick to this policy of ours ie as long as there is no peace                        we maintain the status quo we can do it Today with what Israelis                        consider to be deSovietization in large degree of Middle East conflict and                        USSoviet rapprochement they think that US fears of global                        confrontation no longer will lead to US pressure Also US has been                        doing nicely in Arab world and has no need to sacrifice Israel for position                        in Arab world Israelis no longer see                        US selfinterest so intensively engaged in Middle East conflict and                        outside pressure is no longer a credible threat12 For good measure Israelis believe that coexistence they have worked out                        with West Bank takes heat out of situation As Dayan said last year: The more layers we can add to build                        up a normalization of the situation the less pressure there will be on us                        to solve the matter even when the solution is not to our liking Israelis                        convinced status quo on West Bank can go on for years without risk of                        significant violence and consequently without constituting threat to any                        outside power13 With increased Jordanian interest in peace devaluation of what Hussein can offer Israelis in return for                        territory and confidence that outside pressure is not in cards Israelis                        are coming to conclusion that they can hold out for and get whatever they                        want on West Bank Only major limitation most see is need to avoid absorbing                        large Arab population Based on its desires and limited only be demographic                        factor these then are Israels conditions as of now for a settlement with                        Jordan: recognition of all Jerusalem as soverign Israel but with religious                        control of the Moslem holy places under Jordanian authority cession to                        Israel of about onethird of the West Bank including bank of the Jordan                        River except for a small opening in Jericho area open borders allowing free                        travel back and forth trade and probably settlement and residence They                        have only to be stated for it to be seen how far short they fall of being                        advantageous to Hussein14 Where does this leave the US on occasion of Mrs Meirs visit In the view of Embassy while                        situation is far from ideal from our point of view it is also far from                        being intolerable More important it has improved markedly over past two                        years While Israel and Jordan have not made peace they are also not on the                        point of war For present Jordan does not claim a credible military option                        for regaining West Bank and East Jerusalem and this is not likely in                        foreseeable future In terms of shortterm trilateral relations therefore                        we see no grounds for being overly concerned or any need for massive                        investment of American energy or initiative in bringing about a change in                        the situation15 Also there may be positive fallout on Jordanian front if a prior canal                        settlement can be obtained Israelis would worry about any settlement with                        Jordan that resulted in a withdrawal of Israeli forces or in any way                        weakened their position on Jordan River as long as the other Arabs but                        especially Egypt remain committed even theoretically to war to regain the                        territories Israel does not have such confidence in Husseins staying power as to be willing to                        risk any of its security on him16 On other hand if a settlement even an interim settlement on the Suez                        Canal is reached with Egypt that might in Israeli eyes make it possible to be more forthcoming with                        Jordan even though their terms would still fall far short of what Hussein would minimally need to justify the                        settlement for himself Israel therefore believes that a settlement with                        Jordan would be more realistic after an agreement of some kind with Egypt                        To some extent however this is rationalization rather than reason because                        Israelis also are getting more and more comfortable in their position on                        West Bank and feel under little pressure if any to work for a solution                        with Jordan17 Process on West Bank and in Gaza of integration into economy and social                        structure of Israel is proceeding at such a rate that it will within a few                        years foreclose possibility of kind of solution that has been under                        consideration up to now If Jordan has any hope of getting back a major part                        of West Bank or a role in Jerusalem that hope is on wane Most likely                        outcome in our view is that Israel will become more and more the                        determinant as to future of the West Bank and Gaza and rest of world                        including Jordan will have less and less to say about it Strictly from                        point of view of our relations with Israel which is limited responsibility                        of this Embassy we see no great threat to American interests in that                        prospect Case against this must be made by those responsible for a wider                        view of our relations with Arab world and for our overall strategic                        position18 If it is believed that working out of present trends as we see them will                        seriously disadvantage United States then time is not on our side Cards                        which Hussein has are real ones even                        if Israelis do not regard them highly If we wait too long for a prior                        agreement with Egypt to take place effect of facts created by Israel on                        West Bank and in Gaza may outweigh advantage of prior agreement with Egypt                        If there is a prospect that real progress may be made on interim sttlement                        in say next two or three months and especially if action on Jordanian                        front would inhibit that progress then clearly that much of a wait is                        worthwhile If however it should appear that it may be another two or                        three years before agreement can be had on canal and if it is determined                        that interests of US are strongly involved in a return of West Bank or                        large part of it to Jordan then this Embassy believes that negotiations                        between Israel and Jordan could be allowed to wait only at great

SUMMARY. AGOSTINHO NETO ASKED JOAQUIM PINTO DE ANDRADE TO PARTICIPATE IN THE TRANSITIONAL GOVERNMENT. ANDRADE AND OTHER MEMBERS OF THE ""REVOLTA ACTIVA"" HAVE REFUSED TO COOPERATE WITH NETO UNLESS HE AGREES TO ACCEPT THEM AS A LEGITIMATE CURRENTO OF OPINION WITHIN THE PARTY. END SUMMARY.\n2. AFTER THE LUSAKA CONGRESS OF THE MPLA IN AUGUST OF 1974, NETO HELD AN INTERREGIONAL CONGRESS IN EASTERN ANGOLA IN SEPTEMBER, WHERE HE GATHERED TOGETHER LOYALISTS AND SET UP A NEW CENTRAL COMMITTEE. ASIDE FROM LUCIO LARA, NONE OF THE MEMBERS HAS MUCH REPUTATION OR EXPERIENCE. NO ONE DOUBTS LARS INTELLIGENCE, BUT HE IS SUPPOSED TO BE FLAWED BY A DEEP BITTERNESS AND A TERRIBLE DESIRE FOR REVENGE AGAINST WHITES. LOPO DE NASCIMENTO, THE MPLA MEMBER OF THE PRESIDENTIAL COUNCIL IS THOUGHT OF AS A PLEASANT YOUNG MAN, BUT HE HAS NOT STATURE, NO EXPERIENCE AND LITTLE INCLINATION TO STAND UP TO ANYBODY AT THIS POINT. CONFIDENTIAL ERMINIO ESCORCIO, ANOTHER MEMBER OF NETOS INNER GROUP IS DISMISSED BY SOME WHO KNOW HIM AS AN IMBECILE. NETO REALIZES THAT HS IS IN REAL TROUBLE FOR LACK OF GOOD PEOPLE AND IS TRYING TO INDUCE THE ANDRADE FACTION TO TAKE AN ACTIVE PART IN POLITICS.\n3. AS I HAVE PIECED TOGETHER THE STORY, NETO PASSED THE WORD TO JOAQUIM PINTO DE ANDRADE BEFORE OR DURING THE ALVOR CONFERENCE THAT HE WANTED HIM IN THE TRANSITIONAL GOVERNMENT, PROBABLY AS THE MPLA MEMBER OF THE PRESIDENTIAL COUNCIL, OR COLLEGIUM. ANDRADE SENT BACK WORD THAT HE WOULD ACCEPT ON THE CONDITION THAT THE ""REVOLTA ACTIVA"", OR ANDRADE FACTION, BE LEGITIMATIZED WITHIN THE PARTY AND THAT ITS VIEWS AND OPINIONS HAVE WEIGHT IN PARTY COUNCILS. NETO REFUSED AND WENT AHEAD WITH THE SELECTION OF THE PEOPLE NOW IN THE GOVERNMENT.\n4. A FEW DAYS AFTER HIS ARRIVAL IN LUANDA, NETO GRASPED THAT THINGS WERE NOT GOING WELL FOR MPLA AND HE CALLED SOME OLD FRIENDS AMONG THE REVOLTA ACTIVA AND ASKED TO TALK WITH THEM. THEY ALL REFUSED AND TOLD HIM TO TALK WITH ANDRADE. NETO THEN ARRANGED TO MEET WITH ANDRADE WHO BY THIS TIME HAD RETURNED TO LUANDA. NETO REITERATED HIS REQUEST THAT JOAQUIM PARTICIPATE. ANDRADE AGREED, BUT REITERATED HIS DEMAND THAT THE ENTIRE FACTION AND ITS OPINIONS BE ACCEPTED AND ADDED A FEW OTHERS.\n5. ANDRADE AND NETO AGREED TO NOMINATE DELEGATES TO NEGOTIATE A FORMULA ACCEPTABLE TO BOTH SIDES. THE ANDRADE FACTION HAS THREE PRINCIPAL DEMANDS: 1) EASE OUT LARA AND ESCORCIO; THEY NEED NOT NECESSARILY BE THROWN OUT OF THE PARTY, BUT THEY MUST BE PUT SOMEWHERE WHERE THEY WILL NOT HAVE MAJOR RESPONSIBILITIES;\n6. THE IMPLICATIONS TO MPLA OF THE NEGOTIATIONS ARE GREAT. NETO HAS NOBODY WITH ANY PRESTIGE OR CAPABILITY AND THE PARTY NEEDS THE ANDRADE FACTION IF MPLA IS TO HAVE A CHANCE AGAINST THE WELL ORGANIZED UNITA DRIVE FOR VOTES AND THE GROWING ACCEPTANCE OF FNLA AMONG BOTH BLACKS AND WHITES. THE ANDRADE PEOPLE HAVE NO CONFIDENTIAL INTENTION OF LEAVING THE PARTY APPARATUS IN THE HANDS OF NETO IF THEY CAN HELP IT. THEY HOPE TO BE ABLE TO REMOVE HIM FROM THE CENTER AND RELEGATE HIM TO THE ROLE OF PARTY HERO AND ELDER STATESMAN. I HAVE REAL DOUBTS THAT THE ANDRADE FACTION CAN TAKE AWAY FROM NETO ALL THE LEVERS OF POWER. THEY HAVE NOT SHOWN MUCH STOMACH FOR POLITICAL INFIGHTING, WHILE NETO WILL STOP AT NOTHING TO RETAIN POWER. ANDRADE AND COMPANY DO HAVE A USEFUL WEAPON - DENIAL - NOW THAT NETO SEES HIS PRESENT CADRE IS NOT UP TO THE JOB THAT MUST BE DONE. IT IS A SAD COMMENTARY ON NETOS LEADERSHIP THAT MPLA, WHICH WAS TOUTED AS HAVING THE BEST TALENT AND THE GREATEST DEPTH AMONG THE LIBERATION MOVEMENTS NOT ONLY IS THE WEAKEST GROUP IN THE GOVERNMENT, IT HAS THE REPUTATION OF A GANG OF TOUGHS.

TO SET THE RECORD STRAIGHT ON THIS POINT,  DUVALIER IN CREOLE ADDRESS JANUARY 26  ( HIS ONLY PUBLIC STATEMENT ON KIDNAPPERS)  SAID IF THEY RETURNED TO HAITI HE WOULD "" BE WAITING FOR THEM WITH A BIG COCOMACAQUE"".   A COCOMACAQUE IS A HEAVY STICK SIMILAR TO AN IRISH SHILLELAGH AND USED FOR THE SAME PURPOSES.

FSTMS LEADERS BELIEVE THAT WHILE BANZER MAY BE SHAKY, THERE IS NO CHANCE OF DRIVING THE MILITARY FROM POWER. THE FSTMB BELIEVES CONFIDENTIAL THAT IF BANZER WERE OUSTED, HE WOULD BE REPLACED BY SOME OTHER OFFICER AND THE CHANCES ARE THAT THAT OFFICER WOULD BE ""EVEN WORSE THAN BANZER"" FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF THE WORKING CLASS. THE FSTMB THEREFORE PREFERS TO SIT OUT THE CURRENT WAVE OF TENSIONS AND AVOID GIVING ANYONE AN EXCUSE TO CLOSE DOWN THE FEDERATION.

EMBASSY NOTES THAT MEXICAN FOREIGN SECRETARY RABASA AND AMBASSADOR TO THE U. S.  DE OLLOQUI HAVE BOTH CITED AS ONE REASON FOR NOT EXTRADITING KNOX KIDNAPPERS TO HAITI AN ALLEGED ANNOUNCEMENT BY PRESIDENT DUVALIER THAT HE WOULD LIQUIDATE THE KIDNAPPERS IF HE COULD GET HIS HANDS ON THEM. \n2.   TO SET THE RECORD STRAIGHT ON THIS POINT,  DUVALIER IN CREOLE ADDRESS JANUARY 26  ( HIS ONLY PUBLIC STATEMENT ON KIDNAPPERS)  SAID IF THEY RETURNED TO HAITI HE WOULD "" BE WAITING FOR THEM WITH A BIG COCOMACAQUE"".   A COCOMACAQUE IS A HEAVY STICK SIMILAR TO AN IRISH SHILLELAGH AND USED FOR THE SAME PURPOSES.   THE INFERENCE WAS CLEARLY THAT THE KIDNAPPERS WOULD BE IN FOR ROUGH HANDLING IF THE GOH COULD GET ITS HANDS ON THEM,  BUT AT NO TIME DID PRESIDENT DUVALIER ANNOUNCE HE WOULD  CONFIDENTIAL         LIQUIDATE OR EXECUTE THEM. \n3.   CORRECT TRANSLATION OF PARTS OF DUVALIER S CREOLE ADDRESS CITED BY MEXICANS ( MEXICO 700)  WOULD READ AS FOLLOWS:   "" I TOOK THAT DECISION ( ON THE KIDNAPPING)  BECAUSE I HAD GOOD REASON FOR IT.   FOR TTOWN MEETING OF ENGLISH- SPEAKING UNIVERSITY HEADS WITH PRIME MINISTER ( CAPE TOWN 223)  HORWOOD EXPRESSED HIS "" WHOLEHEARTED""  APPROVAL OF PRIMIN S STATEMENT AS PER REFTEL.

HIS STATEMENTS,  INDEED,  MAY LEND FURTHER FUEL TO THE FLAME OF PROTEST IN NATAL AGAINST RECENT NUSAS AND SASO BANNINGS.  HOLMES\n",741828

POSSIBLY BUT DOUBTFULLY MINISTER OF STATE MUWALO DROPPED THE BALL. IN ANY CASE PRESIDENT BANDA APPARENTLY NOT FOREWARNED OF CONFERENCE AND BECAME ANNOYED WHEN METHODIST BISHOPS STARTED TO ARRIVE IN BLANTYRE. IRRITATION TURNED INTO ""EXPLOSION"" WHEN BISHOP MUZOREWA TURNED UP UNANNOUNCED. PRESIDENT MAY HAVE CONSTRUED BISHOPS FAILURE TO SEND HIM PERSONAL WORD OF HIS TRIP AS A SLIGHT, ESPECIALLY IN LIGHT OF HIS INVITATION TO BISHOP TO ATTEND MALAWI CONGRASS PARTY CONFERENCE LAST SEPTEMBER (BLANTYRE 1070) WHICH WAS MADE IMPOSSIBLE BY SMITHS REFUSAL TO GRANT PASSPORT. APPREHENSION OVER REPERCUSSIONS FROM ANY MEETING ON MALAWI SOIL BETWEEN BRITISH FONSEC AND BISHOP MAY HAVE BEEN FACTOR BUT SUBORDINATE TO PRESIDENT BANDAS PIQUE AT LACK OF FOREKNOWLEDGE BISHOPS VISIT AND OPPORTUNITY PLAY ROLE IN FACILITATING ANY SUCH MEETING.

SUMMARY. AGOSTINHO NETO ASKED JOAQUIM PINTO DE ANDRADE TO PARTICIPATE IN THE TRANSITIONAL GOVERNMENT. ANDRADE AND OTHER MEMBERS OF THE ""REVOLTA ACTIVA"" HAVE REFUSED TO COOPERATE WITH NETO UNLESS HE AGREES TO ACCEPT THEM AS A LEGITIMATE CURRENTO OF OPINION WITHIN THE PARTY. END SUMMARY.\n2. AFTER THE LUSAKA CONGRESS OF THE MPLA IN AUGUST OF 1974, NETO HELD AN INTERREGIONAL CONGRESS IN EASTERN ANGOLA IN SEPTEMBER, WHERE HE GATHERED TOGETHER LOYALISTS AND SET UP A NEW CENTRAL COMMITTEE. ASIDE FROM LUCIO LARA, NONE OF THE MEMBERS HAS MUCH REPUTATION OR EXPERIENCE. NO ONE DOUBTS LARS INTELLIGENCE, BUT HE IS SUPPOSED TO BE FLAWED BY A DEEP BITTERNESS AND A TERRIBLE DESIRE FOR REVENGE AGAINST WHITES. LOPO DE NASCIMENTO, THE MPLA MEMBER OF THE PRESIDENTIAL COUNCIL IS THOUGHT OF AS A PLEASANT YOUNG MAN, BUT HE HAS NOT STATURE, NO EXPERIENCE AND LITTLE INCLINATION TO STAND UP TO ANYBODY AT THIS POINT. CONFIDENTIAL ERMINIO ESCORCIO, ANOTHER MEMBER OF NETOS INNER GROUP IS DISMISSED BY SOME WHO KNOW HIM AS AN IMBECILE. NETO REALIZES THAT HS IS IN REAL TROUBLE FOR LACK OF GOOD PEOPLE AND IS TRYING TO INDUCE THE ANDRADE FACTION TO TAKE AN ACTIVE PART IN POLITICS.\n3. AS I HAVE PIECED TOGETHER THE STORY, NETO PASSED THE WORD TO JOAQUIM PINTO DE ANDRADE BEFORE OR DURING THE ALVOR CONFERENCE THAT HE WANTED HIM IN THE TRANSITIONAL GOVERNMENT, PROBABLY AS THE MPLA MEMBER OF THE PRESIDENTIAL COUNCIL, OR COLLEGIUM. ANDRADE SENT BACK WORD THAT HE WOULD ACCEPT ON THE CONDITION THAT THE ""REVOLTA ACTIVA"", OR ANDRADE FACTION, BE LEGITIMATIZED WITHIN THE PARTY AND THAT ITS VIEWS AND OPINIONS HAVE WEIGHT IN PARTY COUNCILS. NETO REFUSED AND WENT AHEAD WITH THE SELECTION OF THE PEOPLE NOW IN THE GOVERNMENT.\n4. A FEW DAYS AFTER HIS ARRIVAL IN LUANDA, NETO GRASPED THAT THINGS WERE NOT GOING WELL FOR MPLA AND HE CALLED SOME OLD FRIENDS AMONG THE REVOLTA ACTIVA AND ASKED TO TALK WITH THEM. THEY ALL REFUSED AND TOLD HIM TO TALK WITH ANDRADE. NETO THEN ARRANGED TO MEET WITH ANDRADE WHO BY THIS TIME HAD RETURNED TO LUANDA. NETO REITERATED HIS REQUEST THAT JOAQUIM PARTICIPATE. ANDRADE AGREED, BUT REITERATED HIS DEMAND THAT THE ENTIRE FACTION AND ITS OPINIONS BE ACCEPTED AND ADDED A FEW OTHERS.\n5. ANDRADE AND NETO AGREED TO NOMINATE DELEGATES TO NEGOTIATE A FORMULA ACCEPTABLE TO BOTH SIDES. THE ANDRADE FACTION HAS THREE PRINCIPAL DEMANDS: 1) EASE OUT LARA AND ESCORCIO; THEY NEED NOT NECESSARILY BE THROWN OUT OF THE PARTY, BUT THEY MUST BE PUT SOMEWHERE WHERE THEY WILL NOT HAVE MAJOR RESPONSIBILITIES;\n6. THE IMPLICATIONS TO MPLA OF THE NEGOTIATIONS ARE GREAT. NETO HAS NOBODY WITH ANY PRESTIGE OR CAPABILITY AND THE PARTY NEEDS THE ANDRADE FACTION IF MPLA IS TO HAVE A CHANCE AGAINST THE WELL ORGANIZED UNITA DRIVE FOR VOTES AND THE GROWING ACCEPTANCE OF FNLA AMONG BOTH BLACKS AND WHITES. THE ANDRADE PEOPLE HAVE NO CONFIDENTIAL INTENTION OF LEAVING THE PARTY APPARATUS IN THE HANDS OF NETO IF THEY CAN HELP IT. THEY HOPE TO BE ABLE TO REMOVE HIM FROM THE CENTER AND RELEGATE HIM TO THE ROLE OF PARTY HERO AND ELDER STATESMAN. I HAVE REAL DOUBTS THAT THE ANDRADE FACTION CAN TAKE AWAY FROM NETO ALL THE LEVERS OF POWER. THEY HAVE NOT SHOWN MUCH STOMACH FOR POLITICAL INFIGHTING, WHILE NETO WILL STOP AT NOTHING TO RETAIN POWER. ANDRADE AND COMPANY DO HAVE A USEFUL WEAPON - DENIAL - NOW THAT NETO SEES HIS PRESENT CADRE IS NOT UP TO THE JOB THAT MUST BE DONE. IT IS A SAD COMMENTARY ON NETOS LEADERSHIP THAT MPLA, WHICH WAS TOUTED AS HAVING THE BEST TALENT AND THE GREATEST DEPTH AMONG THE LIBERATION MOVEMENTS NOT ONLY IS THE WEAKEST GROUP IN THE GOVERNMENT, IT HAS THE REPUTATION OF A GANG OF TOUGHS.

MINERS IN CATAVI AND SIGLO DECLARED A 48-HOUR STRIKE FEBRUARY 1 TO PROTEST THE LACK OF BASIC FOODS IN THE COMIBOL COMMISSARIES. LEADERS OF THESE UNIONS ALSO ATTACKED THE MINERS FEDERATION (FSTMB) FOR SIGNING WAGE SETTLEMENTS WITH COMIBOL (LA PAZ 613) DESCRIBING THE 25 PERCENT WAGE INCREASE AS INSUFFICIENT.\n2. FSTMB LEADERS EXPLAINED IN CONFIDENCE TO LABATT THAT LEADERS FROM CATAVI, SIGLO XX AND SAN JOSE HAD OPPOSED THE SETTLEMENT BUT WERE VOTED DOWN BY A MAJORITY OF DELEGATES FROM THE ENTIRE NATIONALIZED MINING SECTOR.\n3. FSTMB LEADERS ASCRIBE OPPOSITION TO THE SETTLEMENT AND THE CURRENT STRIKES TO DIFFERENCES IN POLITICAL STRATEGY BETWEEN THEM- SELVES AND FAR LEFT LEADERSHIP (TROTSKYITE, PEKING) IN THE MINES MENTIONED. FAR LEFTISTS BELIEVE THAT BANZERS DAYS ARE NUMBERED AND THAT NOW IS THE TIME TO MAXIMIZE PRESSURE ON HIM. FSTMS LEADERS BELIEVE THAT WHILE BANZER MAY BE SHAKY, THERE IS NO CHANCE OF DRIVING THE MILITARY FROM POWER. THE FSTMB BELIEVES CONFIDENTIAL THAT IF BANZER WERE OUSTED, HE WOULD BE REPLACED BY SOME OTHER OFFICER AND THE CHANCES ARE THAT THAT OFFICER WOULD BE ""EVEN WORSE THAN BANZER"" FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF THE WORKING CLASS. THE FSTMB THEREFORE PREFERS TO SIT OUT THE CURRENT WAVE OF TENSIONS AND AVOID GIVING ANYONE AN EXCUSE TO CLOSE DOWN THE FEDERATION. AS TIME HAS PASSED, FSTMB LEADERS FEEL BANZERS CHANCES OF SURVIVAL HAVE IMPROVED SIGNIFICANTLY AND THAT THE FSTMB STRATEGY HAS BEEN VINDICATED.\n4. COMMENT: THE UNIONS IN CATAVI, SIGLO XX AND SAN JOSE REPRESENT A SIGNIFICANT MINORITY OF THE FSTMB. THEIR DEFIANCE REPRESENTS AN IMPORTANT CHALLENGE TO SECCRETARY GENERAL VICTOR LOPEZ AND HIS POLICY OF DEEMPHASIZING THE POLITICAL ACTIVITIES OF THE FSTMB IN FAVOR OF OBTAINING IMPROVED WAGES AND WORKING CONDITIONS FOR THE MINERS.

SUMMARY. AGOSTINHO NETO ASKED JOAQUIM PINTO DE ANDRADE TO PARTICIPATE IN THE TRANSITIONAL GOVERNMENT. ANDRADE AND OTHER MEMBERS OF THE ""REVOLTA ACTIVA"" HAVE REFUSED TO COOPERATE WITH NETO UNLESS HE AGREES TO ACCEPT THEM AS A LEGITIMATE CURRENTO OF OPINION WITHIN THE PARTY. END SUMMARY.\n2. AFTER THE LUSAKA CONGRESS OF THE MPLA IN AUGUST OF 1974, NETO HELD AN INTERREGIONAL CONGRESS IN EASTERN ANGOLA IN SEPTEMBER, WHERE HE GATHERED TOGETHER LOYALISTS AND SET UP A NEW CENTRAL COMMITTEE. ASIDE FROM LUCIO LARA, NONE OF THE MEMBERS HAS MUCH REPUTATION OR EXPERIENCE. NO ONE DOUBTS LARS INTELLIGENCE, BUT HE IS SUPPOSED TO BE FLAWED BY A DEEP BITTERNESS AND A TERRIBLE DESIRE FOR REVENGE AGAINST WHITES. LOPO DE NASCIMENTO, THE MPLA MEMBER OF THE PRESIDENTIAL COUNCIL IS THOUGHT OF AS A PLEASANT YOUNG MAN, BUT HE HAS NOT STATURE, NO EXPERIENCE AND LITTLE INCLINATION TO STAND UP TO ANYBODY AT THIS POINT. CONFIDENTIAL ERMINIO ESCORCIO, ANOTHER MEMBER OF NETOS INNER GROUP IS DISMISSED BY SOME WHO KNOW HIM AS AN IMBECILE. NETO REALIZES THAT HS IS IN REAL TROUBLE FOR LACK OF GOOD PEOPLE AND IS TRYING TO INDUCE THE ANDRADE FACTION TO TAKE AN ACTIVE PART IN POLITICS.\n3. AS I HAVE PIECED TOGETHER THE STORY, NETO PASSED THE WORD TO JOAQUIM PINTO DE ANDRADE BEFORE OR DURING THE ALVOR CONFERENCE THAT HE WANTED HIM IN THE TRANSITIONAL GOVERNMENT, PROBABLY AS THE MPLA MEMBER OF THE PRESIDENTIAL COUNCIL, OR COLLEGIUM. ANDRADE SENT BACK WORD THAT HE WOULD ACCEPT ON THE CONDITION THAT THE ""REVOLTA ACTIVA"", OR ANDRADE FACTION, BE LEGITIMATIZED WITHIN THE PARTY AND THAT ITS VIEWS AND OPINIONS HAVE WEIGHT IN PARTY COUNCILS. NETO REFUSED AND WENT AHEAD WITH THE SELECTION OF THE PEOPLE NOW IN THE GOVERNMENT.\n4. A FEW DAYS AFTER HIS ARRIVAL IN LUANDA, NETO GRASPED THAT THINGS WERE NOT GOING WELL FOR MPLA AND HE CALLED SOME OLD FRIENDS AMONG THE REVOLTA ACTIVA AND ASKED TO TALK WITH THEM. THEY ALL REFUSED AND TOLD HIM TO TALK WITH ANDRADE. NETO THEN ARRANGED TO MEET WITH ANDRADE WHO BY THIS TIME HAD RETURNED TO LUANDA. NETO REITERATED HIS REQUEST THAT JOAQUIM PARTICIPATE. ANDRADE AGREED, BUT REITERATED HIS DEMAND THAT THE ENTIRE FACTION AND ITS OPINIONS BE ACCEPTED AND ADDED A FEW OTHERS.\n5. ANDRADE AND NETO AGREED TO NOMINATE DELEGATES TO NEGOTIATE A FORMULA ACCEPTABLE TO BOTH SIDES. THE ANDRADE FACTION HAS THREE PRINCIPAL DEMANDS: 1) EASE OUT LARA AND ESCORCIO; THEY NEED NOT NECESSARILY BE THROWN OUT OF THE PARTY, BUT THEY MUST BE PUT SOMEWHERE WHERE THEY WILL NOT HAVE MAJOR RESPONSIBILITIES;\n6. THE IMPLICATIONS TO MPLA OF THE NEGOTIATIONS ARE GREAT. NETO HAS NOBODY WITH ANY PRESTIGE OR CAPABILITY AND THE PARTY NEEDS THE ANDRADE FACTION IF MPLA IS TO HAVE A CHANCE AGAINST THE WELL ORGANIZED UNITA DRIVE FOR VOTES AND THE GROWING ACCEPTANCE OF FNLA AMONG BOTH BLACKS AND WHITES. THE ANDRADE PEOPLE HAVE NO CONFIDENTIAL INTENTION OF LEAVING THE PARTY APPARATUS IN THE HANDS OF NETO IF THEY CAN HELP IT. THEY HOPE TO BE ABLE TO REMOVE HIM FROM THE CENTER AND RELEGATE HIM TO THE ROLE OF PARTY HERO AND ELDER STATESMAN. I HAVE REAL DOUBTS THAT THE ANDRADE FACTION CAN TAKE AWAY FROM NETO ALL THE LEVERS OF POWER. THEY HAVE NOT SHOWN MUCH STOMACH FOR POLITICAL INFIGHTING, WHILE NETO WILL STOP AT NOTHING TO RETAIN POWER. ANDRADE AND COMPANY DO HAVE A USEFUL WEAPON - DENIAL - NOW THAT NETO SEES HIS PRESENT CADRE IS NOT UP TO THE JOB THAT MUST BE DONE. IT IS A SAD COMMENTARY ON NETOS LEADERSHIP THAT MPLA, WHICH WAS TOUTED AS HAVING THE BEST TALENT AND THE GREATEST DEPTH AMONG THE LIBERATION MOVEMENTS NOT ONLY IS THE WEAKEST GROUP IN THE GOVERNMENT, IT HAS THE REPUTATION OF A GANG OF TOUGHS.

SUMMARY. AGOSTINHO NETO ASKED JOAQUIM PINTO DE ANDRADE TO PARTICIPATE IN THE TRANSITIONAL GOVERNMENT. ANDRADE AND OTHER MEMBERS OF THE ""REVOLTA ACTIVA"" HAVE REFUSED TO COOPERATE WITH NETO UNLESS HE AGREES TO ACCEPT THEM AS A LEGITIMATE CURRENTO OF OPINION WITHIN THE PARTY. END SUMMARY.\n2. AFTER THE LUSAKA CONGRESS OF THE MPLA IN AUGUST OF 1974, NETO HELD AN INTERREGIONAL CONGRESS IN EASTERN ANGOLA IN SEPTEMBER, WHERE HE GATHERED TOGETHER LOYALISTS AND SET UP A NEW CENTRAL COMMITTEE. ASIDE FROM LUCIO LARA, NONE OF THE MEMBERS HAS MUCH REPUTATION OR EXPERIENCE. NO ONE DOUBTS LARS INTELLIGENCE, BUT HE IS SUPPOSED TO BE FLAWED BY A DEEP BITTERNESS AND A TERRIBLE DESIRE FOR REVENGE AGAINST WHITES. LOPO DE NASCIMENTO, THE MPLA MEMBER OF THE PRESIDENTIAL COUNCIL IS THOUGHT OF AS A PLEASANT YOUNG MAN, BUT HE HAS NOT STATURE, NO EXPERIENCE AND LITTLE INCLINATION TO STAND UP TO ANYBODY AT THIS POINT. CONFIDENTIAL ERMINIO ESCORCIO, ANOTHER MEMBER OF NETOS INNER GROUP IS DISMISSED BY SOME WHO KNOW HIM AS AN IMBECILE. NETO REALIZES THAT HS IS IN REAL TROUBLE FOR LACK OF GOOD PEOPLE AND IS TRYING TO INDUCE THE ANDRADE FACTION TO TAKE AN ACTIVE PART IN POLITICS.\n3. AS I HAVE PIECED TOGETHER THE STORY, NETO PASSED THE WORD TO JOAQUIM PINTO DE ANDRADE BEFORE OR DURING THE ALVOR CONFERENCE THAT HE WANTED HIM IN THE TRANSITIONAL GOVERNMENT, PROBABLY AS THE MPLA MEMBER OF THE PRESIDENTIAL COUNCIL, OR COLLEGIUM. ANDRADE SENT BACK WORD THAT HE WOULD ACCEPT ON THE CONDITION THAT THE ""REVOLTA ACTIVA"", OR ANDRADE FACTION, BE LEGITIMATIZED WITHIN THE PARTY AND THAT ITS VIEWS AND OPINIONS HAVE WEIGHT IN PARTY COUNCILS. NETO REFUSED AND WENT AHEAD WITH THE SELECTION OF THE PEOPLE NOW IN THE GOVERNMENT.\n4. A FEW DAYS AFTER HIS ARRIVAL IN LUANDA, NETO GRASPED THAT THINGS WERE NOT GOING WELL FOR MPLA AND HE CALLED SOME OLD FRIENDS AMONG THE REVOLTA ACTIVA AND ASKED TO TALK WITH THEM. THEY ALL REFUSED AND TOLD HIM TO TALK WITH ANDRADE. NETO THEN ARRANGED TO MEET WITH ANDRADE WHO BY THIS TIME HAD RETURNED TO LUANDA. NETO REITERATED HIS REQUEST THAT JOAQUIM PARTICIPATE. ANDRADE AGREED, BUT REITERATED HIS DEMAND THAT THE ENTIRE FACTION AND ITS OPINIONS BE ACCEPTED AND ADDED A FEW OTHERS.\n5. ANDRADE AND NETO AGREED TO NOMINATE DELEGATES TO NEGOTIATE A FORMULA ACCEPTABLE TO BOTH SIDES. THE ANDRADE FACTION HAS THREE PRINCIPAL DEMANDS: 1) EASE OUT LARA AND ESCORCIO; THEY NEED NOT NECESSARILY BE THROWN OUT OF THE PARTY, BUT THEY MUST BE PUT SOMEWHERE WHERE THEY WILL NOT HAVE MAJOR RESPONSIBILITIES;\n6. THE IMPLICATIONS TO MPLA OF THE NEGOTIATIONS ARE GREAT. NETO HAS NOBODY WITH ANY PRESTIGE OR CAPABILITY AND THE PARTY NEEDS THE ANDRADE FACTION IF MPLA IS TO HAVE A CHANCE AGAINST THE WELL ORGANIZED UNITA DRIVE FOR VOTES AND THE GROWING ACCEPTANCE OF FNLA AMONG BOTH BLACKS AND WHITES. THE ANDRADE PEOPLE HAVE NO CONFIDENTIAL INTENTION OF LEAVING THE PARTY APPARATUS IN THE HANDS OF NETO IF THEY CAN HELP IT. THEY HOPE TO BE ABLE TO REMOVE HIM FROM THE CENTER AND RELEGATE HIM TO THE ROLE OF PARTY HERO AND ELDER STATESMAN. I HAVE REAL DOUBTS THAT THE ANDRADE FACTION CAN TAKE AWAY FROM NETO ALL THE LEVERS OF POWER. THEY HAVE NOT SHOWN MUCH STOMACH FOR POLITICAL INFIGHTING, WHILE NETO WILL STOP AT NOTHING TO RETAIN POWER. ANDRADE AND COMPANY DO HAVE A USEFUL WEAPON - DENIAL - NOW THAT NETO SEES HIS PRESENT CADRE IS NOT UP TO THE JOB THAT MUST BE DONE. IT IS A SAD COMMENTARY ON NETOS LEADERSHIP THAT MPLA, WHICH WAS TOUTED AS HAVING THE BEST TALENT AND THE GREATEST DEPTH AMONG THE LIBERATION MOVEMENTS NOT ONLY IS THE WEAKEST GROUP IN THE GOVERNMENT, IT HAS THE REPUTATION OF A GANG OF TOUGHS.

TO SET THE RECORD STRAIGHT ON THIS POINT,  DUVALIER IN CREOLE ADDRESS JANUARY 26  ( HIS ONLY PUBLIC STATEMENT ON KIDNAPPERS)  SAID IF THEY RETURNED TO HAITI HE WOULD "" BE WAITING FOR THEM WITH A BIG COCOMACAQUE"".   A COCOMACAQUE IS A HEAVY STICK SIMILAR TO AN IRISH SHILLELAGH AND USED FOR THE SAME PURPOSES.   THE INFERENCE WAS CLEARLY THAT THE KIDNAPPERS WOULD BE IN FOR ROUGH HANDLING IF THE GOH COULD GET ITS HANDS ON THEM,  BUT AT NO TIME DID PRESIDENT DUVALIER ANNOUNCE HE WOULD  CONFIDENTIAL         LIQUIDATE OR EXECUTE THEM. \n3.   CORRECT TRANSLATION OF PARTS OF DUVALIER S CREOLE ADDRESS CITED BY MEXICANS ( MEXICO 700)  WOULD READ AS FOLLOWS:   "" I TOOK THAT DECISION ( ON THE KIDNAPPING)  BECAUSE I HAD GOOD REASON FOR IT.

MINERS IN CATAVI AND SIGLO DECLARED A 48-HOUR STRIKE FEBRUARY 1 TO PROTEST THE LACK OF BASIC FOODS IN THE COMIBOL COMMISSARIES. LEADERS OF THESE UNIONS ALSO ATTACKED THE MINERS FEDERATION (FSTMB) FOR SIGNING WAGE SETTLEMENTS WITH COMIBOL (LA PAZ 613) DESCRIBING THE 25 PERCENT WAGE INCREASE AS INSUFFICIENT.\n2. FSTMB LEADERS EXPLAINED IN CONFIDENCE TO LABATT THAT LEADERS FROM CATAVI, SIGLO XX AND SAN JOSE HAD OPPOSED THE SETTLEMENT BUT WERE VOTED DOWN BY A MAJORITY OF DELEGATES FROM THE ENTIRE NATIONALIZED MINING SECTOR.\n3. FSTMB LEADERS ASCRIBE OPPOSITION TO THE SETTLEMENT AND THE CURRENT STRIKES TO DIFFERENCES IN POLITICAL STRATEGY BETWEEN THEM- SELVES AND FAR LEFT LEADERSHIP (TROTSKYITE, PEKING) IN THE MINES MENTIONED. FAR LEFTISTS BELIEVE THAT BANZERS DAYS ARE NUMBERED AND THAT NOW IS THE TIME TO MAXIMIZE PRESSURE ON HIM. FSTMS LEADERS BELIEVE THAT WHILE BANZER MAY BE SHAKY, THERE IS NO CHANCE OF DRIVING THE MILITARY FROM POWER. THE FSTMB BELIEVES CONFIDENTIAL THAT IF BANZER WERE OUSTED, HE WOULD BE REPLACED BY SOME OTHER OFFICER AND THE CHANCES ARE THAT THAT OFFICER WOULD BE ""EVEN WORSE THAN BANZER"" FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF THE WORKING CLASS. THE FSTMB THEREFORE PREFERS TO SIT OUT THE CURRENT WAVE OF TENSIONS AND AVOID GIVING ANYONE AN EXCUSE TO CLOSE DOWN THE FEDERATION. AS TIME HAS PASSED, FSTMB LEADERS FEEL BANZERS CHANCES OF SURVIVAL HAVE IMPROVED SIGNIFICANTLY AND THAT THE FSTMB STRATEGY HAS BEEN VINDICATED.\n4. COMMENT: THE UNIONS IN CATAVI, SIGLO XX AND SAN JOSE REPRESENT A SIGNIFICANT MINORITY OF THE FSTMB. THEIR DEFIANCE REPRESENTS AN IMPORTANT CHALLENGE TO SECCRETARY GENERAL VICTOR LOPEZ AND HIS POLICY OF DEEMPHASIZING THE POLITICAL ACTIVITIES OF THE FSTMB IN FAVOR OF OBTAINING IMPROVED WAGES AND WORKING CONDITIONS FOR THE MINERS.

A COCOMACAQUE IS A HEAVY STICK SIMILAR TO AN IRISH SHILLELAGH AND USED FOR THE SAME PURPOSES.

MINERS IN CATAVI AND SIGLO DECLARED A 48-HOUR STRIKE FEBRUARY 1 TO PROTEST THE LACK OF BASIC FOODS IN THE COMIBOL COMMISSARIES. LEADERS OF THESE UNIONS ALSO ATTACKED THE MINERS FEDERATION (FSTMB) FOR SIGNING WAGE SETTLEMENTS WITH COMIBOL (LA PAZ 613) DESCRIBING THE 25 PERCENT WAGE INCREASE AS INSUFFICIENT.\n2. FSTMB LEADERS EXPLAINED IN CONFIDENCE TO LABATT THAT LEADERS FROM CATAVI, SIGLO XX AND SAN JOSE HAD OPPOSED THE SETTLEMENT BUT WERE VOTED DOWN BY A MAJORITY OF DELEGATES FROM THE ENTIRE NATIONALIZED MINING SECTOR.\n3. FSTMB LEADERS ASCRIBE OPPOSITION TO THE SETTLEMENT AND THE CURRENT STRIKES TO DIFFERENCES IN POLITICAL STRATEGY BETWEEN THEM- SELVES AND FAR LEFT LEADERSHIP (TROTSKYITE, PEKING) IN THE MINES MENTIONED. FAR LEFTISTS BELIEVE THAT BANZERS DAYS ARE NUMBERED AND THAT NOW IS THE TIME TO MAXIMIZE PRESSURE ON HIM. FSTMS LEADERS BELIEVE THAT WHILE BANZER MAY BE SHAKY, THERE IS NO CHANCE OF DRIVING THE MILITARY FROM POWER. THE FSTMB BELIEVES CONFIDENTIAL THAT IF BANZER WERE OUSTED, HE WOULD BE REPLACED BY SOME OTHER OFFICER AND THE CHANCES ARE THAT THAT OFFICER WOULD BE ""EVEN WORSE THAN BANZER"" FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF THE WORKING CLASS. THE FSTMB THEREFORE PREFERS TO SIT OUT THE CURRENT WAVE OF TENSIONS AND AVOID GIVING ANYONE AN EXCUSE TO CLOSE DOWN THE FEDERATION. AS TIME HAS PASSED, FSTMB LEADERS FEEL BANZERS CHANCES OF SURVIVAL HAVE IMPROVED SIGNIFICANTLY AND THAT THE FSTMB STRATEGY HAS BEEN VINDICATED.\n4. COMMENT: THE UNIONS IN CATAVI, SIGLO XX AND SAN JOSE REPRESENT A SIGNIFICANT MINORITY OF THE FSTMB. THEIR DEFIANCE REPRESENTS AN IMPORTANT CHALLENGE TO SECCRETARY GENERAL VICTOR LOPEZ AND HIS POLICY OF DEEMPHASIZING THE POLITICAL ACTIVITIES OF THE FSTMB IN FAVOR OF OBTAINING IMPROVED WAGES AND WORKING CONDITIONS FOR THE MINERS.

SANDERHOFF ,frus1969-76ve08d108,"1. SUMMARY. AGOSTINHO NETO ASKED JOAQUIM PINTO DE ANDRADE TO PARTICIPATE IN THE TRANSITIONAL GOVERNMENT. ANDRADE AND OTHER MEMBERS OF THE ""REVOLTA ACTIVA"" HAVE REFUSED TO COOPERATE WITH NETO UNLESS HE AGREES TO ACCEPT THEM AS A LEGITIMATE CURRENTO OF OPINION WITHIN THE PARTY. END SUMMARY.\n2. AFTER THE LUSAKA CONGRESS OF THE MPLA IN AUGUST OF 1974, NETO HELD AN INTERREGIONAL CONGRESS IN EASTERN ANGOLA IN SEPTEMBER, WHERE HE GATHERED TOGETHER LOYALISTS AND SET UP A NEW CENTRAL COMMITTEE. ASIDE FROM LUCIO LARA, NONE OF THE MEMBERS HAS MUCH REPUTATION OR EXPERIENCE. NO ONE DOUBTS LARS INTELLIGENCE, BUT HE IS SUPPOSED TO BE FLAWED BY A DEEP BITTERNESS AND A TERRIBLE DESIRE FOR REVENGE AGAINST WHITES. LOPO DE NASCIMENTO, THE MPLA MEMBER OF THE PRESIDENTIAL COUNCIL IS THOUGHT OF AS A PLEASANT YOUNG MAN, BUT HE HAS NOT STATURE, NO EXPERIENCE AND LITTLE INCLINATION TO STAND UP TO ANYBODY AT THIS POINT. CONFIDENTIAL ERMINIO ESCORCIO, ANOTHER MEMBER OF NETOS INNER GROUP IS DISMISSED BY SOME WHO KNOW HIM AS AN IMBECILE. NETO REALIZES THAT HS IS IN REAL TROUBLE FOR LACK OF GOOD PEOPLE AND IS TRYING TO INDUCE THE ANDRADE FACTION TO TAKE AN ACTIVE PART IN POLITICS.\n3. AS I HAVE PIECED TOGETHER THE STORY, NETO PASSED THE WORD TO JOAQUIM PINTO DE ANDRADE BEFORE OR DURING THE ALVOR CONFERENCE THAT HE WANTED HIM IN THE TRANSITIONAL GOVERNMENT, PROBABLY AS THE MPLA MEMBER OF THE PRESIDENTIAL COUNCIL, OR COLLEGIUM. ANDRADE SENT BACK WORD THAT HE WOULD ACCEPT ON THE CONDITION THAT THE ""REVOLTA ACTIVA"", OR ANDRADE FACTION, BE LEGITIMATIZED WITHIN THE PARTY AND THAT ITS VIEWS AND OPINIONS HAVE WEIGHT IN PARTY COUNCILS. NETO REFUSED AND WENT AHEAD WITH THE SELECTION OF THE PEOPLE NOW IN THE GOVERNMENT.\n4. A FEW DAYS AFTER HIS ARRIVAL IN LUANDA, NETO GRASPED THAT THINGS WERE NOT GOING WELL FOR MPLA AND HE CALLED SOME OLD FRIENDS AMONG THE REVOLTA ACTIVA AND ASKED TO TALK WITH THEM.

ANDRADE AGREED, BUT REITERATED HIS DEMAND THAT THE ENTIRE FACTION AND ITS OPINIONS BE ACCEPTED AND ADDED A FEW OTHERS.\n5. ANDRADE AND NETO AGREED TO NOMINATE DELEGATES TO NEGOTIATE A FORMULA ACCEPTABLE TO BOTH SIDES. THE ANDRADE FACTION HAS THREE PRINCIPAL DEMANDS: 1) EASE OUT LARA AND ESCORCIO; THEY NEED NOT NECESSARILY BE THROWN OUT OF THE PARTY, BUT THEY MUST BE PUT SOMEWHERE WHERE THEY WILL NOT HAVE MAJOR RESPONSIBILITIES;\n6. THE IMPLICATIONS TO MPLA OF THE NEGOTIATIONS ARE GREAT. NETO HAS NOBODY WITH ANY PRESTIGE OR CAPABILITY AND THE PARTY NEEDS THE ANDRADE FACTION IF MPLA IS TO HAVE A CHANCE AGAINST THE WELL ORGANIZED UNITA DRIVE FOR VOTES AND THE GROWING ACCEPTANCE OF FNLA AMONG BOTH BLACKS AND WHITES. THE ANDRADE PEOPLE HAVE NO CONFIDENTIAL INTENTION OF LEAVING THE PARTY APPARATUS IN THE HANDS OF NETO IF THEY CAN HELP IT. THEY HOPE TO BE ABLE TO REMOVE HIM FROM THE CENTER AND RELEGATE HIM TO THE ROLE OF PARTY HERO AND ELDER STATESMAN. I HAVE REAL DOUBTS THAT THE ANDRADE FACTION CAN TAKE AWAY FROM NETO ALL THE LEVERS OF POWER. THEY HAVE NOT SHOWN MUCH STOMACH FOR POLITICAL INFIGHTING, WHILE NETO WILL STOP AT NOTHING TO RETAIN POWER. ANDRADE AND COMPANY DO HAVE A USEFUL WEAPON - DENIAL - NOW THAT NETO SEES HIS PRESENT CADRE IS NOT UP TO THE JOB THAT MUST BE DONE. IT IS A SAD COMMENTARY ON NETOS LEADERSHIP THAT MPLA, WHICH WAS TOUTED AS HAVING THE BEST TALENT AND THE GREATEST DEPTH AMONG THE LIBERATION MOVEMENTS NOT ONLY IS THE WEAKEST GROUP IN THE GOVERNMENT, IT HAS THE REPUTATION OF A GANG OF TOUGHS.

MINERS IN CATAVI AND SIGLO DECLARED A 48-HOUR STRIKE FEBRUARY 1 TO PROTEST THE LACK OF BASIC FOODS IN THE COMIBOL COMMISSARIES. LEADERS OF THESE UNIONS ALSO ATTACKED THE MINERS FEDERATION (FSTMB) FOR SIGNING WAGE SETTLEMENTS WITH COMIBOL (LA PAZ 613) DESCRIBING THE 25 PERCENT WAGE INCREASE AS INSUFFICIENT.\n2. FSTMB LEADERS EXPLAINED IN CONFIDENCE TO LABATT THAT LEADERS FROM CATAVI, SIGLO XX AND SAN JOSE HAD OPPOSED THE SETTLEMENT BUT WERE VOTED DOWN BY A MAJORITY OF DELEGATES FROM THE ENTIRE NATIONALIZED MINING SECTOR.\n3. FSTMB LEADERS ASCRIBE OPPOSITION TO THE SETTLEMENT AND THE CURRENT STRIKES TO DIFFERENCES IN POLITICAL STRATEGY BETWEEN THEM- SELVES AND FAR LEFT LEADERSHIP (TROTSKYITE, PEKING) IN THE MINES MENTIONED. FAR LEFTISTS BELIEVE THAT BANZERS DAYS ARE NUMBERED AND THAT NOW IS THE TIME TO MAXIMIZE PRESSURE ON HIM. FSTMS LEADERS BELIEVE THAT WHILE BANZER MAY BE SHAKY, THERE IS NO CHANCE OF DRIVING THE MILITARY FROM POWER. THE FSTMB BELIEVES CONFIDENTIAL THAT IF BANZER WERE OUSTED, HE WOULD BE REPLACED BY SOME OTHER OFFICER AND THE CHANCES ARE THAT THAT OFFICER WOULD BE ""EVEN WORSE THAN BANZER"" FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF THE WORKING CLASS. THE FSTMB THEREFORE PREFERS TO SIT OUT THE CURRENT WAVE OF TENSIONS AND AVOID GIVING ANYONE AN EXCUSE TO CLOSE DOWN THE FEDERATION. AS TIME HAS PASSED, FSTMB LEADERS FEEL BANZERS CHANCES OF SURVIVAL HAVE IMPROVED SIGNIFICANTLY AND THAT THE FSTMB STRATEGY HAS BEEN VINDICATED.\n4. COMMENT: THE UNIONS IN CATAVI, SIGLO XX AND SAN JOSE REPRESENT A SIGNIFICANT MINORITY OF THE FSTMB. THEIR DEFIANCE REPRESENTS AN IMPORTANT CHALLENGE TO SECCRETARY GENERAL VICTOR LOPEZ AND HIS POLICY OF DEEMPHASIZING THE POLITICAL ACTIVITIES OF THE FSTMB IN FAVOR OF OBTAINING IMPROVED WAGES AND WORKING CONDITIONS FOR THE MINERS.

WHOM I HAVE SPOKEN THIS WEEK                            MENTIONED ABOVE INCLUDING IRANIAN CHARGE GIVES MUCH CREDENCE TO                            THESIS THAT GUNS WERE ACTUALLY INTENDED FOR USE IN

     I FIND IT HARD TO BELIEVE THAT IRAQ WOULD HAVE PULLED OFF SUCH A CAPER                            WITHOUT AT LEAST KNOWLEDGE IF NOT COMPLICITY OF SOVS BUT MAYBE THAT IS                            SO BECAUSE I MISJUDGE IRAQI CAPABILITY FOR INDEPENDENT IRRESPONSIBLE                            ACT ON OTHER HAND I RECOGNIZE THAT IF SOVS WERE ACCOMPLICES OR AT                            LEAST

                        FACTS EXCEPT THAT SOME WEAPONS OF SOV ORIGIN WERE SHIPPED COVERTLY BY                            THE IRAQIS TO ISLAMABAD ALTHOUGH IT IS DISAPPOINTING TO EMERGE WITH                            THESE MAJOR UNCERTAINTIES WE ARE NOT ALONE WITH THEM THE LEAST WE CAN                            DO IS TO KEEP ON ALERT FOR FURTHER FACTS WHILE RECOGNIZING WE MAY NEVER                            GET TO THE BOTTOM OF THIS CURIOUS AFFAIR  GDS SOBER,frus1969-76ve08d109,"1. SUMMARY. AGOSTINHO NETO ASKED JOAQUIM PINTO DE ANDRADE TO PARTICIPATE IN THE TRANSITIONAL GOVERNMENT. ANDRADE AND OTHER MEMBERS OF THE ""REVOLTA ACTIVA"" HAVE REFUSED TO COOPERATE WITH NETO UNLESS HE AGREES TO ACCEPT THEM AS A LEGITIMATE CURRENTO OF OPINION WITHIN THE PARTY. END SUMMARY.\n2. AFTER THE LUSAKA CONGRESS OF THE MPLA IN AUGUST OF 1974, NETO HELD AN INTERREGIONAL CONGRESS IN EASTERN ANGOLA IN SEPTEMBER, WHERE HE GATHERED TOGETHER LOYALISTS AND SET UP A NEW CENTRAL COMMITTEE. ASIDE FROM LUCIO LARA, NONE OF THE MEMBERS HAS MUCH REPUTATION OR EXPERIENCE. NO ONE DOUBTS LARS INTELLIGENCE, BUT HE IS SUPPOSED TO BE FLAWED BY A DEEP BITTERNESS AND A TERRIBLE DESIRE FOR REVENGE AGAINST WHITES. LOPO DE NASCIMENTO, THE MPLA MEMBER OF THE PRESIDENTIAL COUNCIL IS THOUGHT OF AS A PLEASANT YOUNG MAN, BUT HE HAS NOT STATURE, NO EXPERIENCE AND LITTLE INCLINATION TO STAND UP TO ANYBODY AT THIS POINT. CONFIDENTIAL ERMINIO ESCORCIO, ANOTHER MEMBER OF NETOS INNER GROUP IS DISMISSED BY SOME WHO KNOW HIM AS AN IMBECILE. NETO REALIZES THAT HS IS IN REAL TROUBLE FOR LACK OF GOOD PEOPLE AND IS TRYING TO INDUCE THE ANDRADE FACTION TO TAKE AN ACTIVE PART IN POLITICS.\n3. AS I HAVE PIECED TOGETHER THE STORY, NETO PASSED THE WORD TO JOAQUIM PINTO DE ANDRADE BEFORE OR DURING THE ALVOR CONFERENCE THAT HE WANTED HIM IN THE TRANSITIONAL GOVERNMENT, PROBABLY AS THE MPLA MEMBER OF THE PRESIDENTIAL COUNCIL, OR COLLEGIUM. ANDRADE SENT BACK WORD THAT HE WOULD ACCEPT ON THE CONDITION THAT THE ""REVOLTA ACTIVA"", OR ANDRADE FACTION, BE LEGITIMATIZED WITHIN THE PARTY AND THAT ITS VIEWS AND OPINIONS HAVE WEIGHT IN PARTY COUNCILS. NETO REFUSED AND WENT AHEAD WITH THE SELECTION OF THE PEOPLE NOW IN THE GOVERNMENT.\n4. A FEW DAYS AFTER HIS ARRIVAL IN LUANDA, NETO GRASPED THAT THINGS WERE NOT GOING WELL FOR MPLA AND HE CALLED SOME OLD FRIENDS AMONG THE REVOLTA ACTIVA AND ASKED TO TALK WITH THEM. THEY ALL REFUSED AND TOLD HIM TO TALK WITH ANDRADE. NETO THEN ARRANGED TO MEET WITH ANDRADE WHO BY THIS TIME HAD RETURNED TO LUANDA. NETO REITERATED HIS REQUEST THAT JOAQUIM PARTICIPATE. ANDRADE AGREED, BUT REITERATED HIS DEMAND THAT THE ENTIRE FACTION AND ITS OPINIONS BE ACCEPTED AND ADDED A FEW OTHERS.\n5. ANDRADE AND NETO AGREED TO NOMINATE DELEGATES TO NEGOTIATE A FORMULA ACCEPTABLE TO BOTH SIDES. THE ANDRADE FACTION HAS THREE PRINCIPAL DEMANDS: 1) EASE OUT LARA AND ESCORCIO; THEY NEED NOT NECESSARILY BE THROWN OUT OF THE PARTY, BUT THEY MUST BE PUT SOMEWHERE WHERE THEY WILL NOT HAVE MAJOR RESPONSIBILITIES;\n6. THE IMPLICATIONS TO MPLA OF THE NEGOTIATIONS ARE GREAT. NETO HAS NOBODY WITH ANY PRESTIGE OR CAPABILITY AND THE PARTY NEEDS THE ANDRADE FACTION IF MPLA IS TO HAVE A CHANCE AGAINST THE WELL ORGANIZED UNITA DRIVE FOR VOTES AND THE GROWING ACCEPTANCE OF FNLA AMONG BOTH BLACKS AND WHITES. THE ANDRADE PEOPLE HAVE NO CONFIDENTIAL INTENTION OF LEAVING THE PARTY APPARATUS IN THE HANDS OF NETO IF THEY CAN HELP IT. THEY HOPE TO BE ABLE TO REMOVE HIM FROM THE CENTER AND RELEGATE HIM TO THE ROLE OF PARTY HERO AND ELDER STATESMAN. I HAVE REAL DOUBTS THAT THE ANDRADE FACTION CAN TAKE AWAY FROM NETO ALL THE LEVERS OF POWER. THEY HAVE NOT SHOWN MUCH STOMACH FOR POLITICAL INFIGHTING, WHILE NETO WILL STOP AT NOTHING TO RETAIN POWER. ANDRADE AND COMPANY DO HAVE A USEFUL WEAPON - DENIAL - NOW THAT NETO SEES HIS PRESENT CADRE IS NOT UP TO THE JOB THAT MUST BE DONE. IT IS A SAD COMMENTARY ON NETOS LEADERSHIP THAT MPLA, WHICH WAS TOUTED AS HAVING THE BEST TALENT AND THE GREATEST DEPTH AMONG THE LIBERATION MOVEMENTS NOT ONLY IS THE WEAKEST GROUP IN THE GOVERNMENT, IT HAS THE REPUTATION OF A GANG OF TOUGHS.

EMBASSY NOTES THAT MEXICAN FOREIGN SECRETARY RABASA AND AMBASSADOR TO THE U. S.  DE OLLOQUI HAVE BOTH CITED AS ONE REASON FOR NOT EXTRADITING KNOX KIDNAPPERS TO HAITI AN ALLEGED ANNOUNCEMENT BY PRESIDENT DUVALIER THAT HE WOULD LIQUIDATE THE KIDNAPPERS IF HE COULD GET HIS HANDS ON THEM. \n2.   TO SET THE RECORD STRAIGHT ON THIS POINT,  DUVALIER IN CREOLE ADDRESS JANUARY 26  ( HIS ONLY PUBLIC STATEMENT ON KIDNAPPERS)  SAID IF THEY RETURNED TO HAITI HE WOULD "" BE WAITING FOR THEM WITH A BIG COCOMACAQUE"".   A COCOMACAQUE IS A HEAVY STICK SIMILAR TO AN IRISH SHILLELAGH AND USED FOR THE SAME PURPOSES.   THE INFERENCE WAS CLEARLY THAT THE KIDNAPPERS WOULD BE IN FOR ROUGH HANDLING IF THE GOH COULD GET ITS HANDS ON THEM,  BUT AT NO TIME DID PRESIDENT DUVALIER ANNOUNCE HE WOULD  CONFIDENTIAL         LIQUIDATE OR EXECUTE THEM. \n3.   CORRECT TRANSLATION OF PARTS OF DUVALIER S CREOLE ADDRESS CITED BY MEXICANS ( MEXICO 700)  WOULD READ AS FOLLOWS:   "" I TOOK THAT DECISION ( ON THE KIDNAPPING)  BECAUSE I HAD GOOD REASON FOR IT.   FOR TTOWN MEETING OF ENGLISH- SPEAKING UNIVERSITY HEADS WITH PRIME MINISTER ( CAPE TOWN 223)  HORWOOD EXPRESSED HIS "" WHOLEHEARTED""  APPROVAL OF PRIMIN S STATEMENT AS PER REFTEL.  "" NO UNIVERSITY HAS RIGHT TO BEHAVE IN WAY WHICH DOES NOT CONFORM WITH ACCEPTED NORMS OF COMMUNITY"".  UNIVERSITIES "" SET GREAT STORE BY THEIR AUTONOMY.  THERE IS A CONCOMITANT RESPONSIBILITY TO PUT THEIR OWN HOUSE IN ORDER"". \n3.  COMMENT:  HORWOOD S REMARKS WILL DO NOTHING TO ENDEAR HIM TO UNIVERSITY OF NATAL STUDENTS OR YOUNGER FACULTY MEMBERS,  WHO REMEMBER WITH DISDAIN HIS FEW STORMY YEARS AS PRINCIPAL BEFORE HIS APPOINTMENT TO THE SENATE IN 1970.  HIS STATEMENTS,  INDEED,  MAY LEND FURTHER FUEL TO THE FLAME OF PROTEST IN NATAL AGAINST RECENT NUSAS AND SASO BANNINGS.  HOLMES\n",741828

INTENDED WHAT WAS THEIR INTENDED USE AND WERE ANY OTHERS THAN THE                            IRAQIS INVOLVED IN SENDING THEM4 ORIGIN OF ARMS THE CENTRAL QUESTION IS WHETHER THE IRAQIS ACTED                            ALONE WE GATHER THEY MAY VERY WELL HAVE DONE SO IF THEIR PARTICULAR                            OBJECTIVE WAS TO HARASS IRAN  THERE WOULD SEEM TO BE VERY LITTLE REASON                            FOR THE IRAQIS ON THEIR OWN TO CARRY OUT AN OPERATION AGAINST PAKISTAN                            WITH WHOM THEY APPEAR GENERALLY TO HAVE BEEN TRYING TO IMPROVE THEIR

JUSTIFYING RISKS OF OPERATION AGAINST PAKISTAN ITSELF I                            SUPPOSE THERE IS ALSO POSSIBILITY THAT SOME ELEMENTS OF IRAQIS                            BODYPOLITIC SAW REASONS TO

JUSTIFYING RISKS OF OPERATION AGAINST PAKISTAN ITSELF I                            SUPPOSE THERE IS ALSO POSSIBILITY THAT SOME ELEMENTS OF IRAQIS                            BODYPOLITIC SAW REASONS TO

PARTY ACTING SOMEHOW IN COLLUSION WITH                            IRAQIS CHOICE MOST LOGICALLY FALLS ON USSR  WEAPONS ARE OF SOV ORIGIN                            AND SOVS ARE WELL ENTRENCHED IN IRAQ  SOVS HAVE INTERESTS IN                            SUBCONTINENT AND ELSEWHERE IN ASIA WHICH COULD MOTIVATE THEM TO CARRY                            OUT CLANDESTINE OPERATIONS AGAIN GOVT FACTORS COULD

WEAPONS IT IS EASIEST TO PROVIDE POLITICAL REASONING                            IF ONE ASSUMES THAT IRAQ ACTING PRESUMABLY ALONE WANTED GUNS TO CAUSE                            TROUBLE AGAINST IRAN VIA BALUCHISTAN UNFORTUNATELY BALUCHISTAN PREMISE                            DOES NOT SEEM TO MAKE MUCH SENSE ON LOGISTICAL GROUNDS LONG SOFT                            BALUCHISTAN COASTLINE ON

WHOM I HAVE SPOKEN THIS WEEK                            MENTIONED ABOVE INCLUDING IRANIAN CHARGE GIVES MUCH CREDENCE TO                            THESIS THAT GUNS WERE ACTUALLY INTENDED FOR USE IN

WE CONJECTURE THAT UNITED METHODIST CHURCH OFFICIAL RESPONSIBLE FOR ARRANGEMENTS FOR CONFERENCE MAY HAVE FAILED TO PIN DOWN OFFICIALLY AND SPECIFICALLY PERMISSION FROM GOM (I.E., PRESIDENT BANDA). POSSIBLY BUT DOUBTFULLY MINISTER OF STATE MUWALO DROPPED THE BALL. IN ANY CASE PRESIDENT BANDA APPARENTLY NOT FOREWARNED OF CONFERENCE AND BECAME ANNOYED WHEN METHODIST BISHOPS STARTED TO ARRIVE IN BLANTYRE. IRRITATION TURNED INTO ""EXPLOSION"" WHEN BISHOP MUZOREWA TURNED UP UNANNOUNCED. PRESIDENT MAY HAVE CONSTRUED BISHOPS FAILURE TO SEND HIM PERSONAL WORD OF HIS TRIP AS A SLIGHT, ESPECIALLY IN LIGHT OF HIS INVITATION TO BISHOP TO ATTEND MALAWI CONGRASS PARTY CONFERENCE LAST SEPTEMBER (BLANTYRE 1070) WHICH WAS MADE IMPOSSIBLE BY SMITHS REFUSAL TO GRANT PASSPORT.

WHOM I HAVE SPOKEN THIS WEEK                            MENTIONED ABOVE INCLUDING IRANIAN CHARGE GIVES MUCH CREDENCE TO                            THESIS THAT GUNS WERE ACTUALLY INTENDED FOR USE IN

     I FIND IT HARD TO BELIEVE THAT IRAQ WOULD HAVE PULLED OFF SUCH A CAPER                            WITHOUT AT LEAST KNOWLEDGE IF NOT COMPLICITY OF SOVS BUT MAYBE THAT IS                            SO BECAUSE I MISJUDGE IRAQI CAPABILITY FOR INDEPENDENT IRRESPONSIBLE                            ACT ON OTHER HAND I RECOGNIZE THAT IF SOVS WERE ACCOMPLICES OR AT                            LEAST

SUMMARY. AGOSTINHO NETO ASKED JOAQUIM PINTO DE ANDRADE TO PARTICIPATE IN THE TRANSITIONAL GOVERNMENT. ANDRADE AND OTHER MEMBERS OF THE ""REVOLTA ACTIVA"" HAVE REFUSED TO COOPERATE WITH NETO UNLESS HE AGREES TO ACCEPT THEM AS A LEGITIMATE CURRENTO OF OPINION WITHIN THE PARTY. END SUMMARY.\n2. AFTER THE LUSAKA CONGRESS OF THE MPLA IN AUGUST OF 1974, NETO HELD AN INTERREGIONAL CONGRESS IN EASTERN ANGOLA IN SEPTEMBER, WHERE HE GATHERED TOGETHER LOYALISTS AND SET UP A NEW CENTRAL COMMITTEE. ASIDE FROM LUCIO LARA, NONE OF THE MEMBERS HAS MUCH REPUTATION OR EXPERIENCE. NO ONE DOUBTS LARS INTELLIGENCE, BUT HE IS SUPPOSED TO BE FLAWED BY A DEEP BITTERNESS AND A TERRIBLE DESIRE FOR REVENGE AGAINST WHITES. LOPO DE NASCIMENTO, THE MPLA MEMBER OF THE PRESIDENTIAL COUNCIL IS THOUGHT OF AS A PLEASANT YOUNG MAN, BUT HE HAS NOT STATURE, NO EXPERIENCE AND LITTLE INCLINATION TO STAND UP TO ANYBODY AT THIS POINT. CONFIDENTIAL ERMINIO ESCORCIO, ANOTHER MEMBER OF NETOS INNER GROUP IS DISMISSED BY SOME WHO KNOW HIM AS AN IMBECILE. NETO REALIZES THAT HS IS IN REAL TROUBLE FOR LACK OF GOOD PEOPLE AND IS TRYING TO INDUCE THE ANDRADE FACTION TO TAKE AN ACTIVE PART IN POLITICS.\n3. AS I HAVE PIECED TOGETHER THE STORY, NETO PASSED THE WORD TO JOAQUIM PINTO DE ANDRADE BEFORE OR DURING THE ALVOR CONFERENCE THAT HE WANTED HIM IN THE TRANSITIONAL GOVERNMENT, PROBABLY AS THE MPLA MEMBER OF THE PRESIDENTIAL COUNCIL, OR COLLEGIUM. ANDRADE SENT BACK WORD THAT HE WOULD ACCEPT ON THE CONDITION THAT THE ""REVOLTA ACTIVA"", OR ANDRADE FACTION, BE LEGITIMATIZED WITHIN THE PARTY AND THAT ITS VIEWS AND OPINIONS HAVE WEIGHT IN PARTY COUNCILS. NETO REFUSED AND WENT AHEAD WITH THE SELECTION OF THE PEOPLE NOW IN THE GOVERNMENT.\n4. A FEW DAYS AFTER HIS ARRIVAL IN LUANDA, NETO GRASPED THAT THINGS WERE NOT GOING WELL FOR MPLA AND HE CALLED SOME OLD FRIENDS AMONG THE REVOLTA ACTIVA AND ASKED TO TALK WITH THEM. THEY ALL REFUSED AND TOLD HIM TO TALK WITH ANDRADE. NETO THEN ARRANGED TO MEET WITH ANDRADE WHO BY THIS TIME HAD RETURNED TO LUANDA. NETO REITERATED HIS REQUEST THAT JOAQUIM PARTICIPATE. ANDRADE AGREED, BUT REITERATED HIS DEMAND THAT THE ENTIRE FACTION AND ITS OPINIONS BE ACCEPTED AND ADDED A FEW OTHERS.\n5. ANDRADE AND NETO AGREED TO NOMINATE DELEGATES TO NEGOTIATE A FORMULA ACCEPTABLE TO BOTH SIDES. THE ANDRADE FACTION HAS THREE PRINCIPAL DEMANDS: 1) EASE OUT LARA AND ESCORCIO; THEY NEED NOT NECESSARILY BE THROWN OUT OF THE PARTY, BUT THEY MUST BE PUT SOMEWHERE WHERE THEY WILL NOT HAVE MAJOR RESPONSIBILITIES;\n6. THE IMPLICATIONS TO MPLA OF THE NEGOTIATIONS ARE GREAT. NETO HAS NOBODY WITH ANY PRESTIGE OR CAPABILITY AND THE PARTY NEEDS THE ANDRADE FACTION IF MPLA IS TO HAVE A CHANCE AGAINST THE WELL ORGANIZED UNITA DRIVE FOR VOTES AND THE GROWING ACCEPTANCE OF FNLA AMONG BOTH BLACKS AND WHITES. THE ANDRADE PEOPLE HAVE NO CONFIDENTIAL INTENTION OF LEAVING THE PARTY APPARATUS IN THE HANDS OF NETO IF THEY CAN HELP IT. THEY HOPE TO BE ABLE TO REMOVE HIM FROM THE CENTER AND RELEGATE HIM TO THE ROLE OF PARTY HERO AND ELDER STATESMAN. I HAVE REAL DOUBTS THAT THE ANDRADE FACTION CAN TAKE AWAY FROM NETO ALL THE LEVERS OF POWER. THEY HAVE NOT SHOWN MUCH STOMACH FOR POLITICAL INFIGHTING, WHILE NETO WILL STOP AT NOTHING TO RETAIN POWER. ANDRADE AND COMPANY DO HAVE A USEFUL WEAPON - DENIAL - NOW THAT NETO SEES HIS PRESENT CADRE IS NOT UP TO THE JOB THAT MUST BE DONE. IT IS A SAD COMMENTARY ON NETOS LEADERSHIP THAT MPLA, WHICH WAS TOUTED AS HAVING THE BEST TALENT AND THE GREATEST DEPTH AMONG THE LIBERATION MOVEMENTS NOT ONLY IS THE WEAKEST GROUP IN THE GOVERNMENT, IT HAS THE REPUTATION OF A GANG OF TOUGHS.

EMBASSY NOTES THAT MEXICAN FOREIGN SECRETARY RABASA AND AMBASSADOR TO THE U. S.  DE OLLOQUI HAVE BOTH CITED AS ONE REASON FOR NOT EXTRADITING KNOX KIDNAPPERS TO HAITI AN ALLEGED ANNOUNCEMENT BY PRESIDENT DUVALIER THAT HE WOULD LIQUIDATE THE KIDNAPPERS IF HE COULD GET HIS HANDS ON THEM. \n2.   TO SET THE RECORD STRAIGHT ON THIS POINT,  DUVALIER IN CREOLE ADDRESS JANUARY 26  ( HIS ONLY PUBLIC STATEMENT ON KIDNAPPERS)  SAID IF THEY RETURNED TO HAITI HE WOULD "" BE WAITING FOR THEM WITH A BIG COCOMACAQUE"".   A COCOMACAQUE IS A HEAVY STICK SIMILAR TO AN IRISH SHILLELAGH AND USED FOR THE SAME PURPOSES.   THE INFERENCE WAS CLEARLY THAT THE KIDNAPPERS WOULD BE IN FOR ROUGH HANDLING IF THE GOH COULD GET ITS HANDS ON THEM,  BUT AT NO TIME DID PRESIDENT DUVALIER ANNOUNCE HE WOULD  CONFIDENTIAL         LIQUIDATE OR EXECUTE THEM. \n3.   CORRECT TRANSLATION OF PARTS OF DUVALIER S CREOLE ADDRESS CITED BY MEXICANS ( MEXICO 700)  WOULD READ AS FOLLOWS:   "" I TOOK THAT DECISION ( ON THE KIDNAPPING)  BECAUSE I HAD GOOD REASON FOR IT.   FOR TTOWN MEETING OF ENGLISH- SPEAKING UNIVERSITY HEADS WITH PRIME MINISTER ( CAPE TOWN 223)  HORWOOD EXPRESSED HIS "" WHOLEHEARTED""  APPROVAL OF PRIMIN S STATEMENT AS PER REFTEL.  "" NO UNIVERSITY HAS RIGHT TO BEHAVE IN WAY WHICH DOES NOT CONFORM WITH ACCEPTED NORMS OF COMMUNITY"".  UNIVERSITIES "" SET GREAT STORE BY THEIR AUTONOMY.  THERE IS A CONCOMITANT RESPONSIBILITY TO PUT THEIR OWN HOUSE IN ORDER"". \n3.  COMMENT:  HORWOOD S REMARKS WILL DO NOTHING TO ENDEAR HIM TO UNIVERSITY OF NATAL STUDENTS OR YOUNGER FACULTY MEMBERS,  WHO REMEMBER WITH DISDAIN HIS FEW STORMY YEARS AS PRINCIPAL BEFORE HIS APPOINTMENT TO THE SENATE IN 1970.  HIS STATEMENTS,  INDEED,  MAY LEND FURTHER FUEL TO THE FLAME OF PROTEST IN NATAL AGAINST RECENT NUSAS AND SASO BANNINGS.  HOLMES\n",741828

MINERS IN CATAVI AND SIGLO DECLARED A 48-HOUR STRIKE FEBRUARY 1 TO PROTEST THE LACK OF BASIC FOODS IN THE COMIBOL COMMISSARIES. LEADERS OF THESE UNIONS ALSO ATTACKED THE MINERS FEDERATION (FSTMB) FOR SIGNING WAGE SETTLEMENTS WITH COMIBOL (LA PAZ 613) DESCRIBING THE 25 PERCENT WAGE INCREASE AS INSUFFICIENT.\n2. FSTMB LEADERS EXPLAINED IN CONFIDENCE TO LABATT THAT LEADERS FROM CATAVI, SIGLO XX AND SAN JOSE HAD OPPOSED THE SETTLEMENT BUT WERE VOTED DOWN BY A MAJORITY OF DELEGATES FROM THE ENTIRE NATIONALIZED MINING SECTOR.\n3. FSTMB LEADERS ASCRIBE OPPOSITION TO THE SETTLEMENT AND THE CURRENT STRIKES TO DIFFERENCES IN POLITICAL STRATEGY BETWEEN THEM- SELVES AND FAR LEFT LEADERSHIP (TROTSKYITE, PEKING) IN THE MINES MENTIONED. FAR LEFTISTS BELIEVE THAT BANZERS DAYS ARE NUMBERED AND THAT NOW IS THE TIME TO MAXIMIZE PRESSURE ON HIM. FSTMS LEADERS BELIEVE THAT WHILE BANZER MAY BE SHAKY, THERE IS NO CHANCE OF DRIVING THE MILITARY FROM POWER. THE FSTMB BELIEVES CONFIDENTIAL THAT IF BANZER WERE OUSTED, HE WOULD BE REPLACED BY SOME OTHER OFFICER AND THE CHANCES ARE THAT THAT OFFICER WOULD BE ""EVEN WORSE THAN BANZER"" FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF THE WORKING CLASS. THE FSTMB THEREFORE PREFERS TO SIT OUT THE CURRENT WAVE OF TENSIONS AND AVOID GIVING ANYONE AN EXCUSE TO CLOSE DOWN THE FEDERATION. AS TIME HAS PASSED, FSTMB LEADERS FEEL BANZERS CHANCES OF SURVIVAL HAVE IMPROVED SIGNIFICANTLY AND THAT THE FSTMB STRATEGY HAS BEEN VINDICATED.\n4. COMMENT: THE UNIONS IN CATAVI, SIGLO XX AND SAN JOSE REPRESENT A SIGNIFICANT MINORITY OF THE FSTMB. THEIR DEFIANCE REPRESENTS AN IMPORTANT CHALLENGE TO SECCRETARY GENERAL VICTOR LOPEZ AND HIS POLICY OF DEEMPHASIZING THE POLITICAL ACTIVITIES OF THE FSTMB IN FAVOR OF OBTAINING IMPROVED WAGES AND WORKING CONDITIONS FOR THE MINERS.

EMBASSY NOTES THAT MEXICAN FOREIGN SECRETARY RABASA AND AMBASSADOR TO THE U. S.  DE OLLOQUI HAVE BOTH CITED AS ONE REASON FOR NOT EXTRADITING KNOX KIDNAPPERS TO HAITI AN ALLEGED ANNOUNCEMENT BY PRESIDENT DUVALIER THAT HE WOULD LIQUIDATE THE KIDNAPPERS IF HE COULD GET HIS HANDS ON THEM. \n2.   TO SET THE RECORD STRAIGHT ON THIS POINT,  DUVALIER IN CREOLE ADDRESS JANUARY 26  ( HIS ONLY PUBLIC STATEMENT ON KIDNAPPERS)  SAID IF THEY RETURNED TO HAITI HE WOULD "" BE WAITING FOR THEM WITH A BIG COCOMACAQUE"".   A COCOMACAQUE IS A HEAVY STICK SIMILAR TO AN IRISH SHILLELAGH AND USED FOR THE SAME PURPOSES.   THE INFERENCE WAS CLEARLY THAT THE KIDNAPPERS WOULD BE IN FOR ROUGH HANDLING IF THE GOH COULD GET ITS HANDS ON THEM,  BUT AT NO TIME DID PRESIDENT DUVALIER ANNOUNCE HE WOULD  CONFIDENTIAL         LIQUIDATE OR EXECUTE THEM. \n3.   CORRECT TRANSLATION OF PARTS OF DUVALIER S CREOLE ADDRESS CITED BY MEXICANS ( MEXICO 700)  WOULD READ AS FOLLOWS:   "" I TOOK THAT DECISION ( ON THE KIDNAPPING)  BECAUSE I HAD GOOD REASON FOR IT.   FOR TTOWN MEETING OF ENGLISH- SPEAKING UNIVERSITY HEADS WITH PRIME MINISTER ( CAPE TOWN 223)  HORWOOD EXPRESSED HIS "" WHOLEHEARTED""  APPROVAL OF PRIMIN S STATEMENT AS PER REFTEL.

NEUMANN,frus1969-76ve08d2,"1. SUMMARY. AGOSTINHO NETO ASKED JOAQUIM PINTO DE ANDRADE TO PARTICIPATE IN THE TRANSITIONAL GOVERNMENT. ANDRADE AND OTHER MEMBERS OF THE ""REVOLTA ACTIVA"" HAVE REFUSED TO COOPERATE WITH NETO UNLESS HE AGREES TO ACCEPT THEM AS A LEGITIMATE CURRENTO OF OPINION WITHIN THE PARTY. END SUMMARY.\n2. AFTER THE LUSAKA CONGRESS OF THE MPLA IN AUGUST OF 1974, NETO HELD AN INTERREGIONAL CONGRESS IN EASTERN ANGOLA IN SEPTEMBER, WHERE HE GATHERED TOGETHER LOYALISTS AND SET UP A NEW CENTRAL COMMITTEE. ASIDE FROM LUCIO LARA, NONE OF THE MEMBERS HAS MUCH REPUTATION OR EXPERIENCE. NO ONE DOUBTS LARS INTELLIGENCE, BUT HE IS SUPPOSED TO BE FLAWED BY A DEEP BITTERNESS AND A TERRIBLE DESIRE FOR REVENGE AGAINST WHITES. LOPO DE NASCIMENTO, THE MPLA MEMBER OF THE PRESIDENTIAL COUNCIL IS THOUGHT OF AS A PLEASANT YOUNG MAN, BUT HE HAS NOT STATURE, NO EXPERIENCE AND LITTLE INCLINATION TO STAND UP TO ANYBODY AT THIS POINT. CONFIDENTIAL ERMINIO ESCORCIO, ANOTHER MEMBER OF NETOS INNER GROUP IS DISMISSED BY SOME WHO KNOW HIM AS AN IMBECILE. NETO REALIZES THAT HS IS IN REAL TROUBLE FOR LACK OF GOOD PEOPLE AND IS TRYING TO INDUCE THE ANDRADE FACTION TO TAKE AN ACTIVE PART IN POLITICS.\n3. AS I HAVE PIECED TOGETHER THE STORY, NETO PASSED THE WORD TO JOAQUIM PINTO DE ANDRADE BEFORE OR DURING THE ALVOR CONFERENCE THAT HE WANTED HIM IN THE TRANSITIONAL GOVERNMENT, PROBABLY AS THE MPLA MEMBER OF THE PRESIDENTIAL COUNCIL, OR COLLEGIUM. ANDRADE SENT BACK WORD THAT HE WOULD ACCEPT ON THE CONDITION THAT THE ""REVOLTA ACTIVA"", OR ANDRADE FACTION, BE LEGITIMATIZED WITHIN THE PARTY AND THAT ITS VIEWS AND OPINIONS HAVE WEIGHT IN PARTY COUNCILS. NETO REFUSED AND WENT AHEAD WITH THE SELECTION OF THE PEOPLE NOW IN THE GOVERNMENT.\n4. A FEW DAYS AFTER HIS ARRIVAL IN LUANDA, NETO GRASPED THAT THINGS WERE NOT GOING WELL FOR MPLA AND HE CALLED SOME OLD FRIENDS AMONG THE REVOLTA ACTIVA AND ASKED TO TALK WITH THEM. THEY ALL REFUSED AND TOLD HIM TO TALK WITH ANDRADE. NETO THEN ARRANGED TO MEET WITH ANDRADE WHO BY THIS TIME HAD RETURNED TO LUANDA. NETO REITERATED HIS REQUEST THAT JOAQUIM PARTICIPATE. ANDRADE AGREED, BUT REITERATED HIS DEMAND THAT THE ENTIRE FACTION AND ITS OPINIONS BE ACCEPTED AND ADDED A FEW OTHERS.\n5. ANDRADE AND NETO AGREED TO NOMINATE DELEGATES TO NEGOTIATE A FORMULA ACCEPTABLE TO BOTH SIDES. THE ANDRADE FACTION HAS THREE PRINCIPAL DEMANDS: 1) EASE OUT LARA AND ESCORCIO; THEY NEED NOT NECESSARILY BE THROWN OUT OF THE PARTY, BUT THEY MUST BE PUT SOMEWHERE WHERE THEY WILL NOT HAVE MAJOR RESPONSIBILITIES;\n6. THE IMPLICATIONS TO MPLA OF THE NEGOTIATIONS ARE GREAT. NETO HAS NOBODY WITH ANY PRESTIGE OR CAPABILITY AND THE PARTY NEEDS THE ANDRADE FACTION IF MPLA IS TO HAVE A CHANCE AGAINST THE WELL ORGANIZED UNITA DRIVE FOR VOTES AND THE GROWING ACCEPTANCE OF FNLA AMONG BOTH BLACKS AND WHITES. THE ANDRADE PEOPLE HAVE NO CONFIDENTIAL INTENTION OF LEAVING THE PARTY APPARATUS IN THE HANDS OF NETO IF THEY CAN HELP IT. THEY HOPE TO BE ABLE TO REMOVE HIM FROM THE CENTER AND RELEGATE HIM TO THE ROLE OF PARTY HERO AND ELDER STATESMAN. I HAVE REAL DOUBTS THAT THE ANDRADE FACTION CAN TAKE AWAY FROM NETO ALL THE LEVERS OF POWER. THEY HAVE NOT SHOWN MUCH STOMACH FOR POLITICAL INFIGHTING, WHILE NETO WILL STOP AT NOTHING TO RETAIN POWER. ANDRADE AND COMPANY DO HAVE A USEFUL WEAPON - DENIAL - NOW THAT NETO SEES HIS PRESENT CADRE IS NOT UP TO THE JOB THAT MUST BE DONE. IT IS A SAD COMMENTARY ON NETOS LEADERSHIP THAT MPLA, WHICH WAS TOUTED AS HAVING THE BEST TALENT AND THE GREATEST DEPTH AMONG THE LIBERATION MOVEMENTS NOT ONLY IS THE WEAKEST GROUP IN THE GOVERNMENT, IT HAS THE REPUTATION OF A GANG OF TOUGHS.

   acceptance US offer would make difficult refusal of Soviet offers4 General Attygalle suggested to Jayasinghe that American Ambassador be                            so informed in order clarify grounds for rejection Director General                            Foreign Affairs Vernon Mendis then called into meeting and said Prime                            Minister had considered this as she

   concerned that her effort to support US at UN on terrorism issue had QUOTE backfired UNQUOTE and did                            not want decision on military training to give more concern She had

               General that latter could informally and confidentially convey above                            information to DATT5 During Army Commanders discussion he was also told PM had no rpt no

around search for acceptable alternatives that would allow US training                            without forcing PM to take Soviet                            training as well These included paying for training  too expensive                            paying for only one or two courses  unacceptable to SLAF and asking                                USG to provide under nonmilitary

Soviet                            fisheries agreement and for permission send officers of both ministries                            to USSR for training PM Attygalle said has been adverse to                            training Ceylonese in Soviet Union and thus far has withstood pressure                            by citing Sri Lankas nonalignment policy She allegedly feels                            acceptance US offer would make difficult refusal of Soviet offers4 General Attygalle suggested to Jayasinghe that American Ambassador be                            so informed in order clarify grounds for rejection Director General                            Foreign Affairs Vernon Mendis then called into meeting and said Prime                            Minister had considered this as she did not rpt not want her effort to                                improve GSLUS relations to be affected According                            Attygalle Mendis went on to say PM                            concerned that her effort to support US at UN on terrorism issue had QUOTE backfired UNQUOTE and did                            not want decision on military training to give more concern She had                            decided however it would be unwise to reveal officially to Ambassador                            extent of internal Cabinet difficulties Mendis then allegedly told                            General that latter could informally and confidentially convey above                            information to DATT5 During Army Commanders discussion he was also told PM had no rpt no objection to US military                            training team coming to Sri Lanka as USSR and SRC had had teams here to assist with equipment                            given after 1971 insurgency6 COMMENT: Adverse decision appears reflect PMs continuing suspicion of Soviet motives and activities                            in Sri Lanka and should not be interpreted as change in her attitude                            toward US Air Commodore Paddy Mendis explained to DATT that extended                            discussions between MDFA and PM centered                            around search for acceptable alternatives that would allow US training                            without forcing PM to take Soviet                            training as well These included paying for training  too expensive                            paying for only one or two courses  unacceptable to SLAF and asking                                USG to provide under nonmilitary                            label infeasible With none of alternatives acceptable decision made                            to postpone issue7 Sri Lanka currently authorized CONUS training only Mission believes

              consonance current policy lowvisibility nor would it provide desired                            exposure to US concepts envisaged in CONUS program Recommend however                            US keep open opportunity for modest CONUS program should PM feel such training could be acceptable in                            next year or so Meanwhile Sri Lanka armed forces personnel some

SUMMARY. AGOSTINHO NETO ASKED JOAQUIM PINTO DE ANDRADE TO PARTICIPATE IN THE TRANSITIONAL GOVERNMENT. ANDRADE AND OTHER MEMBERS OF THE ""REVOLTA ACTIVA"" HAVE REFUSED TO COOPERATE WITH NETO UNLESS HE AGREES TO ACCEPT THEM AS A LEGITIMATE CURRENTO OF OPINION WITHIN THE PARTY. END SUMMARY.\n2. AFTER THE LUSAKA CONGRESS OF THE MPLA IN AUGUST OF 1974, NETO HELD AN INTERREGIONAL CONGRESS IN EASTERN ANGOLA IN SEPTEMBER, WHERE HE GATHERED TOGETHER LOYALISTS AND SET UP A NEW CENTRAL COMMITTEE. ASIDE FROM LUCIO LARA, NONE OF THE MEMBERS HAS MUCH REPUTATION OR EXPERIENCE. NO ONE DOUBTS LARS INTELLIGENCE, BUT HE IS SUPPOSED TO BE FLAWED BY A DEEP BITTERNESS AND A TERRIBLE DESIRE FOR REVENGE AGAINST WHITES. LOPO DE NASCIMENTO, THE MPLA MEMBER OF THE PRESIDENTIAL COUNCIL IS THOUGHT OF AS A PLEASANT YOUNG MAN, BUT HE HAS NOT STATURE, NO EXPERIENCE AND LITTLE INCLINATION TO STAND UP TO ANYBODY AT THIS POINT. CONFIDENTIAL ERMINIO ESCORCIO, ANOTHER MEMBER OF NETOS INNER GROUP IS DISMISSED BY SOME WHO KNOW HIM AS AN IMBECILE. NETO REALIZES THAT HS IS IN REAL TROUBLE FOR LACK OF GOOD PEOPLE AND IS TRYING TO INDUCE THE ANDRADE FACTION TO TAKE AN ACTIVE PART IN POLITICS.\n3. AS I HAVE PIECED TOGETHER THE STORY, NETO PASSED THE WORD TO JOAQUIM PINTO DE ANDRADE BEFORE OR DURING THE ALVOR CONFERENCE THAT HE WANTED HIM IN THE TRANSITIONAL GOVERNMENT, PROBABLY AS THE MPLA MEMBER OF THE PRESIDENTIAL COUNCIL, OR COLLEGIUM. ANDRADE SENT BACK WORD THAT HE WOULD ACCEPT ON THE CONDITION THAT THE ""REVOLTA ACTIVA"", OR ANDRADE FACTION, BE LEGITIMATIZED WITHIN THE PARTY AND THAT ITS VIEWS AND OPINIONS HAVE WEIGHT IN PARTY COUNCILS. NETO REFUSED AND WENT AHEAD WITH THE SELECTION OF THE PEOPLE NOW IN THE GOVERNMENT.\n4. A FEW DAYS AFTER HIS ARRIVAL IN LUANDA, NETO GRASPED THAT THINGS WERE NOT GOING WELL FOR MPLA AND HE CALLED SOME OLD FRIENDS AMONG THE REVOLTA ACTIVA AND ASKED TO TALK WITH THEM. THEY ALL REFUSED AND TOLD HIM TO TALK WITH ANDRADE. NETO THEN ARRANGED TO MEET WITH ANDRADE WHO BY THIS TIME HAD RETURNED TO LUANDA. NETO REITERATED HIS REQUEST THAT JOAQUIM PARTICIPATE. ANDRADE AGREED, BUT REITERATED HIS DEMAND THAT THE ENTIRE FACTION AND ITS OPINIONS BE ACCEPTED AND ADDED A FEW OTHERS.\n5. ANDRADE AND NETO AGREED TO NOMINATE DELEGATES TO NEGOTIATE A FORMULA ACCEPTABLE TO BOTH SIDES. THE ANDRADE FACTION HAS THREE PRINCIPAL DEMANDS: 1) EASE OUT LARA AND ESCORCIO; THEY NEED NOT NECESSARILY BE THROWN OUT OF THE PARTY, BUT THEY MUST BE PUT SOMEWHERE WHERE THEY WILL NOT HAVE MAJOR RESPONSIBILITIES;\n6. THE IMPLICATIONS TO MPLA OF THE NEGOTIATIONS ARE GREAT. NETO HAS NOBODY WITH ANY PRESTIGE OR CAPABILITY AND THE PARTY NEEDS THE ANDRADE FACTION IF MPLA IS TO HAVE A CHANCE AGAINST THE WELL ORGANIZED UNITA DRIVE FOR VOTES AND THE GROWING ACCEPTANCE OF FNLA AMONG BOTH BLACKS AND WHITES. THE ANDRADE PEOPLE HAVE NO CONFIDENTIAL INTENTION OF LEAVING THE PARTY APPARATUS IN THE HANDS OF NETO IF THEY CAN HELP IT. THEY HOPE TO BE ABLE TO REMOVE HIM FROM THE CENTER AND RELEGATE HIM TO THE ROLE OF PARTY HERO AND ELDER STATESMAN. I HAVE REAL DOUBTS THAT THE ANDRADE FACTION CAN TAKE AWAY FROM NETO ALL THE LEVERS OF POWER. THEY HAVE NOT SHOWN MUCH STOMACH FOR POLITICAL INFIGHTING, WHILE NETO WILL STOP AT NOTHING TO RETAIN POWER. ANDRADE AND COMPANY DO HAVE A USEFUL WEAPON - DENIAL - NOW THAT NETO SEES HIS PRESENT CADRE IS NOT UP TO THE JOB THAT MUST BE DONE. IT IS A SAD COMMENTARY ON NETOS LEADERSHIP THAT MPLA, WHICH WAS TOUTED AS HAVING THE BEST TALENT AND THE GREATEST DEPTH AMONG THE LIBERATION MOVEMENTS NOT ONLY IS THE WEAKEST GROUP IN THE GOVERNMENT, IT HAS THE REPUTATION OF A GANG OF TOUGHS.
