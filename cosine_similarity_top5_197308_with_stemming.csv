0,0.9821062769248657,2625 Subject: Egyptian Perceptions of US Motives in Middle East1 My contacts with Egyptians at various levels since USG veto of Security Council resolution on                        MidEast on July 26See Document 80 and footnote 5 thereto have led me to                        conclude that GOE thinking has now                        crystallized on following theory to explain USG intentions and actions in Middle East:2 Egyptian officials believe that USG has                        concluded that its interests in area can be best served by arming Israel and                        Iran as military surrogates and keeping Arabs particularly Egypt weak and                        divided Iranian military power can                        be used if necessary to preserve US oil                        interests in Persian Gulf Israelis are being strengthened so that they can                        continue to occupy Egyptian territory dissipate Egyptian energies force                        Egypt to direct scarce economic resources to defense budget and distract                            GOE from possible antiUS role in the                        area by keeping it preoccupied with Israeli aggression USG strategy is thus viewed by Egyptians as                        effort to block peace efforts and keep Israeli boots on Egyptian necks in                        order to distract Egypt from possible future moves against US interests                        To further this objective USG is also                        attempting to promote internal division within Egypt and is taking steps to                        weaken Egypt economically Latest example cited to us by several official                        Egyptians is cancellation of USG                        participation in FAO program for school                        lunches in rural area of Egypt State 156142Not found3 Even the more sophisticated Egyptians have decided this theory is only                        reasonable explanation of USG veto and                        continued heavy US economic political and military support for Israel                        If USG means what it says about achieving a                        political settlement it would be relatively easy they reason for USG to apply enough pressure on Israel                        through US control of Israels economic and military lifelines to bring                        about more flexibility in Israels negotiating posture Fact that we have                        not done so can only mean that USG is not                        interested in a settlement but is interested in curbing Egyptian power                        through use of Israel as chosen instrument4 USG condemnation of Israel on UNSC airliner diversion resolution is                        considered window dressing because USG                        refused to consider sanctions that would have put teeth into Security                        Council condemnation and made it something more than a verbal exerciseOn August 15 the UN Security Council unanimously adopted Resolution 337                            1973 which condemned the Israeli Government for the forcible                            diversion and seizure by the Israeli Air Force of a Lebanese airliner                            from Lebanons air space The Council called on the International Civil                            Aviation Organization to take account of the resolution when considering                            measures to safeguard international civil aviation against these                            actions and called on Israel to desist from all acts that violated                            Lebanons sovereignty and territorial integrity and

             pressure on Israel GOE will probably react                        to this perception of USG intentions by                        intensifying its efforts to lash out against US interests Effort is now                        apparently under way to solicit cooperation of Saudi Arabia and Gulf States                        in applying pressure on US oil interests and utilizing Arab financial                        reserves in ways that would undercut US international monetary objectives                        Fortunately for US Egyptian need for Saudi economic support has given                        Saudis the upper hand in negotiating with Sadat and has apparently enabled Faisal                        to moderate Sadats inclination to strike out at United                        States economic interests In order to bring about a rapprochement with                            Faisal Sadat has had to agree to go along with                            Faisals more moderate approach                        to the use of oil as a political weapon The Saudis have apparently                        intervened with Sadat on behalf of                        the American proposal on SUMED and we                        have received reports that Sadat has                        agreed to support Faisals oil                        diplomacy at the upcoming Arab meetings at Algiers6 On more parochial issues such as American cultural interests in Egypt and                            USINTs freedom of action the Saudis                        will have little interest and we may be in for some difficult days                        aheadWiley,frus1969-76v25d85,"1.  MY CONTACTS WITH EGYPTIANS AT VARIOUS LEVELS SINCE USG VETO OF SECURITY COUNCIL RESOLUTION ON MID-EAST ON JULY 26 HAVE LED ME TO CONCLUDE THAT GOE THINKING HAS NOW CRYSTALLIZED ON FOLLOWING THEORY TO EXPLAIN USG INTENTIONS AND ACTIONS IN MIDDLE EAST:\n2.  EGYPTIAN OFFICIALS BELIEVE THAT USG HAS CONCLUDED THAT ITS INTERESTS IN AREA CAN BE BEST SERVED BY ARMING ISRAEL AND IRAN AS MILITARY SURROGATES AND KEEPING ARABS, PARTICULARLY EGYPT, WEAK AND DIVIDED.  IRANIAN MILITARY POWER CAN BE USED, IF NECESSARY, TO PRESERVE US OIL INTERESTS IN PERSIAN GULF.  ISRAELIS ARE BEING STRENGTHENED SO THAT THEY CAN CONTINUE TO OCCUPY EGYPTIAN TERRITORY, DISSIPATE EGYPTIAN ENERGIES, FORCE EGYPT TO DIRECT SCARCE ECONOMIC RESOURCES TO DEFENSE BUDGET, AND    SECRET  DISTRACT GOE FROM POSSIBLE ANTI-US ROLE IN THE AREA BY KEEPING IT PREOCCUPIED WITH ISRAELI AGGRESSION.  USG STRATEGY IS THUS VIEWED BY EGYPTIANS AS EFFORT TO BLOCK PEACE EFFORTS AND KEEP ISRAELI BOOTS ON EGYPTIAN NECKS IN ORDER TO DISTRACT EGYPT FROM POSSIBLE FUTURE MOVES AGAINST US INTERESTS.  TO FURTHER THIS OBJECTIVE, USG IS ALSO ATTEMPTING TO PROMOTE INTERNAL DIVISION WITHIN EGYPT AND IS TAKING STEPS TO WEAKEN EGYPT ECONOMI- CALLY.  LATEST EXAMPLE CITED TO US BY SEVERAL OFFICIAL EGYPTIANS IS CANCELLATION OF USG PARTICIPATION IN FAO PROGRAM FOR SCHOOL LUNCHES IN RURAL AREA OF EGYPT (STATE 156142).\n3.  EVEN THE MORE SOPHISTICATED EGYPTIANS HAVE DECIDED THIS THEORY IS ONLY REASONABLE EXPLANATION OF USG VETO AND CONTINUED HEAVY US ECONOMIC, POLITICAL, AND MILITARY SUPPORT FOR ISRAEL.  IF USG MEANS WHAT IT SAYS ABOUT ACHIEVING A POLITICAL SETTLEMENT, IT WOULD BE RELATIVELY EASY, THEY REASON, FOR USG TO APPLY ENOUGH PRESSURE ON ISRAEL, THROUGH US CONTROL OF ISRAELS ECONOMIC AND MILITARY LIFELINES, TO BRING ABOUT MORE FLEXIBILITY IN ISRAELS NEGOTIATING POSTURE.  FACT THAT WE HAVE NOT DONE SO CAN ONLY MEAN THAT USG IS NOT INTERESTED IN A SETTLEMENT, BUT IS INTERESTED IN CURBING EGYPTIAN POWER THROUGH USE OF ISRAEL AS CHOSEN INSTRUMENT.\n4.  USG CONDEMNATION OF ISRAEL ON UNSC AIRLINER DIVER- SION RESOLUTION IS CONSIDERED WINDOW DRESSING, BECASUSE USG REFUSED TO CONSIDER SANCTIONS THAT WOULD HAVE PUT TEETH INTO SECURITY COUNCIL CONDEMNATION AND MADE IT SOMETHING MORE THAN A VERBAL EXERCISE.\n5.  IN ABSENCE OF ANY INDICATION OF USG PRESSURE ON ISRAEL, GOE WILL PROBABLY REACT TO THIS PERCEPTION OF USG INTENTIONS BY INTENSIFYING ITS EFFORTS TO LASH OUT AGAINST US INTERESTS.  EFFORT IS NOW APPARENTLY UNDER WAY TO SOLICIT COOPERATION OF SAUDI ARABIA AND GULF STATES IN APPLYING PRESSURE ON US OIL INTERESTS AND UTILIZING ARAB FINANCIAL RESERVES IN WAYS THAT WOULD UNDERCUT US INTERNATIONAL MONETARY OBJECTIVES.  FORTUNATELY FOR US, EGYPTIAN NEED FOR SAUDI ECONOMIC SUPPORT HAS    SECRET  GIVEN SAUDIS THE UPPER HAND IN NEGOTIATING WITH SADAT AND HAS APPARENTLY ENABLED FAISAL TO MODERATE SADATS INCLINATION TO STRIKE OUT AT UNITED STATES ECONOMIC INTERESTS.  IN ORDER TO BRING ABOUT A RAPPROCHEMENT WITH FAISAL, SADAT HAS HAD TO AGREE TO GO ALONG WITH FAISALS MORE MODERATE APPROACH TO THE USE OF OIL AS A POLITICAL WEAPON.  THE SAUDIS HAVE APPARENTLY INTERVENED WITH SADAT ON BEHALF OF THE AMERICAN PROPOSAL ON SUMED AND WE HAVE RECEIVED REPORTS THAT SADAT HAS AGREED TO SUPPORT FAISALS OIL DIPLOMACY AT THE UPCOMING ARAB MEETINGS AT ALGIERS.\n6.  ON MORE PAROCHIAL ISSUES, SUCH AS AMERICAN CULTURAL INTERESTS IN EGYPT AND USINTS FREEDOM OF ACTION, THE SAUDIS WILL HAVE LITTLE INTEREST, AND WE MAY BE IN FOR SOME DIFFICULT DAYS AHEAD.

and we may be in for some difficult days                        aheadWiley,frus1969-76v25d85,"1.  IN TOUR DHORIZON AUGUST 7 QUAI ACTING DIRECTOR MIDDLE EAST AFFAIRS ROUILLON AALYSED CURRENT SITUATION IN AREA AND COMMENTED ON IMPRESSION HE HAD GAINED FROM RECENT MEETINGS WITH VISITING FOREIGN MINISTERS ZAYYAT OF EGYPT AND SAQQAF OF SAUDI ARABIA.  ROUILLON BEGAN BY NOTING SPATE OF DECLARATION IN US BY MOBIL OIL AND STANDARD OF CALIFORNIA, AND ASSISTANT SECRETARY SISCOS INTERVIEW WITH ISRAELI TELEVISITON.  ARABS, HE SAID, WERE EXTREMELY PLEASED BY THESE STATEMENTS, AND, LIKE FRENCH, HAD BEEN STRUCK BY REPORTS OF SISCO INTERVIEW, PARTICULARLY HIS COMMENT THAT IT WOULD BE ""FOOLHARDY"" TO BELIVE ENERGY QUESTION NOT A FACTOR IN US POLICY. ROUILLON SAID THAT ISRAELIS WERE DISTURBED BY THESE DEVELOPMENTS.  ACCORING TO REPORT FROM FRENCH EMBASSY IN TEL AVIV, ISRAELI OFFICIALS INCREASINGLY DOUBTFUL THAT UNSC RESULT HAD REALLY BEEN SATISFACTORY FROM GOI POINT OF VIEW, EVEN WITH US VETO.  ROUILLON NOTED THAT IN TEL AVIV THERE WAS INCREASING EMPHASIS ON REASONABLENESS OF SADAT AND HIS ADMINISTRATION.\n2.  EGYPTIANS, ON OTHER HAND, WERE DELIGHTED WITH RESULTS OF UNSC DEBATE, EGYPTIAN POSITION HAD NOT ONLY BEEN ENDORSED BY TRADITIONAL NON-ALIGNED AND EASTERN BLOC FRIENDS, BUT BY LATIN AMERICANS, NATO MEMBERS AND NEUTRALS SUCH AS AUSTRIA WHILE EGYPTIANS WOULD HAVE PREFERRED TO HAVE US SUPPORT OR ABSTENTION, THEY ARE CONFIDENT THAT THEY NOW HAVE VIRTUALLY UNANIMOUS INTERNATIONAL ACCEPTANCE FOR THEIR INTERPRETATION OF UN RESOLUTION 242.  SPEAKING PERSONALLY WITH ROUILLON SAID THAT US VETO HAD BEEN USEFUL IN MAINTAINING EGYPTIAN UNCERTAINTIES ABOUT FUTURE COURSE OF US POLICY, AT TIME WHEN EGYPTIANS ALSO UNCERTAIN ABOUT DEGREE TO WHICH THEY COULD COUNT ON RUSSIAN SUPPORT.\n3.  EMBOFF AGREED THAT ISRAELIS WERE UNEASY AND THAT THERE WERE SOME SIGNS OF MORE NUANCED ISRAELI POSITIONS AS EVIDENCED FOR EXAMPLE BY EBAN INTERVIEW WITH NOUVEL OBSERVATEUR (PARIS 21272 NOTAL).  ROUILLON SPECULATED ABOUT POSSIBLE EVOLUTION ISRAELI POSITION ON EGYPTIAN SOVEREIGNTY IN SINAI.  ROUILLON SAID THAT ISRAELI ACKNOWLEDGEMENT OF EGYPTIAN SOVEREIGNTY WOULD INDEED BE FORWARD STEP.  HOWEVER IT WOULD REQUIRE CLEAR STATEMENT FROM AUTHORITIVE ISRAELI CONFIDENTIAL GOVERNMENT SOURCE, EITHER CABINET OR PARLIAMENT IN ORDER TO BE CREDIBLE, GIVEN PROPENSITY OF ISRAELI OFFICIALS TO CONTRA- DICT EACH OTHER IN TALKING ABOUT SETTLEMENT TERMS.  EVEN SO, AS LONG AS GOI CONTINUED TO INIST ON ISRAELI MILITARY PRESENCE AT SHARM EL SHEIKH, HE THOUGHT ARABS WOULD NOT ACCEPT.  ON OTHER HAND HE WAS ABSOLUTELY CERTAIN THAT IF ISRAELIS COULD ACCEPT CONTROL THROUGH UN OR OTHER THIRD PARTIES, NEGOTIATIONS COULD BEGIN ALMOST AT ONCE.\n4.  CONVERSATION TURNED BRIEFLY TO QUESTION OF PALESTINIANS.  IN RESPONSE TO EARLIER ROULLON QUESTION ABOUT SIGNIFICANCE OF REFERENCE TO ""LEGITIMATE PALESTINIAN INTERESTS"" IN NIXON-BREZHNEV COMMUNIQUE, EMBOFF EXPLAINED DISTINCTION WHICH USG DREW BETWEEN PALESTINIAN RIGHTS AND INTERESTS, LATTER OF WHICH RULES OUT EXTREME PALESTINIAN POSITION DEMANDING ELIMINATION OF ISRAEL.  ROUILLON SAID THAT GOF MADE NO DISTINCTION BETWEEN RIGHTS AND INTERESTS. FRENCH WILLING TO USE FORMULATION ""PALESTINIAN RIGHTS"" WITHOUT IMPLYING GOF ENDORSEMENT OF ANY PARTICULAR PALESTINIAN TERRITORIAL CLAIM OR SOLUTION OF PALESTINIAN PROBLEM.\n6.  ON WALDHEIM MISSION ROUILLON SAID FRENCH CONTINUED TO BELIEVE THAT IT WOULD ACHIEVE NOTHING, EXCEPT GAIN TIME. THAT, HOWEVER, WAS USEFUL IN ITSELF SINCE IT WAS UN- REALISTIC TO EXPECT ANY PROGRESS ON SUBSTANCE BEFORE ISRAELI ELECTIONS.  THEREAFTER ARABS AND OTHERS WOULD BE LOOKING TO SEE WHAT US MIGHT DO.  ROUILLON SAID GOF UNDERSTOOD USG POSITION THAT SECURITY COUNCIL VEO DESIGNED TO PRESERVE POSSIBILITY OF NEGOTIATION PROCESS. OBVIOUSLY ARABS SCEPTICAL, BUT GOF DID NOT QUESTION US GOOD INTENTIONS, HOPED THAT USG WOULD CONTINUE TO WORK FOR SETTLEMENT AND WERE IMPRESSED BY RECENT SIGNS (I.E. SISCO INTERVIEWS) THAT USG MIGHT BE ATTEMPTING TO NUDGE ISRAELIS FORWARD. STONE\n",614430
3,0.6438306527153418,2625 Subject: Egyptian Perceptions of US Motives in Middle East1 My contacts with Egyptians at various levels since USG veto of Security Council resolution on                        MidEast on July 26See Document 80 and footnote 5 thereto have led me to                        conclude that GOE thinking has now                        crystallized on following theory to explain USG intentions and actions in Middle East:2 Egyptian officials believe that USG has                        concluded that its interests in area can be best served by arming Israel and                        Iran as military surrogates and keeping Arabs particularly Egypt weak and                        divided Iranian military power can                        be used if necessary to preserve US oil                        interests in Persian Gulf Israelis are being strengthened so that they can                        continue to occupy Egyptian territory dissipate Egyptian energies force                        Egypt to direct scarce economic resources to defense budget and distract                            GOE from possible antiUS role in the                        area by keeping it preoccupied with Israeli aggression USG strategy is thus viewed by Egyptians as                        effort to block peace efforts and keep Israeli boots on Egyptian necks in                        order to distract Egypt from possible future moves against US interests                        To further this objective USG is also                        attempting to promote internal division within Egypt and is taking steps to                        weaken Egypt economically Latest example cited to us by several official                        Egyptians is cancellation of USG                        participation in FAO program for school                        lunches in rural area of Egypt State 156142Not found3 Even the more sophisticated Egyptians have decided this theory is only                        reasonable explanation of USG veto and                        continued heavy US economic political and military support for Israel                        If USG means what it says about achieving a                        political settlement it would be relatively easy they reason for USG to apply enough pressure on Israel                        through US control of Israels economic and military lifelines to bring                        about more flexibility in Israels negotiating posture Fact that we have                        not done so can only mean that USG is not                        interested in a settlement but is interested in curbing Egyptian power                        through use of Israel as chosen instrument4 USG condemnation of Israel on UNSC airliner diversion resolution is                        considered window dressing because USG                        refused to consider sanctions that would have put teeth into Security                        Council condemnation and made it something more than a verbal exerciseOn August 15 the UN Security Council unanimously adopted Resolution 337                            1973 which condemned the Israeli Government for the forcible                            diversion and seizure by the Israeli Air Force of a Lebanese airliner                            from Lebanons air space The Council called on the International Civil                            Aviation Organization to take account of the resolution when considering                            measures to safeguard international civil aviation against these                            actions and called on Israel to desist from all acts that violated                            Lebanons sovereignty and territorial integrity and

             pressure on Israel GOE will probably react                        to this perception of USG intentions by                        intensifying its efforts to lash out against US interests Effort is now                        apparently under way to solicit cooperation of Saudi Arabia and Gulf States                        in applying pressure on US oil interests and utilizing Arab financial                        reserves in ways that would undercut US international monetary objectives                        Fortunately for US Egyptian need for Saudi economic support has given                        Saudis the upper hand in negotiating with Sadat and has apparently enabled Faisal                        to moderate Sadats inclination to strike out at United                        States economic interests In order to bring about a rapprochement with                            Faisal Sadat has had to agree to go along with                            Faisals more moderate approach                        to the use of oil as a political weapon The Saudis have apparently                        intervened with Sadat on behalf of                        the American proposal on SUMED and we                        have received reports that Sadat has                        agreed to support Faisals oil                        diplomacy at the upcoming Arab meetings

UPON MY RETURN TO TEHRAN I REVIEWED AS A MATTER OF URGENCY COMMODITY SITUATION INCLUDING WHAT HAS BEEN PASSED TO THE IRANIANS (AMBASSADOR ZAHEDI AND BANK OMRAN, REF A) ON OUTLOOK FOR COMMODITY SALES UNDER PL-480 AND CCC. IN LIGHT OF CONVERSATIONS I HELD IN WASHINGTON ON MY RECENT VISIT, I CONCLUDE PRESENT SITUATION AS REFLECTED IN REFTELS COULD HAVE ALMOST DISASTROUS EFFECTS ON IRANIAN FOOD SITUATION AND POLICY, AS WELL AS ON OUR RELATIONS WITH IRAN. OUTLOOK IS EXTREMELY BLEAK AND I BELIEVE WE SHOULD BE AS CANDID AS POSSIBLE WITH THE IRANIANS SO THAT THEY CAN BETTER ADJUST AND DEVISE ALTERNATIVE POLICIES.\n2. IRAN IS HEAVILY DEPENDENT ON US SOURCES FOR GRAIN AND VEGETABLE OIL. IN RECENT YEARS IT HAS BOUGHT FROM US ABOUT 700,000 TONS ANNUALLY WHEAT (MOSTLY WESTERN WHITE) AND 70,000 TONS OF OIL. GOI IS ALREADY SUBSIDIZING BREAD CONFIDENTIAL INDUSTRY TO KEEP PRICE AT LEVEL ACCEPTABLE TO MASSES OF PEOPLE FOR WHOM BREAD IS MAIN SOURCE OF NOURISHMENT. WITH SHARP RISE OF WHEAT PRICES THIS SUBSIDY WILL HAVE TO BE RAISED ACCORDINGLY, ASSUMING WHEAT IS AVAILABLE FOR IMPORT AT WORLD PRICE, IN ORDER PREVENT POPULAR UNREST.\n3. WE ARE ALREADY HEARING STATEMENTS OF CONCERN AND UNHAPPINESS OVER COMMODITY OUTLOOK, SO FAR FROM THOSE DIRECTLY INVOLVED IN PROCUREMENT SUCH AS BANK OMRAN OFFICIALS. WE CAN CONFIDENTLY ANTICIPATE, HOWEVER, THAT LEVEL AT WHICH CONCERN IS EXPRESSED WILL QUICKLY RISE-- EVENTUALLY TO THE TOP.\n4. FACTS OF WORLD COMMODITY SITUATION ARE SUCH THAT THERE IS OBVIOUSLY NO EASY WAY OUT. OUR INABILITY TO SUPPLY COMMODITIES AT PREVIOUS LOW PRICES (AND IN CASE OF SOME OUR INABILITY TO SUPPLY AT ALL) WILL DIS- PLEASE GOI, NO MATTER HOW WE PRESENT FACTS. TO KEEP THIS DISPLEASURE AT LOWEST POSSIBLE PITCH, I BELIEVE THAT I SHOULD BE IN POSITION FRANKLY TO LAY BEFORE GOI, POSSIBLY INCLUDING SHAH, FACTS IN THEIR COLDEST, MOST ACCURATE FORM. I WOULD LIKE TO DO THAT AT EARLIEST POS- SIBLE TIME, GOING TO GOI BEFORE SOME HIGH OFFICIAL CALLS ME IN TO EXPRESS HIS CONCERN. BY DOING THAT I BELIEVE THAT WE MAY FORESTALL CHARGES OF BAD FAITH.\n5. TO BE ABLE TO MAKE THIS APPROACH I NEED (A) IN EASILY USABLE FORM LATEST AND MOST ACCURATE AND COMPLETE FIGURES AVAILABLE ON OUTLOOK FOR COMMODITY SUPPLIES AND PRICES FOR THIS AND NEXT YEAR; (B) WELL REASONED EXPLANATION OF CAUSES OF CURRENT SHORTAGES, AND (C) RATIONALE FOR ANY EXCEPTIONS WE MAY BE MAKING OVER- SEAS WHICH WILL QUICKLY COME TO ATTENTION OF GOI. I WOULD ALSO APPRECIATE BEING INFORMED ABOUT WHAT WE CAN TELL IRANIANS HOW COMMODITY SITUATION IS SHAPING UP NEXT YEAR AND WHAT IRAN MAY REASONABLY EXPECT. HELMS\n",620012

RATTRAY CONSULTED WITH USDA OFFICIALS RE IRANIAN COMMODITY PROCUREMENT SITUATION AUGUST 29.  OMRAN HAS PLACED ORDERS WITH CARGILL AND DREFUS FOR 700,000 MT HARD RED AND WESTERN WHITE WHEAT, AND ANOTHER 117,000 MT WHEAT PRESENTLY IN PIPELINE.  THERE STRONG LIKELIHOOD THAT BOTH CARGILL AND DREFUS CAN FULFILL ABOVE EXPORT COMMITMENTS.  USDA HAS COME OUT AGAINST EXPORT CONTROLS, AND WHEAT PRICES PRESENTLY DRIFTING DOWNWARD ON CHICAGO COMMODITY MARKET. FINAL DETERMINATION ON EXPORT CONTROLS/LICENSING STILL PENDING.\n2.  FEED GRAIN PRODUCTION OUTLOOK EXCELLENT.  OVER 24,000 MT CORN SHIPPED TO IRAN UNDER CCC CREDIT, AND PROVIDED WEATHER CONDITIONS DURING HARVEST PERIOD SATISFACTORY, THERE SHOULD BE AMPLE STOCKS OF CORN AND BARLEY AVAILABLE FOR EXPORT.\n3.  NO DECISION HAS BEEN OFFICIALLY TAKEN RE CONTINUATION EXPORT CONTROLS ON SOYBEANS/SOYBEAN PRODUCTS.  RECORD CROP, HOWEVER, ANTICIPATED.  THIS PROMISING PROSPECT COULD BE CHANGED IF SOYBEAN AND OTHER FOOD AND FEED GRAIN HARVESTS ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY WEATHER.\n4.  RICE STOCKS VERY LOW BUT BUMPER CROPS EXPECTED IN ARKANSAS AND CALIFORNIA, AND SITUATION SHOULD EASE IN EARLY 1974.  IRANIANS MIGHT KEEP THIS IN MIND WHEN PLACING ORDERS FOR THIS COMMODITY.\n5.  COMMENT:  SITUATION DESCRIBED ABOVE BASED ON CURRENT CONDITIONS IN U.S. MARKETS.  SHOULD THESE CHANGE, POSSIBILITY OF FURTHER LIMITATIONS ON COMMODITY EXPORTS CAN NOT BE EXCLUDED.  EMBASSY SHOULD THEREFORE AVOID MAKING DEFINITIVE COMMENTS ON AVAILABILITY OF U.S. COMMODITIES IN COMING CROP YEAR AT THIS TIME.   ROGERS\n",616881

ISRAELI AMBASSADOR DINITZ REQUESTED A MEETING WITH UNDER SECRETARY CASEY ON AUGUST 15 IN ORDER TO PRESENT MEMORANDUM ON ISRAELS ESSENTIAL REQUIREMENTS FOR U.S. AGRICULTURAL COMMODITIES (COPY POUCHED SEPARATELY.) AMB DINITZ EXPLAINED THAT THE GOI PRESUMED THAT THERE MIGHT BE DIFFICULTIES IN THE FUTURE ALLOCATION OF U.S. AGRICULTURAL COMMODITIES.  THE PURPOSE OF PRESENTING THE MEMORANDUM WAS TO REQUEST A FAVORABLE REVIEW AND SPECIAL CONSIDERATION OF THE ISRAEL SITUATION, ESPECIALLY THE IMPORTANT NON-ECONOMIC ASPECTS SUCH AS THE CONTINUED STATE OF SEIGE AND THE PROBLEMS ASSOCIATED WITH SHIPPING TO ISRAEL.  ECONOMIC MINISTER SH ADDED THE MEMORANDUM DID NOT CONSTITUTE THE GOIS PL 480 REQUEST WHICH WOULD BE LIMITED OFFICIAL USE\n2.  UNDER SECRETARY CASEY PROMISED THAT THE MEMORANDUM WOULD BE GIVEN CAREFUL ATTENTION.  THE USG IS PRESENTLY EXAMINING THE COMMODITY SITUATION, BUT NO DETERMINATION CONCERNING AVAILABILITY WILL BE MADE UNTIL THERE IS A CLEARER  PICTURE OF SUPPLY AND DEMAND.  IN RESPONSE TO SHERS EXPRESSION OF FEAR OF A NEW U.S. EXPORT CONTROL POLICY, UNDER SECRETARY CASEY SAID THAT THE U.S. WAS NOT PLANNING TO INTRODUCE EXPORT CONTROLS.  THE DECISION TO AVOID CONTROLS AND TO ALLOW THE PRICE MECHANISM TO ALLOCATE COMMODITIES HAS BEEN MADE BY THE USG, UNLESS PRESENT CROP EXPECTATIONS ARE SERIOUSLY DISAPPOINTED OR FOREIGN DEMANDS BECOME EXCESSIVE.\n3.  UNDER SECRETARY CASEY REGRETTED THAT THE U.S. HAD NOT BEEN ABLE TO ACT FAVORABLY ON ISRAELS REQUEST FOR AN EX- EMPTION TO THE SOYBEAN EXPORT CONTROL POLICY.

neighborsNepal and Sri Lanka  It also                            added a new member Bangladeshto this group  While India is trying to reassure these countries                            by being correct and even generous in its official dealings with them                            it cannot deny either its overwhelming greater strength or its natural                            involvement in their affairs It does not want to incorporate them into                            India but it feels its security interests require that they should                            remain stable and free from Chinese control It prefers to use the                            carrot rather than the stick to achieve this objective But it has                            intervened forcefully in the affairs

together will continue to create tensions between India and its smaller                            neighbors END SUMMARY1 Indian Involvement: Given the close ties between India and most of its                            smaller independently minded neighbors friction is almost inevitable                            All have in common a background of participation in the history of the                            geographic region now dominated by India Presentday links vary but are                            close Nepal is landlocked with its only economic access to the rest of                            the world across India Most of its trade is with India Both it and                            Bangladesh have long sievelike borders with India The evolving ties                            between India and Bangladesh reflect India s key role in the  liberation of Bangladesh and its                            postwar assistance to the new a country Various forms of Indian aid                            already spent or programmed total about 330 million trade relations                            are being developed and Bengalis on both sides of the border share a                            common cultural heritage In the case of Sri Lanka the overwhelming                            factor is the disaffected Tamil minority with its racial and possible                            political links to the Tamils in India Trade is not at present a                            factor but negotiations are underway to expand it under state                            direction Bhutan and Burma are exceptions The common border between                            India andBurma lies at the extremity of Indias most isolated region                            and since 1961 Burma has consciously restricted contact with other                            countries including India Bhutan has the potential for becoming                            another but to date the low levels of economic and political                            development in Bhutan and its international isolation have prevented                            this2 Historic Relationships: India has already involved itself in these                            countries Although on occasion eg in Ceylon in 1971 this was on                            behalf of the established government the tendency is to remember                            Instances when India supported interventionin the early 1960s when the                            Nepali Congress Party mounted raids into Nepal from India in 1971 when                            India supported the Bangladesh liberation effort and in 1973 when it                            tightened its grip on its protectorate Sikkim The largest and most                            important of these smaller neighbors Bangladeshobviously welcomed Indian                            intervention Even so historic problems resulting from the close                            physical relationshipproblems left over from the period of                            confrontation under the Pakistan regimeare not proving amenable to                            solution3 Indian Policy: Since 1971 India has sought to reassure its smaller                            neighbors that it accepts and wishes to strengthen the existing state                            system in South Asia It has played down its involvement in the affairs                            of its neighbors has tried to resolve manyold problems and has acted                            effectively and often generously to head off some new ones Indian                            officials have been visiting discussing explaining and giving                            assistance Mrs Gandhi has gone to Kathmandu Dacca Thimphu Bhutan                            and Colombo and her ministers have followed up Discussions with                            Bangladesh have been almost continuous At least some progress seems to                            have been achieved in speeding up implementation of the                            plantationworker Tamils from Sri Lanka in discussing with Sri Lanka                            the question of sovereignty over tiny Kachchitivu Island in joint                            development of the water and hydroelectric resources of Nepal in                            agreeing not to divert the waters of the Ganges at Farakka before                            agreement is reached with Bangladesh and in fresh economic assistance                            for all three countries                             Nevertheless in the context of this overall correct relationship                            there are instances when India feels constrained to lean on its                            neighbors Such pressure has been and is still more likely to fall on                            Nepal than the other small neighbors because of the extreme closeness                            of the physical economic and historic relationship India has always                            been concerned about Chinese aid projects in the portion of Nepal                            bordering India It objected to the Chinese cottongrowing experiment                            there and either has or probably will object to the proposed

to joint industrial ventures planning coordination and food                            grain sales by the Nepalese Government to India Finally India applied                            the screws to involve the King to a greater extent in Mrs Gandhis visit to Nepal4 Determining Factors: a Security: Indias main interest in its                            smaller neighbors is security against China This is particularly true                            in the case of Nepal Bangladesh Bhutan and Sikkim any of which would                            provide China with strategic access to the southern side of the                            Himalayas The island of Sri Lanka on the other hand is less of a                            problem and India has historically been willing to tolerate a higher                            level of Chinese involvement there where Chinese access is at the end                            of a long sea route than in the north5  Security against China requires a reasonable stable governments which b are not antiIndia                            Stable governments are also important in Nepal Bangladesh and Bhutan                            because conflict there could easily spill across the open border into                            similar areas of India India prefers democratic governments such as                            those in Bangladesh and Sri Lanka in part because it considers them                            less likely to be antiIndia It is also satisfied with the monarchy in                            Bhutan because it appears stable and friendly for the time being It has                            doubts about the longrun chances of survival of the monarchy in Nepal                            however and about the stability of the government in Bangladesh and Sri                            Lanka It is basically satisfied none of these governments is now repeat                            now pursuing an antiIndian policy although there is abundant                            antiIndian feeling in each country Much of Indian policy toward them                            is intended to serve the dual objective of keeping them from becoming                            antiIndian while helping to maintain at least shortterm stability                            Economic aid to Bangladesh and Nepal for example is intended to keep                            them friendly as well as to help to prevent the economic problems of                            those countries from getting to the point where they would threaten                            order6 While preferring to achieve its objectives by its present approach                            India has not ruled out intervention It allows dissident Nepali                            Congress Party leaders to live in India in part probably because it                            sees some use for them if the monarchy ultimately collapses In Sri                            Lanka in 1971 it helped the government against the insurgents as did                            the United States the Soviet Union and Pakistan Indian officials                            claim they would do so again if asked In 1973 India intervened when the                            situation got out of hand in Sikkim which in any case had never                            achieved the level of independence of the other Himalayan states under                            either the British or India Beyond these instances however Indian                            action will probably depend on circumstances such as the degree of                            threat and the likelihood of wider involvement India would probably                            help Bangladesh at the latters request to subdue a revolt in one                            district A more widespread uprising election of an antiIndian                            government or a broad breakdown of governmental organization and order                            would present difficult choices about which the GOI prefers not to think right now and about which almost                            no Indians appear to have clearly defined ideas7 b Indias Self Image: Talk of Indias dominant position in the area                            raises the hackles of its smaller neighbors India recognizes this and                            protests it is not a power But it cannot deny the fact of its dominance and it expects its                            smaller neighbors to recognize if not acknowledge it One still hears                            occasional talk of possible encirclement of India by its smaller                            neighbors supported by the United States American assistance to these                            countries thus produces an ambivalent Indian reaction India recognizes                            these countries need the assistance but it also recalls that in at                            least one of these countries Nepal the United States no longer sees                            its interests as derivative of its interests in India8 c Domestic Political Pressures: The linkages between India and her                            smaller neighbors have created groups within India with a special                            interest in Indian relations with these countries They articulate these                            interests through the Indian domestic political process Thus Indian                            Congress Party members from areas bordering Nepal press for Indian                            support for the Nepali Congress against the monarchy Indian businessmen                            trading with Nepal lobby in India for their own interests Some West                            Bengalis and other Indian businessmen have both real and sentimental                            interests in reestablishing the semicolonial pre1947 relationship                            between Calcutta and its natural economic and cultural hinterlandnow                            Bangladesh Finally the regional party ruling the South Indian state of                            Tamil Nadu supports the cause of the Tamils in Sri Lanka The GOI appears to be successfully resisting                            these pressures at present Mrs Gandhi stands aloof from the Nepali Congress and the GOI doesnt lend official support even if it deliberately                            or inadvertently fails to catch Nepali Congress perpetrators of last                            years armed attack and the recent hijacking The GOI also severely restricts other travel of                            West Bengalis and other Indian businessmen to Bangladesh in order to                            prevent charges that they are trying to reestablish domination over the                            area It does not support the Tamil autonomistseparatist movement in                            Sri Lanka Pressure on the GOI to change                            these policies may become more insistent however if the clash of                            central and state Interests becomes sharper eg if Bangladesh remains                            adamant against diversion of the Ganges at the Farakka barrage to flush                            out the port of Calcutta or in the competition for votes at election                            time9 d Bureaucratic Differences and Inefficiencies: The correct posture                            represents the position of the Foreign Ministry On important issues it                            is usually able to impose its view on other ministries But given their                            proximity and the depth of their involvement with India its smaller                            neighbors often find themselves dealing directly with other ministries                            or even with state governments Here parochial interests come into play                            and tend to undermine the good intentions of the Foreign Ministry Thus                            the Commerce Ministry may take a tough line with Bangladesh about                            settlement of its trade balances Sri Lanka finds customs andor trade                            officials turning away bottled imports from Sri Lanka because the import                            content in the bottle caps is higher than the agreed limit Nepal has a long list                            of complaints about the customs excise and state trading authorities                            One suspects the Indian bureaucrats in these other ministries also are                            not always as considerate of the sensibilities of these smaller                            countries as their Foreign Ministry counterparts All of this grates on                            proud officials of Nepal Bangladesh and Sri Lanka10 Prospects and US Interests: The official Indian policy is consonant                            with our interest in having a South Asia of stable independent states                            where no outside power has an exclusive position We should recognize                            that there will continue to be instances when as a result of pressures                            on and forces at play within the GOI                            India sends its neighbors signals at variance with the official GOI position Indias relations with her                            smaller neighbors will continue to be marked by periodic flareups                            particularly we believe in the case of relations with Nepal and                            Bangladesh All the smaller neighbors suspect India really wants                            hegemony and indeed it may They react by trying to maintain close                            relations with world powers While we can argue that such relations help                            India by reducing the supersensitivity and increasing the economic                            viability of its neighbors they also decrease Indian leverage over                            these countries This is an ambiguity we must live with We have made                            clear that we are not going to give India a veto over our relations with                            these countries The most we can do is to try to avoid creating                            unnecessary suspicions and to set the Indians straight swiftly  and frankly if they begin                            acting as though we are poaching on their turf11 The big question is Bangladesh which could turn rabidly antiIndian                            This will be depicted as the result of American or SinoAmerican                            intervention We have already raised this point at the highest levels of                            the Indian Government saying dont let it get started but I personally                            question whether any policy or conduct on our part will significantly                            effect the outcome whatever that turns out to be Some destinies are                            just that: destinedMOYNIHAN DPM                                initialed,frus1969-76ve08d145,"1. INDIAN INVOLVEMENT: GIVEN THE CLOSE TIES BETWEEN INDIA AND MOST OF ITS SMALLER, INDEPENDENTLY MINDED NEIGHBORS, FRICTION IS ALMOST INEVITABLE. ALL HAVE IN COMMON A BACKGROUND OF PARTICIPATION IN THE HISTORY OF THE GEOGRAPHIC REGION NOW DOMINATED BY INDIA. PRESENT-DAY LINKS VARY BUT ARE CLOSE. NEPAL IS LANDLOCKED WITH ITS ONLY ECONOMIC ACCESS TO THE REST OF THE WORLD ACROSS INDIA. MOST OF ITS TRADE IS WITH INDIA. BOTH IT AND BANGLADESH HAVE LONG SIEVE-LIKE BORDERS WITH INDIA. THE EVOLVING TIES BETWEEN INDIA AND BANGLADESH REFLECT INDIAS KEY ROLE IN THE ""LIBERATION"" OF BANGLADESH AND ITS POST-WAR ASSISTANCE TO THE NEW COUNTRY. VARIOUS FORMS OF INDIAN AID ALREADY SPENT OR PROGRAMMED TOTAL ABOUT $330 MILLION; TRADE RELATIONS ARE BEING DEVELOPED; AND BENGALIS ON BOTH SIDES OF THE BORDER SHARE A COMMON CULTURAL HERITAGE. IN THE CASE OF SRI LANKA, THE OVERWHELMING FACTOR IS THE DISAFFECTED TAMIL MINORITY WITH ITS RACIAL AND POSSIBLE POLITICAL LINKS TO THE TAMILS IN INDIA. TRADE IS NOT AT PRESENT A FACTOR, BUT NEGOTIATIONS ARE UNDERWAY TO EXPAND IT, UNDER STATE DIRECTION. BHUTAN AND BURMA ARE EXCEPTIONS. THE COMMON BORDER BETWEEN INDIA AND BURMA LIES AT THE EXTREMITY OF INDIAS MOST ISOLATED REGION, SINCE 1961 BURMA HAS CONSCIOUSLY RESTRICTED CONTACT WITH OTHER COUNTRIES, INCLUDING INDIA. BHUTAN HAS THE POTENTIAL FOR BECOMING ANOTHER NEPAL, BUT TO DATE THE LOW LEVELS OF ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL DEVELOPMENT IN BHUTAN AND ITS INTERNATIONAL ISOLATION HAVE PREVENTED THIS.\n2. HISTORIC RELATIONSHIPS: INDIA HAS ALREADY INVOLVED ITSELF CONFIDENTIAL IN THESE COUNTRIES. ALTHOUGH ON OCCASION (E.G., IN CEYLON IN\n3. INDIAN POLICY: SINCE 1971 INDIA HAS SOUGHT TO REASSURE ITS SMALLER NEIGHBORS THAT IT ACCEPTS AND WISHES TO STRENGTHEN THE EXISTING STATE SYSTEM IN SOUTH ASIA. IT HAS PLAYED DOWN ITS INVOLVEMENT IN THE AFFAIRS OF ITS NEIGHBORS, HAS TRIED TO RESOLVE MANY OLD PROBLEMS. AND HAS ACTED EFFECTIVELY AND OFTEN GENEROUSLY TO HEAD OFF SOME NEW ONES. INDIAN OFFICIALS HAVE BEEN VISITING, DISCUSSING, EXPLAINING AND GIVING ASSISTANCE. MRS. GANDHI HAS GONE TO KATHMANDU, DACCA, THIMPHU (BHUTAN), AND COLOMBO, AND HER MINISTERS HAVE FOLLOWED UP. DISCUSSIONS WITH BANGLA- DESH HAVE BEEN ALMOST CONTINUOUS. AT LEAST SOME PROGRESS SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN ACHIEVED IN SPEEDING UP IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PLANTATION-WORKER TAMILS FROM SRI LANKA, IN DISCUSSING WITH SRI LANKA THE QUESTION OF SOVEREIGNTY OVER TINY KACHCHITIVU ISLAND, IN JOINT DEVELOPMENT OF THE WATER AND HYDRO-ELECTRIC RESOURCES OF NEPAL, IN AGREEING NOT TO DIVERT THE WATERS OF THE GANGES AT FARAKKA BEFORE AGREEMENT IS REACHED WITH BANGLA- DESH, AND IN FRESH ECONOMIC ASSISTANCE FOR ALL THREE COUNTRIES. NEVERTHELESS, IN THE CONTEXT OF THIS OVERALL ""CORRECT"" RELATION- SHIP, THERE ARE INSTANCES WHEN INDIA FEELS CONSTRAINED TO LEAN ON ITS NEIGHBORS. SUCH PRESSURE HAS BEEN AND IS STILL MORE LIKELY TO FALL ON NEPAL THAN THE OTHER SMALL NEIGHBORS, BECAUSE OF THE EXTREME CLOSENESS OF THE PHYSICAL, ECONOMIC AND HISTORIC RELATIONSHIP. INDIA HAS ALWAYS BEEN CONCERNED ABOUT CHINESE AID PROJECTS IN THE PORTION OF NEPAL BORDERING INDIA. IT OBJECTED TO THE CHINESE COTTON-GROWING EXPERIMENT THERE AND EITHER HAS OR PROBABLY WILL OBJECT TO THE PROPOSED CHINESE-ASSISTED TEXTILE MILL. ALTHOUGH GENERALLY ACCOMMODATING CONFIDENTIAL ON THE AID AND TRADE SIDE RECENTLY, INDIA HAS PRESSED NEPAL (UNSUCCESSFULLY) TO AGREE TO JOINT INDUSTRIAL VENTURES, PLANNING COORDINATION,IOND FOOD GRAIN SALES BY THE NEPALESE GOVERNMENT TO INDIA. FINALLY, INDIA APPLIED THE SCREWS TO INVOLVE THE KING TO A GREATER EXTENT IN MRS. GANDHIS VISIT TO NEPAL.\n4. DETERMINING FACTORS: (A) SECURITY: INDIAS MAIN INTEREST IN ITS SMALLER NEIGHBORS IS SECURITY AGAINST CHINA. THIS IS PARTICULARLY TRUE IN THE CASE OF NEPAL, BANGLADESH, BHUTAN AND SIKKIM, ANY OF WHICH WOULD PROVIDE CHINA WITH STRATEGIC ACCESS TO THE SOUTHERN SIDE OF THE HIMALAYAS. THE ISLAND OF SRI LANKA, ON THE OTHER HAND, IS LESS OF A PROBLEM, AND INDIA HAS HISTORICALLY BEEN WILLING TO TOLERATE A HIGHER LEVEL OF CHINESE INVOLVEMENT THERE, WHERE CHINESE ACCESS IS AT THE END OF A LONG SEA ROUTE, THAN IN THE NORTH.\n5. SECURITY AGAINSTCHINA REQUIRES (A) REASONABLE STABLE GOVERNMENTS WHICH (B) ARE NOT ANTI-INDIA. (STABLE GOVERNMENTS ARE ALSO IMPORTANT IN NEPAL, BANGLADESH, AND BHUTAN BECAUSE CONFLICT THERE COULD EASILY SPILL ACROSS THE OPEN BORDER INTO SIMILAR AREAS OF INDIA.) INDIA PREFERS DEMOCRATIC GOVERNMENTS SUCH AS THOSE IN BANGLADESH AND SRI LANKA, IN PART BECAUSE IT CONSIDERS THEM LESS LIKELY TO BE ANTI-INDIA. IT IS ALSO SATISFIED WITH THE MONARCHY IN BHUTAN BECAUSE IT APPEARS STABLE AND FRIENDLY FOR THE TIME BEING. IT HAS DOUBTS ABOUT THE LONG- RUN CHANCES OF SURVIVAL OF THE MONARCHY IN NAPAL, HOWEVER, AND ABOUT THE STABILITY OF THE GOVERNMENTS IN BANGLADESH AND SRI LANKA. IT IS BASICALLY SATISFIED NONE OF THESE GOVERNMENTS IS NOW REPEAT NOW PURSUING ON ANTI-INDIAN POLICY (ALTHOUGH THERE IS ABUNDANT ANTI-INDIAN FEELING IN EACH COUNTRY). MUCH DOF INDIAN POLICY TOWARD THEM IS INTENDED TO SERVE THE DUAL OBJECTIVE OF KEEPING THEM FROM BECOMING ANTI-INDIAN WHILE HELPING TO MAINTAIN AT LEAST SHORT-TERM STABILITY. ECONOMIC AID TO BANGLADESH AND NEPAL, FOR EXAMPLE, IS INTENDED TO KEEP THEM FRIENDLY AS WELL AS TO HELP TO PREVENT THE ECONOMIC PROBLEMS OF THOSE COUNTRIES FROM GETTING TO THE POINT WHERE THEY WOULD THREATEN ORDER.\n6. WHILE PREFERRING TO ACHIEVE ITS OBJECTIVES BY ITS PRESENT CONFIDENTIAL APPROACH, INDIA HAS NOT RULED OUT INTERVENTION. IT ALLOWS DISSIDENT NEPALI CONGRESS PARTY LEADERS TO LIVE IN INDIA IN PART, PROBABLY, BECAUSE IT SEES SOME USE FOR THEM IF THE MONARCHY ULTIMATELY COLLAPSES. IN SRI LANKA IN 1971 IT HELPED THE GOVERNMENT AGAINST THE INSURGENTS, AS DID THE UNITED STATES, THE SOVIET UNION, AND PAKISTAN. INDIA OFFICIALS CLAIM THEY WOULD DO SO AGAIN IF ASKED. IN 1973 INDIA INTERVENED WHEN THE SITUATION GOT OUT OF HAND IN SIKKIM. WHICH IN ANY CASE HAD NEVER ACHIEVED THE LEVEL OF INDEPENDENCE OF THE OTHER HIMALAYAN STATES, UNDER EITHER THE BRITISH OR INDIA. BEYOND THESE INSTANCES, HOWEVER, INDIA ACTION WILL PROBABLY DEPEND ON CIRCUMSTANCES, SUCH AS THE DEGREE OF THREAT AND THE LIKELI- HOOD OF WIDER INVOLVEMENT. INDIA WOULD PROBABLY HELP BANGLA- DESH, AT THE LATTERS REQUEST, TO SUBDUE A REVOLT IN ONE DISTRICT. A MORE WIDESPREAD UPRISING, ELECTION OF AN ANTI-INDIAN GOVERN- MENT OR A BROAD BREAKDOWN OF GOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATION AND ORDER, WOULD PRESENT DIFFICULT CHOICES ABOUT WHICH THE GOI PREFERS NOT TO THINK RIGHT NOW AND ABOUT WHICH ALMOST NO INDIANS APPEAR TO HAVE CLEARLY DEFINED IDEAS.\n7. (B) INDIAS SELF IMAGE: TALK OF INDIAS DOMINANT POSITION IN THE AREA RAISES THE HACKLES OF ITS SMALLER NEIGHBORS. INDIA RECOGNIZES THIS AND PROTESTS IT IS NOT A POWER. BUT IT CANNOT DENY THE FACT OF ITS DOMINANCE, AND IT EXPECTS ITS SMALLER NEIGHBORS TO RECOGNIZE IF NOT ACKNOWLEDGE IT. ONE STILL HEARS OCCASIONAL TALK OF POSSIBLE ""ENCIRCLEMENT"" OF INDIA BY ITS SMALLER NEIGHBORS, SUPPORTED BY THE UNITED STATES. AMERICAN ASSISTANCE TO THESE COUNTRIES THUS PRODUCES AN AMBIVALENT INDIAN REACTION. INDIA RECOGNIZES THESE COUNTRIES NEED THE ASSISTANCE, BUT IT ALSO RECALLS THAT IN AT LEAST ONE OF THESE COUNTRIES (NEPAL) THE UNITED STATES NO LONGER SEES ITS INTERESTS AS DERIVATIVE OF ITS INTERESTS IN INDIA.\n8. (C) DOMESTIC POLITICAL PRESSURES: THE LINKAGES BETWEEN INDIA AND HER SMALLER NEIGHBORS HAVE CREATED GROUPS WITHIN INDIA WITH A SPECIAL INTEREST IN INDIAN RELATIONS WITH THESE COUNTRIES. THEY ARTICULATE THESE INTERESTS THROUGH THE INDIAN DOMESTIC POLITICAL PROCESS. THUS, INDIAN CONGRESS PARTY MEMBERS FROM AREAS BORDERING NEPAL PRESS FOR INDIAN SUPPORT FOR THE FRATERNAL NEPALI CONGRESS AGAINSG THE MONARCHY. INDIAN BUSINESSMEN TRADING WITH NEPAL LOBBY IN INDIA FOR THEIR OWN INTERESTS. CONFIDENTIAL SOME WEST BENGALIS AND OTHER INDIAN BUSINESSMEN HAVE BOTH REAL AND SENTIMENTAL INTERESTS IN RE-ESTABLISHING THE SEMI-COLONIAL PRE-1947 RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN CALCUTTA AND ITS NATURAL ECONOMIC AND CULTURAL HINTERLAND--NOW BANGLADESH. FINALLY, THE REGIONAL PARTY RULING THE SOUTH INDIAN STATE OF TAMIL NADU SUPPORTS THE CAUSE OF THE TAMILS IN SRI LANKA. THE GOI APPEARS TO BE SUCCESSFULLY RESISTING THESE PRESSURES AT PRESENT. MRS. GANDHI STANDS ALOOF FROM THE NEPALI CONGRESS, AND THE GOI DOESNT LEND OFFICIAL SUPPORT EVEN IF IT DELIBERATELY OR INADVERTENTLY FAILS TO CATCH NEPALI CONGRESS PERPETRATORS OF LAST YEARS ARMED ATTACK AND THE RECENT HIJACKING. THE GOI ALSO SEVERELY RESTRICTS TRAVEL OF WEST BENGALIS AND OTHER INDIAN BUSINESSMEN TO BANGLADESH IN ORDER TO PREVENT CHARGES THAT THEY ARE TRYING TO RE-ESTABLISH DOMINATION OVER THE AREA. IT DOES NOT SUPPORT THE TAMIL AUTONOMIST/SEPARATIST MOVEMENT IN SRI LANKA. PRESSURE ON THE GOI TO CHANGE THESE POLICIES MAY BECOME MORE INSISTENT, HOWEVER, IF THE CLASH OF CENTRAL AND STATE INTERESTS BECOMES SHARPER (E.G., IF BANGLADESH REMAINS ADAMENT AGAINST DIVERSION OF THE GANGES AT THE FARAKKA BARRAGE TO FLUSH OUT THE PORT OF CALCUTTA) OR IN THE COMPETITION FOR VOTES AT ELECTION TIME.\n9. (D) BUREAUCRATIC DIFFERENCES AND INEFFICIENCIES: THE ""CORRECT"" POSTURE REPRESENTS THE POSITION OF THE FOREIGN MINISTRY. ON IMPORTANT ISSUES IT IS USUALLY ABLE TO IMPOSE ITS VIEW ON OTHER MINISTRIES. BUT GIVEN THEIR PROXIMITY AND TEH DEPTH OF THEIR INVOLVEMENT WITH INDIA, ITS SMALLER NEIGHBORS OFTER FIND THEMSELVES DEALING DIRECTLY WITH OTHER MINISTRIES, OR EVEN WITH STATE GOVERNMENTS. HERE PAROCHIAL INTERESTS COME INTO PLAY AND TEND TO UNDERMINE THE GOOD INTENTIONS OF THE FOREIGN MINISTRY. THUS, THE COMMERCE MINISTRY MAY TAKE A TOUGH LINE WITH BANGLADESH ABOUT SETTLEMENT OF ITS TRADE BALANCES; SRI LANKA FINDS CUSTOMS AND/OR TRADE OFFICIALS TURNING AWAY BOTTLED IMPORTS FROM SRI LANKA BECAUSE THE IMPORT CONTENT IN THE BOTTLE CAPS IS HIGHER THAN THE AGREED LIMIT; NEPAL HAS A LONG LIST OF COM- PLAINTS ABOUT THE CUSTOMS, EXCISE AND STATE TRADING AUTHORITIES. ONE SUSPECTS THE INDIAN BUREAUCRATS IN THESE OTHER MINISTRIES ALSO ARE NOT ALWAYS AS CONSIDERATE OF THE SENSIBILITIES OF THESE SMALLER COUNTRIES AS THEIR FOREIGN MINISTRY COUNTERPARTS. ALL OF THIS GRATES ON PROUD OFFICIALS OF NEPAL, BANGLADESH AND SRI LANKA.\n0. PROPSECTS AND US INTERESTS: THE OFFICIAL INDIAN POLICY IS CONSONANT WITH OUR INTEREST IN HAVING A SOUTH ASIA OF STABLE, INDEPENDENT STATES WHERE NO OUTSIDE POWER HAS AN EXCLUSIVE POSITION. WE SHOULD RECOGNIZE THAT THERE WILL CONTINUE TO BE INSTANCES WHEN, AS A RESULT OF PRESSURES ON AND FORCES AT PLAY WITHIN THE GOI, INDIA SENDS ITS NEIGHBORS SIGNALS AT VARIANCE WITH THE OFFICIAL GOI POSITION. INDIAS RELATIONS WITH HER SMALLER NEIGHBORS WILL CONTINUE TO BE MARKED BY PERIODIC FLARE-UPS, PARTICULARLY WE BELEIVE IN THE CASE OF RELATIONS WITH NEPAL AND BANGLADESH. ALL THE SMALLER NEIGHBORS SUSPECT INDIA REALLY WANTS HEGEMONY AND INDEED IT MAY. THEY REACT BY TRYING TO MAINTAIN CLOSE RELATIONS WITH WORLD POWERS. WHILE WE CAN ARGUE THAT SUCH RELATIONS HELP INDIA BY REDUCING THE SUPSQ-SENSITIVITY AND INCREASING THE ECONOMIC VIABILITY OF ITS NEIGHBORS, THEY ALSO DECREASE INDIAN LEVERAGE OVER THESE COUNTRIES. THIS IS AN AMBIGUITY WE MUST LIVE WITH. WE HAVE MADE CLEAR THAT WE ARE NOT GOING TO GIVE INDIA A VETO OVER OUR RELATIONS WITH THESE COUNTRIES. THE MOST WE CAN DO IS TO TRY TO AVOID CREATING UNNECESSARY SUSPICIONS AND TO SET THE INDIANS STRAIGHT SWIFELY AND FRANKLY IF THEY BEGIN ACTING AS THOUGH WE ARE POACHING ON THEIR TURF.\n1. THE BIG QUESTION IS BANGLADESH, WHICH COULD TURN RABIDLY ANTI-INDIAN. THIS WILL BE DEPICTED AS THE RESULT OF AMERICAN OR SINO-AMERICAN INTERVENTION. WE HAVE ALREADY RAISED THIS POINT AT THE HIGHEST LEVELS OF THE INDIAN GOVERNMENT, SAYING DONT LET IT GET STARTED, BUT I PERSONALLY QUESTION WHETHER ANY POLICY OR CONDUCT ON OUR PART WILL SIGNIFICANTLY EFFECT THE OUTCOME, WHATEVER THAT TURNS OUT TO BE. SOME DESTINIES ARE JUST THAT: DESTINED.  MOYNIHAN  UNQUOTE  ROGERS\n",623460

neighborsNepal and Sri Lanka  It also                            added a new member Bangladeshto this group  While India is trying to reassure these countries                            by being correct and even generous in its official dealings with them                            it cannot deny either its overwhelming greater strength or its natural                            involvement in their affairs It does not want to incorporate them into                            India but it feels its security interests require that they should                            remain stable and free from Chinese control It prefers to use the                            carrot rather than the stick to achieve this objective But it has                            intervened forcefully in the affairs of certain of its neighbors in the                            past and all of them are painfully aware of this So long as Indian                            tactics are noninterventionist they are consonant with US policy                            Nevertheless the closeness of the countries specific Indian security                            considerations its selfimage as the dominant power

together will continue to create tensions between India and its smaller                            neighbors END SUMMARY1 Indian Involvement: Given the close ties between India and most of its                            smaller independently minded neighbors friction is almost inevitable                            All have in common a background of participation in the history of the                            geographic region now dominated by India Presentday links vary but are                            close Nepal is landlocked with its only economic access to the rest of                            the world across India Most of its trade is with India Both it and                            Bangladesh have long sievelike borders with India The evolving ties                            between India and Bangladesh reflect India s key role in the  liberation of Bangladesh and its                            postwar assistance to the new a country Various forms of Indian aid                            already spent or programmed total about 330 million trade relations                            are being developed and Bengalis on both sides of the border share a                            common cultural heritage In the case of Sri Lanka the overwhelming                            factor is the disaffected Tamil minority with its racial and possible                            political links to the Tamils in India Trade is not at present a                            factor but negotiations are underway to expand it under state                            direction Bhutan and Burma are exceptions The common border between                            India andBurma lies at the extremity of Indias most isolated region                            and since 1961 Burma has consciously restricted contact with other                            countries including India Bhutan has the potential for becoming                            another but to date the low levels of economic and political                            development in Bhutan and its international isolation have prevented                            this2 Historic Relationships: India has already involved itself in these                            countries Although on occasion eg in Ceylon in 1971 this was on                            behalf of the established government the tendency is to remember                            Instances when India supported interventionin the early 1960s when the                            Nepali Congress Party mounted raids into Nepal from India in 1971 when                            India supported the Bangladesh liberation effort and in 1973 when it                            tightened its grip on its protectorate Sikkim The largest and most                            important of these smaller neighbors Bangladeshobviously welcomed Indian                            intervention Even so historic problems resulting from the close                            physical relationshipproblems left over from the period of                            confrontation under the Pakistan regimeare not proving amenable to                            solution3 Indian Policy: Since 1971 India has sought to reassure its smaller                            neighbors that it accepts and wishes to strengthen the existing state                            system in South Asia It has played down its involvement in the affairs                            of its neighbors has tried to resolve manyold problems and has acted                            effectively and often generously to head off some new ones Indian                            officials have been visiting discussing explaining and giving                            assistance Mrs Gandhi has gone to Kathmandu Dacca Thimphu Bhutan                            and Colombo and her ministers have followed up Discussions with                            Bangladesh have been almost continuous At least some progress seems to                            have been achieved in speeding up implementation of the                            plantationworker Tamils from Sri Lanka in discussing with Sri Lanka                            the question of sovereignty over tiny Kachchitivu Island in joint                            development of the water and hydroelectric resources of Nepal in                            agreeing not to divert the waters of the Ganges at Farakka before                            agreement is reached with Bangladesh and in fresh economic assistance                            for all three countries                             Nevertheless in the context of this overall correct relationship                            there are instances when India feels constrained to lean on its                            neighbors Such pressure has been and is still more likely to fall on                            Nepal than the other small neighbors because of the extreme closeness                            of the physical economic and historic relationship India has always                            been concerned about Chinese aid projects in the portion of Nepal                            bordering India It objected to the Chinese cottongrowing experiment                            there and either has or probably will object to the proposed                            Chineseassisted textile mill Although generally accommodating on the                            aid and trade side recently India has pressed Nepal unsuccessfully to                            agree to joint industrial ventures planning coordination and food                            grain sales by the Nepalese Government to India Finally India applied                            the screws to involve the King to a greater extent in Mrs Gandhis visit to Nepal4 Determining Factors: a Security: Indias main interest in its                            smaller neighbors is security against China This is particularly true                            in the case of Nepal Bangladesh Bhutan and Sikkim any of which would                            provide China with strategic access to the southern side of the                            Himalayas The island of Sri Lanka on the other hand is less of a                            problem and India has historically been willing to tolerate a higher                            level of Chinese involvement there where Chinese access is at the end                            of a long sea route than in the north5  Security against China requires a reasonable stable governments which b are not antiIndia                            Stable governments are also important in Nepal Bangladesh and Bhutan                            because conflict there could easily spill across the open border into                            similar areas of India India prefers democratic governments such as                            those in Bangladesh and Sri Lanka in part because it considers them                            less likely to be antiIndia It is also satisfied with the monarchy in                            Bhutan because it appears stable and friendly for the time being It has                            doubts about the longrun chances of survival of the monarchy in Nepal                            however and about the stability of the government in Bangladesh and Sri                            Lanka It is basically satisfied none of these governments is now repeat                            now pursuing an antiIndian policy although there is abundant                            antiIndian feeling in each country Much of Indian policy toward them                            is intended to serve the dual objective of keeping them from becoming                            antiIndian while helping to maintain at least shortterm stability                            Economic aid to Bangladesh and Nepal for example is intended to keep                            them friendly as well as to help to prevent the economic problems of                            those countries from getting to the point where they would threaten                            order6 While preferring to achieve its objectives by its present approach                            India has not ruled out intervention It allows dissident Nepali                            Congress Party leaders to live in India in part probably because it                            sees some use for them if the monarchy ultimately collapses In Sri                            Lanka in 1971 it helped the government against the insurgents as did                            the United States the Soviet Union and Pakistan Indian officials                            claim they would do so again if asked In 1973 India intervened when the                            situation got out of hand in Sikkim which in any case had never                            achieved the level of independence of the other Himalayan states under                            either the British or India Beyond these instances however Indian                            action will probably depend on circumstances such as the degree of                            threat and the likelihood of wider involvement India would probably                            help Bangladesh at the latters request to subdue a revolt in one                            district A more widespread uprising election of an antiIndian                            government or a broad breakdown of governmental organization and order                            would present difficult choices about which the GOI prefers not to think right now and about which almost                            no Indians appear to have clearly defined ideas7 b Indias Self Image: Talk of Indias dominant position in the area                            raises the hackles of its smaller neighbors India recognizes this and                            protests it is not a power But it cannot deny the fact of its dominance and it expects its                            smaller neighbors to recognize if not acknowledge it One still hears                            occasional talk of possible encirclement of India by its smaller                            neighbors supported by the United States American assistance to these                            countries thus produces an ambivalent Indian reaction India recognizes                            these countries need the assistance but it also recalls that in at                            least one of these countries Nepal the United States no longer sees                            its interests as derivative of its interests in India8 c Domestic Political Pressures: The linkages between India and her                            smaller neighbors have created groups within India with a special                            interest in Indian relations with these countries They articulate these                            interests through the Indian domestic political process Thus Indian                            Congress Party members from areas bordering Nepal press for Indian                            support for the Nepali Congress against the monarchy Indian businessmen                            trading with Nepal lobby in India for their own interests Some West                            Bengalis and other Indian businessmen have both real and sentimental                            interests in reestablishing the semicolonial pre1947 relationship                            between Calcutta and its natural economic and cultural hinterlandnow                            Bangladesh Finally the regional party ruling the South Indian state of                            Tamil Nadu supports the cause of the Tamils in Sri Lanka The GOI appears to be successfully resisting                            these pressures at present Mrs Gandhi stands aloof from the Nepali Congress and the GOI doesnt lend official support even if it deliberately                            or inadvertently fails to catch Nepali Congress perpetrators of last                            years armed attack and the recent hijacking The GOI also severely restricts other travel of                            West Bengalis and other Indian businessmen to Bangladesh in order to                            prevent charges that they are trying to reestablish domination over the                            area It does not support the Tamil autonomistseparatist movement in                            Sri Lanka Pressure on the GOI to change                            these policies may become more insistent however if the clash of                            central and state Interests becomes sharper eg if Bangladesh remains                            adamant against diversion of the Ganges at the Farakka barrage to flush                            out the port of Calcutta or in the competition for votes at election                            time9 d Bureaucratic Differences and Inefficiencies: The correct posture                            represents the position of the Foreign Ministry On important issues it                            is usually able to impose its view on other ministries But given their                            proximity and the depth of their involvement with India its smaller                            neighbors often find themselves dealing directly with other ministries                            or even with state governments Here parochial interests come into play                            and tend to undermine the good intentions of the Foreign Ministry Thus                            the Commerce Ministry may take a tough line with Bangladesh about                            settlement of its trade balances Sri Lanka finds customs andor trade                            officials turning away bottled imports from Sri Lanka because the import                            content in the bottle caps is higher than the agreed limit Nepal has a long list                            of complaints about the customs excise and state trading authorities                            One suspects the Indian bureaucrats in these other ministries also are                            not always as considerate of the sensibilities of these smaller                            countries as their Foreign Ministry counterparts All of this grates on                            proud officials of Nepal Bangladesh and Sri Lanka10 Prospects and US Interests: The official Indian policy is consonant                            with our interest in having a South Asia of stable independent states                            where no outside power has an exclusive position We should recognize                            that there will continue to be instances when as a result of pressures                            on and forces at play within the GOI                            India sends its neighbors signals at variance with the official GOI position Indias relations with her                            smaller neighbors will continue to be marked by periodic flareups                            particularly we believe in the case of relations with Nepal and                            Bangladesh All the smaller neighbors suspect India really wants                            hegemony and indeed it may They react by trying to maintain close                            relations with world powers While we can argue that such relations help                            India by reducing the supersensitivity and increasing the economic                            viability of its neighbors they also decrease Indian leverage over                            these countries This is an ambiguity we must live with We have made                            clear that we are not going to give India a veto over our relations with                            these countries The most we can do is to try to avoid creating                            unnecessary suspicions and to set the Indians straight swiftly  and frankly if they begin                            acting as though we are poaching on their turf11 The big question is Bangladesh which could turn rabidly antiIndian                            This will be depicted as the result of American or SinoAmerican                            intervention We have already raised this point at the highest levels of                            the Indian Government saying dont let it get started but I personally                            question whether any policy or conduct on our part will significantly                            effect the outcome whatever that turns out to be Some destinies are                            just that: destinedMOYNIHAN DPM                                initialed,frus1969-76ve08d145,"1. INDIAN INVOLVEMENT: GIVEN THE CLOSE TIES BETWEEN INDIA AND MOST OF ITS SMALLER, INDEPENDENTLY MINDED NEIGHBORS, FRICTION IS ALMOST INEVITABLE. ALL HAVE IN COMMON A BACKGROUND OF PARTICIPATION IN THE HISTORY OF THE GEOGRAPHIC REGION NOW DOMINATED BY INDIA. PRESENT-DAY LINKS VARY BUT ARE CLOSE. NEPAL IS LANDLOCKED WITH ITS ONLY ECONOMIC ACCESS TO THE REST OF THE WORLD ACROSS INDIA. MOST OF ITS TRADE IS WITH INDIA. BOTH IT AND BANGLADESH HAVE LONG SIEVE-LIKE BORDERS WITH INDIA. THE EVOLVING TIES BETWEEN INDIA AND BANGLADESH REFLECT INDIAS KEY ROLE IN THE ""LIBERATION"" OF BANGLADESH AND ITS POST-WAR ASSISTANCE TO THE NEW COUNTRY. VARIOUS FORMS OF INDIAN AID ALREADY SPENT OR PROGRAMMED TOTAL ABOUT $330 MILLION; TRADE RELATIONS ARE BEING DEVELOPED; AND BENGALIS ON BOTH SIDES OF THE BORDER SHARE A COMMON CULTURAL HERITAGE. IN THE CASE OF SRI LANKA, THE OVERWHELMING FACTOR IS THE DISAFFECTED TAMIL MINORITY WITH ITS RACIAL AND POSSIBLE POLITICAL LINKS TO THE TAMILS IN INDIA. TRADE IS NOT AT PRESENT A FACTOR, BUT NEGOTIATIONS ARE UNDERWAY TO EXPAND IT, UNDER STATE DIRECTION. BHUTAN AND BURMA ARE EXCEPTIONS. THE COMMON BORDER BETWEEN INDIA AND BURMA LIES AT THE EXTREMITY OF INDIAS MOST ISOLATED REGION, SINCE 1961 BURMA HAS CONSCIOUSLY RESTRICTED CONTACT WITH OTHER COUNTRIES, INCLUDING INDIA. BHUTAN HAS THE POTENTIAL FOR BECOMING ANOTHER NEPAL, BUT TO DATE THE LOW LEVELS OF ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL CONFIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENT IN BHUTAN AND ITS INTERNATIONAL ISOLATION HAVE PREVENTED THIS.\n2. HISTORIC RELATIONSHIPS: INDIA HAS ALREADY INVOLVED ITSELF IN THESE COUNTRIES. ALTHOUGH ON OCCASION (E.G., IN CEYLON IN\n3. INDIAN POLICY: SINCE 1971 INDIA HAS SOUGHT TO REASSURE ITS SMALLER NEIGHBORS THAT IT ACCEPTS AND WISHES TO STRENGTHEN THE EXISTING STATE SYSTEM IN SOUTH ASIA. IT HAS PLAYED DOWN ITS INVOLVEMENT IN THE AFFAIRS OF ITS NEIGHBORS, HAS TRIED TO RESOLVE MANY OLD PROBLEMS. AND HAS ACTED EFFECTIVELY AND OFTEN GENEROUSLY TO HEAD OFF SOME NEW ONES. INDIAN OFFICIALS HAVE BEEN VISITING, DISCUSSING, EXPLAINING AND GIVING ASSISTANCE. MRS. GANDHI HAS GONE TO KATHMANDU, DACCA, THIMPHU (BHUTAN), AND COLOMBO, AND HER MINISTERS HAVE FOLLOWED UP. DISCUSSIONS WITH BANGLA- DESH HAVE BEEN ALMOST CONTINUOUS. AT LEAST SOME PROGRESS SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN ACHIEVED IN SPEEDING UP IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PLANTATION-WORKER TAMILS FROM SRI LANKA, IN DISCUSSING WITH SRI LANKA THE QUESTION OF SOVEREIGNTY OVER TINY KACHCHITIVU ISLAND, IN JOINT DEVELOPMENT OF THE WATER AND HYDRO-ELECTRIC RESOURCES OF NEPAL, IN AGREEING NOT TO DIVERT THE WATERS OF THE GANGES AT FARAKKA BEFORE AGREEMENT IS REACHED WITH BANGLA- DESH, AND IN FRESH ECONOMIC ASSISTANCE FOR ALL THREE COUNTRIES. NEVERTHELESS, IN THE CONTEXT OF THIS OVERALL ""CORRECT"" RELATION- SHIP, THERE ARE INSTANCES WHEN INDIA FEELS CONSTRAINED TO LEAN ON ITS NEIGHBORS. SUCH PRESSURE HAS BEEN AND IS STILL MORE LIKELY TO FALL ON NEPAL THAN THE OTHER SMALL NEIGHBORS, BECAUSE OF THE EXTREME CLOSENESS OF THE PHYSICAL, ECONOMIC AND HISTORIC RELATIONSHIP. INDIA HAS ALWAYS BEEN CONCERNED CONFIDENTIAL ABOUT CHINESE AID PROJECTS IN THE PORTION E E E E E E E E\n6. WHILE PREFERRING TO ACHIEVE ITS OBJECTIVES BY ITS PRESENT APPROACH, INDIA HAS NOT RULED OUT INTERVENTION. IT ALLOWS DISSIDENT NEPALI CONGRESS PARTY LEADERS TO LIVE IN INDIA CONFIDENTIAL IN PART, PROBABLY, BECAUSE IT SEES SOME USE FOR THEM IF THE MONARCHY ULTIMATELY COLLAPSES. IN SRI LANKA IN 1971 IT HELPED THE GOVERNMENT AGAINST THE INSURGENTS, AS DID THE UNITED STATES, THE SOVIET UNION, AND PAKISTAN. INDIA OFFICIALS CLAIM THEY WOULD DO SO AGAIN IF ASKED. IN 1973 INDIA INTERVENED WHEN THE SITUATION GOT OUT OF HAND IN SIKKIM. WHICH IN ANY CASE HAD NEVER ACHIEVED THE LEVEL OF INDEPENDENCE OF THE OTHER HIMALAYAN STATES, UNDER EITHER THE BRITISH OR INDIA. BEYOND THESE INSTANCES, HOWEVER, INDIA ACTION WILL PROBABLY DEPEND ON CIRCUMSTANCES, SUCH AS THE DEGREE OF THREAT AND THE LIKELI- HOOD OF WIDER INVOLVEMENT. INDIA WOULD PROBABLY HELP BANGLA- DESH, AT THE LATTERS REQUEST, TO SUBDUE A REVOLT IN ONE DISTRICT. A MORE WIDESPREAD UPRISING, ELECTION OF AN ANTI-INDIAN GOVERN- MENT OR A BROAD BREAKDOWN OF GOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATION AND ORDER, WOULD PRESENT DIFFICULT CHOICES ABOUT WHICH THE GOI PREFERS NOT TO THINK RIGHT NOW AND ABOUT WHICH ALMOST NO INDIANS APPEAR TO HAVE CLEARLY DEFINED IDEAS.\n7. (B) INDIAS SELF IMAGE: TALK OF INDIAS DOMINANT POSITION IN THE AREA RAISES THE HACKLES OF ITS SMALLER NEIGHBORS. INDIA RECOGNIZES THIS AND PROTESTS IT IS NOT A POWER. BUT IT CANNOT DENY THE FACT OF ITS DOMINANCE, AND IT EXPECTS ITS SMALLER NEIGHBORS TO RECOGNIZE IF NOT ACKNOWLEDGE IT. ONE STILL HEARS OCCASIONAL TALK OF POSSIBLE ""ENCIRCLEMENT"" OF INDIA BY ITS SMALLER NEIGHBORS, SUPPORTED BY THE UNITED STATES. AMERICAN ASSISTANCE TO THESE COUNTRIES THUS PRODUCES AN AMBIVALENT INDIAN REACTION. INDIA RECOGNIZES THESE COUNTRIES NEED THE ASSISTANCE, BUT IT ALSO RECALLS THAT IN AT LEAST ONE OF THESE COUNTRIES (NEPAL) THE UNITED STATES NO LONGER SEES ITS INTERESTS AS DERIVATIVE OF ITS INTERESTS IN INDIA.\n8. (C) DOMESTIC POLITICAL PRESSURES: THE LINKAGES BETWEEN INDIA AND HER SMALLER NEIGHBORS HAVE CREATED GROUPS WITHIN INDIA WITH A SPECIAL INTEREST IN INDIAN RELATIONS WITH THESE COUNTRIES. THEY ARTICULATE THESE INTERESTS THROUGH THE INDIAN DOMESTIC POLITICAL PROCESS. THUS, INDIAN CONGRESS PARTY MEMBERS FROM AREAS BORDERING NEPAL PRESS FOR INDIAN SUPPORT FOR THE FRATERNAL NEPALI CONGRESS AGAINSG THE MONARCHY. INDIAN BUSINESSMEN TRADING WITH NEPAL LOBBY IN INDIA FOR THEIR OWN INTERESTS. SOME WEST BENGALIS AND OTHER INDIAN BUSINESSMEN HAVE BOTH REAL AND SENTIMENTAL INTERESTS IN RE-ESTABLISHING THE SEMI-COLONIAL CONFIDENTIAL PRE-1947 RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN CALCUTTA AND ITS NATURAL ECONOMIC AND CULTURAL HINTERLAND--NOW BANGLADESH. FINALLY, THE REGIONAL PARTY RULING THE SOUTH INDIAN STATE OF TAMIL NADU SUPPORTS THE CAUSE OF THE TAMILS IN SRI LANKA. THE GOI APPEARS TO BE SUCCESSFULLY RESISTING THESE PRESSURES AT PRESENT. MRS. GANDHI STANDS ALOOF FROM THE NEPALI CONGRESS, AND THE GOI DOESNT LEND OFFICIAL SUPPORT EVEN IF IT DELIBERATELY OR INADVERTENTLY FAILS TO CATCH NEPALI CONGRESS PERPETRATORS OF LAST YEARS ARMED ATTACK AND THE RECENT HIJACKING. THE GOI ALSO SEVERELY RESTRICTS TRAVEL OF WEST BENGALIS AND OTHER INDIAN BUSINESSMEN TO BANGLADESH IN ORDER TO PREVENT CHARGES THAT THEY ARE TRYING TO RE-ESTABLISH DOMINATION OVER THE AREA. IT DOES NOT SUPPORT THE TAMIL AUTONOMIST/SEPARATIST MOVEMENT IN SRI LANKA. PRESSURE ON THE GOI TO CHANGE THESE POLICIES MAY BECOME MORE INSISTENT, HOWEVER, IF THE CLASH OF CENTRAL AND STATE INTERESTS BECOMES SHARPER (E.G., IF BANGLADESH REMAINS ADAMENT AGAINST DIVERSION OF THE GANGES AT THE FARAKKA BARRAGE TO FLUSH OUT THE PORT OF CALCUTTA) OR IN THE COMPETITION FOR VOTES AT ELECTION TIME.\n9. (D) BUREAUCRATIC DIFFERENCES AND INEFFICIENCIES: THE ""CORRECT"" POSTURE REPRESENTS THE POSITION OF THE FOREIGN MINISTRY. ON IMPORTANT ISSUES IT IS USUALLY ABLE TO IMPOSE ITS VIEW ON OTHER MINISTRIES. BUT GIVEN THEIR PROXIMITY AND TEH DEPTH OF THEIR INVOLVEMENT WITH INDIA, ITS SMALLER NEIGHBORS OFTER FIND THEMSELVES DEALING DIRECTLY WITH OTHER MINISTRIES, OR EVEN WITH STATE GOVERNMENTS. HERE PAROCHIAL INTERESTS COME INTO PLAY AND TEND TO UNDERMINE THE GOOD INTENTIONS OF THE FOREIGN MINISTRY. THUS, THE COMMERCE MINISTRY MAY TAKE A TOUGH LINE WITH BANGLADESH ABOUT SETTLEMENT OF ITS TRADE BALANCES; SRI LANKA FINDS CUSTOMS AND/OR TRADE OFFICIALS TURNING AWAY BOTTLED IMPORTS FROM SRI LANKA BECAUSE THE IMPORT CONTENT IN THE BOTTLE CAPS IS HIGHER THAN THE AGREED LIMIT; NEPAL HAS A LONG LIST OF COM- PLAINTS ABOUT THE CUSTOMS, EXCISE AND STATE TRADING AUTHORITIES. ONE SUSPECTS THE INDIAN BUREAUCRATS IN THESE OTHER MINISTRIES ALSO ARE NOT ALWAYS AS CONSIDERATE OF THE SENSIBILITIES OF THESE SMALLER COUNTRIES AS THEIR FOREIGN MINISTRY COUNTERPARTS. ALL OF THIS GRATES ON PROUD OFFICIALS E E E E E E E E\n",622851

neighborsNepal and Sri Lanka  It also                            added a new member Bangladeshto this group  While India is trying to reassure these countries                            by being correct and even generous in its official dealings with them                            it cannot deny either its overwhelming greater strength or its natural                            involvement in their affairs It does not want to incorporate them into                            India but it feels its security interests require that they should                            remain stable and free from Chinese control It prefers to use the                            carrot rather than the stick to achieve this objective But it has                            intervened forcefully in the affairs of certain of its neighbors in the                            past and all of them are painfully aware of this So long as Indian                            tactics are noninterventionist they are consonant with US policy                            Nevertheless the closeness of the countries specific Indian security                            considerations its selfimage as the dominant power

together will continue to create tensions between India and its smaller                            neighbors END SUMMARY1 Indian Involvement: Given the close ties between India and most of its                            smaller independently minded neighbors friction is almost inevitable                            All have in common a background of participation in the history of the                            geographic region now dominated by India Presentday links vary but are                            close Nepal is landlocked with its only economic access to the rest of                            the world across India Most of its trade is with India Both it and                            Bangladesh have long sievelike borders with India The evolving ties                            between India and Bangladesh reflect India s key role in the  liberation of Bangladesh and its                            postwar assistance to the new a country Various forms of Indian aid                            already spent or programmed total about 330 million trade relations                            are being developed and Bengalis on both sides of the border share a                            common cultural heritage In the case of Sri Lanka the overwhelming                            factor is the disaffected Tamil minority with its racial and possible                            political links to the Tamils in India Trade is not at present a                            factor but negotiations are underway to expand it under state                            direction Bhutan and Burma are exceptions The common border between                            India andBurma lies at the extremity of Indias most isolated region                            and since 1961 Burma has consciously restricted contact with other                            countries including India Bhutan has the potential for becoming                            another but to date the low levels of economic and political                            development in Bhutan and its international isolation have prevented                            this2 Historic Relationships: India has already involved itself in these                            countries Although on occasion eg in Ceylon in 1971 this was on                            behalf of the established government the tendency is to remember                            Instances when India supported interventionin the early 1960s when the                            Nepali Congress Party mounted raids into Nepal from India in 1971 when                            India supported the Bangladesh liberation effort and in 1973 when it                            tightened its grip on its protectorate Sikkim The largest and most                            important of these smaller neighbors Bangladeshobviously welcomed Indian                            intervention Even so historic problems resulting from the close                            physical relationshipproblems left over from the period of                            confrontation under the Pakistan regimeare not proving amenable to                            solution3 Indian Policy: Since 1971 India has sought to reassure its smaller                            neighbors that it accepts and wishes to strengthen the existing state                            system in South Asia It has played down its involvement in the affairs                            of its neighbors has tried to resolve manyold problems and has acted                            effectively and often generously to head off some new ones Indian                            officials have been visiting discussing explaining and giving                            assistance Mrs Gandhi has gone to Kathmandu Dacca Thimphu Bhutan                            and Colombo and her ministers have followed up Discussions with                            Bangladesh have been almost continuous At least some progress seems to                            have been achieved in speeding up implementation of the                            plantationworker Tamils from Sri Lanka in discussing with Sri Lanka                            the question of sovereignty over tiny Kachchitivu Island in joint                            development of the water and hydroelectric resources of Nepal in                            agreeing not to divert the waters of the Ganges at Farakka before                            agreement is reached with Bangladesh and in fresh economic assistance                            for all three countries                             Nevertheless in the context of this overall correct relationship                            there are instances when India feels constrained to lean on its                            neighbors Such pressure has been and is still more likely to fall on                            Nepal than the other small neighbors because of the extreme closeness                            of the physical economic and historic relationship India has always                            been concerned about Chinese aid projects in the portion of Nepal                            bordering India It objected to the Chinese cottongrowing experiment                            there and either has or probably will object to the proposed                            Chineseassisted textile mill Although generally accommodating on the                            aid and trade side recently India has pressed Nepal unsuccessfully to                            agree to joint industrial ventures planning coordination and food                            grain sales by the Nepalese Government to India Finally India applied                            the screws to involve the King to a greater extent in Mrs Gandhis visit to Nepal4 Determining Factors: a Security: Indias main interest in its                            smaller neighbors is security against China This is particularly true                            in the case of Nepal Bangladesh Bhutan and Sikkim any of which would                            provide China with strategic access to the southern side of the                            Himalayas The island of Sri Lanka on the other hand is less of a                            problem and India has historically been willing to tolerate a higher                            level of Chinese involvement there where Chinese access is at the end                            of a long sea route than in the north5  Security against China requires a reasonable stable governments which b are not antiIndia                            Stable governments are also important in Nepal Bangladesh and Bhutan                            because conflict there could easily spill across the open border into                            similar areas of India India prefers democratic governments such as                            those in Bangladesh and Sri Lanka in part because it considers them                            less likely to be antiIndia It is also satisfied with the monarchy in                            Bhutan because it appears stable and friendly for the time being It has                            doubts about the longrun chances of survival of the monarchy in Nepal                            however and about the stability of the government in Bangladesh and Sri                            Lanka It is basically satisfied none of these governments is now repeat                            now pursuing an antiIndian policy although there is abundant                            antiIndian feeling in each country Much of Indian policy toward them                            is intended to serve the dual objective of keeping them from becoming                            antiIndian while helping to maintain at least shortterm stability                            Economic aid to Bangladesh and Nepal for example is intended to keep                            them friendly as well as to help to prevent the economic problems of                            those countries from getting to the point where they would threaten                            order6 While preferring to achieve its objectives by its present approach                            India has not ruled out intervention It allows dissident Nepali                            Congress Party leaders to live in India in part probably because it                            sees some use for them if the monarchy ultimately collapses In Sri                            Lanka in 1971 it helped the government against the insurgents as did                            the United States the Soviet Union and Pakistan Indian officials                            claim they would do so again if asked In 1973 India intervened when the                            situation got out of hand in Sikkim which in any case had never                            achieved the level of independence of the other Himalayan states under                            either the British or India Beyond these instances however Indian                            action will probably depend on circumstances such as the degree of                            threat and the likelihood of wider involvement India would probably                            help Bangladesh at the latters request to subdue a revolt in one                            district A more widespread uprising election of an antiIndian                            government or a broad breakdown of governmental organization and order                            would present difficult choices about which the GOI prefers not to think right now and about which almost                            no Indians appear to have clearly defined ideas7 b Indias Self Image: Talk of Indias dominant position in the area                            raises the hackles of its smaller neighbors India recognizes this and                            protests it is not a power But it cannot deny the fact of its dominance and it expects its                            smaller neighbors to recognize if not acknowledge it One still hears                            occasional talk of possible encirclement of India by its smaller                            neighbors supported by the United States American assistance to these                            countries thus produces an ambivalent Indian reaction India recognizes                            these countries need the assistance but it also recalls that in at                            least one of these countries Nepal the United States no longer sees                            its interests as derivative of its interests in India8 c Domestic Political Pressures: The linkages between India and her                            smaller neighbors have created groups within India with a special                            interest in Indian relations with these countries They articulate these                            interests through the Indian domestic political process Thus Indian                            Congress Party members from areas bordering Nepal press for Indian                            support for the Nepali Congress against the monarchy Indian businessmen                            trading with Nepal lobby in India for their own interests Some West                            Bengalis and other Indian businessmen have both real and sentimental                            interests in reestablishing the semicolonial pre1947 relationship                            between Calcutta and its natural economic and cultural hinterlandnow                            Bangladesh Finally the regional party ruling the South Indian state of                            Tamil Nadu supports the cause of the Tamils in Sri Lanka The GOI appears to be successfully resisting                            these pressures at present Mrs Gandhi stands aloof from the Nepali Congress and the GOI doesnt lend official support even if it deliberately                            or inadvertently fails to catch Nepali Congress perpetrators of last                            years armed attack and the recent hijacking The GOI also severely restricts other travel of                            West Bengalis and other Indian businessmen to Bangladesh in order to                            prevent charges that they are trying to reestablish domination over the                            area It does not support the Tamil autonomistseparatist movement in                            Sri Lanka Pressure on the GOI to change                            these policies may become more insistent however if the clash of                            central and state Interests becomes sharper eg if Bangladesh remains                            adamant against diversion of the Ganges at the Farakka barrage to flush                            out the port of Calcutta or in the competition for votes at election                            time9 d Bureaucratic Differences and Inefficiencies: The correct posture                            represents the position of the Foreign Ministry On important issues it                            is usually able to impose its view on other ministries But given their                            proximity and the depth of their involvement with India its smaller                            neighbors often find themselves dealing directly with other ministries                            or even with state governments Here parochial interests come into play                            and tend to undermine the good intentions of the Foreign Ministry Thus                            the Commerce Ministry may take a tough line with Bangladesh about                            settlement of its trade balances Sri Lanka finds customs andor trade                            officials turning away bottled imports from Sri Lanka because the import                            content in the bottle caps is higher than the agreed limit Nepal has a long list                            of complaints about the customs excise and state trading authorities                            One suspects the Indian bureaucrats in these other ministries also are                            not always as considerate of the sensibilities of these smaller                            countries as their Foreign Ministry counterparts All of this grates on                            proud officials of Nepal Bangladesh and Sri Lanka10 Prospects and US Interests: The official Indian policy is consonant                            with our interest in having a South Asia of stable independent states                            where no outside power has an exclusive position We should recognize                            that there will continue to be instances when as a result of pressures                            on and forces at play within the GOI                            India sends its neighbors signals at variance with the official GOI position Indias relations with her                            smaller neighbors will continue to be marked by periodic flareups                            particularly we believe in the case of relations with Nepal and                            Bangladesh All the smaller neighbors suspect India really wants                            hegemony and indeed it may They react by trying to maintain close                            relations with world powers While we can argue that such relations help                            India by reducing the supersensitivity and increasing the economic                            viability of its neighbors they also decrease Indian leverage over                            these countries This is an ambiguity we must live with We have made                            clear that we are not going to give India a veto over our relations with                            these countries The most we can do is to try to avoid creating                            unnecessary suspicions and to set the Indians straight swiftly  and frankly if they begin                            acting as though we are poaching on their turf11 The big question is Bangladesh which could turn rabidly antiIndian                            This will be depicted as the result of American or SinoAmerican                            intervention We have already raised this point at the highest levels of                            the Indian Government saying dont let it get started but I personally                            question whether any policy or conduct on our part will significantly                            effect the outcome whatever that turns out to be Some destinies are                            just that: destinedMOYNIHAN DPM                                initialed,frus1969-76ve08d145,"1.

neighborsNepal and Sri Lanka  It also                            added a new member Bangladeshto this group  While India is trying to reassure these countries                            by being correct and even generous in its official dealings with them                            it cannot deny either its overwhelming greater strength or its natural                            involvement in their affairs It does not want to incorporate them into                            India but it feels its security interests require that they should                            remain stable and free from Chinese control It prefers to use the                            carrot rather than the stick to achieve this objective But it has                            intervened forcefully in the affairs of certain of its neighbors in the                            past and all of them are painfully aware of this So long as Indian                            tactics are noninterventionist they are consonant with US policy                            Nevertheless the closeness of the countries specific Indian security                            considerations its selfimage as the dominant power

together will continue to create tensions between India and its smaller                            neighbors END SUMMARY1 Indian Involvement: Given the close ties between India and most of its                            smaller independently minded neighbors friction is almost inevitable                            All have in common a background of participation in the history of the                            geographic region now dominated by India Presentday links vary but are                            close Nepal is landlocked with its only economic access to the rest of                            the world across India Most of its trade is with India Both it and                            Bangladesh have long sievelike borders with India The evolving ties                            between India and Bangladesh reflect India s key role in the  liberation of Bangladesh and its                            postwar assistance to the new a country Various forms of Indian aid                            already spent or programmed total about 330 million trade relations                            are being developed and Bengalis on both sides of the border share a                            common cultural heritage In the case of Sri Lanka the overwhelming                            factor is the disaffected Tamil minority with its racial and possible                            political links to the Tamils in India Trade is not at present a                            factor but negotiations are underway to expand it under state                            direction Bhutan and Burma are exceptions The common border between                            India andBurma lies at the extremity of Indias most isolated region                            and since 1961 Burma has consciously restricted contact with other                            countries including India Bhutan has the potential for becoming                            another but to date the low levels of economic and political                            development in Bhutan and its international isolation have prevented                            this2 Historic Relationships: India has already involved itself in these                            countries Although on occasion eg in Ceylon in 1971 this was on                            behalf of the established government the tendency is to remember                            Instances when India supported interventionin the early 1960s when the                            Nepali Congress Party mounted raids into Nepal from India in 1971 when                            India supported the Bangladesh liberation effort and in 1973 when it                            tightened its grip on its protectorate Sikkim The largest and most                            important of these smaller neighbors Bangladeshobviously welcomed Indian                            intervention Even so historic problems resulting from the close                            physical relationshipproblems left over from the period of                            confrontation under the Pakistan regimeare not proving amenable to                            solution3 Indian Policy: Since 1971 India has sought to reassure its smaller                            neighbors that it accepts and wishes to strengthen the existing state                            system in South Asia It has played down its involvement in the affairs                            of its neighbors has tried to resolve manyold problems and has acted                            effectively and often generously to head off some new ones Indian                            officials have been visiting discussing explaining and giving                            assistance Mrs Gandhi has gone to Kathmandu Dacca Thimphu Bhutan                            and Colombo and her ministers have followed up Discussions with                            Bangladesh have been almost continuous At least some progress seems to                            have been achieved in speeding up implementation of the                            plantationworker Tamils from Sri Lanka in discussing with Sri Lanka                            the question of sovereignty over tiny Kachchitivu Island in joint                            development of the water and hydroelectric resources of Nepal in                            agreeing not to divert the waters of the Ganges at Farakka before                            agreement is reached with Bangladesh and in fresh economic assistance                            for all three countries                             Nevertheless in the context of this overall correct relationship                            there are instances when India feels constrained to lean on its                            neighbors Such pressure has been and is still more likely to fall on                            Nepal than the other small neighbors because of the extreme closeness                            of the physical economic and historic relationship India has always                            been concerned about Chinese aid projects in the portion of Nepal                            bordering India It objected to the Chinese cottongrowing experiment                            there and either has or probably will object to the proposed                            Chineseassisted textile mill Although generally accommodating on the                            aid and trade side recently India has pressed Nepal unsuccessfully to                            agree to joint industrial ventures planning coordination and food                            grain sales by the Nepalese Government to India Finally India applied                            the screws to involve the King to a greater extent in Mrs Gandhis visit to Nepal4 Determining Factors: a Security: Indias main interest in its                            smaller neighbors is security against China This is particularly true                            in the case of Nepal Bangladesh Bhutan and Sikkim any of which would                            provide China with strategic access to the southern side of the                            Himalayas The island of Sri Lanka on the other hand is less of a                            problem and India has historically been willing to tolerate a higher                            level of Chinese involvement there where Chinese access is at the end                            of a long sea route than in the north5  Security against China requires a reasonable stable governments which b are not antiIndia                            Stable governments are also important in Nepal Bangladesh and Bhutan                            because conflict there could easily spill across the open border into                            similar areas of India India prefers democratic governments such as                            those in Bangladesh and Sri Lanka in part because it considers them                            less likely to be antiIndia It is also satisfied with the monarchy in                            Bhutan because it appears stable and friendly for the time being It has                            doubts about the longrun chances of survival of the monarchy in Nepal                            however and about the stability of the government in Bangladesh and Sri                            Lanka It is basically satisfied none of these governments is now repeat                            now pursuing an antiIndian policy although there is abundant                            antiIndian feeling in each country Much of Indian policy toward them                            is intended to serve the dual objective of keeping them from becoming                            antiIndian while helping to maintain at least shortterm stability                            Economic aid to Bangladesh and Nepal for example is intended to keep                            them friendly as well as to help to prevent the economic problems of                            those countries from getting to the point where they would threaten                            order6 While preferring to achieve its objectives by its present approach                            India has not ruled out intervention It allows dissident Nepali                            Congress Party leaders to live in India in part probably because it                            sees some use for them if the monarchy ultimately collapses In Sri                            Lanka in 1971 it helped the government against the insurgents as did                            the United States the Soviet Union and Pakistan Indian officials                            claim they would do so again if asked In 1973 India intervened when the                            situation got out of hand in Sikkim which in any case had never                            achieved the level of independence of the other Himalayan states under                            either the British or India Beyond these instances however Indian                            action will probably depend on circumstances such as the degree of                            threat and the likelihood of wider involvement India would probably                            help Bangladesh at the latters request to subdue a revolt in one                            district A more widespread uprising election of an antiIndian                            government or a broad breakdown of governmental organization and order                            would present difficult choices about which the GOI prefers not to think right now and about which almost                            no Indians appear to have clearly defined ideas7 b Indias Self Image: Talk of Indias dominant position in the area                            raises the hackles of its smaller neighbors India recognizes this and                            protests it is not a power But it cannot deny the fact of its dominance and it expects its                            smaller neighbors to recognize if not acknowledge it One still hears                            occasional talk of possible encirclement of India by its smaller                            neighbors supported by the United States American assistance to these                            countries thus produces an ambivalent Indian reaction India recognizes                            these countries need the assistance but it also recalls that in at                            least one of these countries Nepal the United States no longer sees                            its interests as derivative of its interests in India8 c Domestic Political Pressures: The linkages between India and her                            smaller neighbors have created groups within India with a special                            interest in Indian relations with these countries They articulate these                            interests through the Indian domestic political process Thus Indian                            Congress Party members from areas bordering Nepal press for Indian                            support for the Nepali Congress against the monarchy Indian businessmen                            trading with Nepal lobby in India for their own interests Some West                            Bengalis and other Indian businessmen have both real and sentimental                            interests in reestablishing the semicolonial pre1947 relationship                            between Calcutta and its natural economic and cultural hinterlandnow                            Bangladesh Finally the regional party ruling the South Indian state of                            Tamil Nadu supports the cause of the Tamils in Sri Lanka The GOI appears to be successfully resisting                            these pressures at present Mrs Gandhi stands aloof from the Nepali Congress and the GOI doesnt lend official support even if it deliberately                            or inadvertently fails to catch Nepali Congress perpetrators of last                            years armed attack and the recent hijacking The GOI also severely restricts other travel of                            West Bengalis and other Indian businessmen to Bangladesh in order to                            prevent charges that they are trying to reestablish domination over the                            area It does not support the Tamil autonomistseparatist movement in                            Sri Lanka Pressure on the GOI to change                            these policies may become more insistent however if the clash of                            central and state Interests becomes sharper eg if Bangladesh remains                            adamant against diversion of the Ganges at the Farakka barrage to flush                            out the port of Calcutta or in the competition for votes at election                            time9 d Bureaucratic Differences and Inefficiencies: The correct posture                            represents the position of the Foreign Ministry On important issues it                            is usually able to impose its view on other ministries But given their                            proximity and the depth of their involvement with India its smaller                            neighbors often find themselves dealing directly with other ministries                            or even with state governments Here parochial interests come into play                            and tend to undermine the good intentions of the Foreign Ministry Thus                            the Commerce Ministry may take a tough line with Bangladesh about                            settlement of its trade balances Sri Lanka finds customs andor trade                            officials turning away bottled imports from Sri Lanka because the import                            content in the bottle caps is higher than the agreed limit Nepal has a long list                            of complaints about the customs excise and state trading authorities                            One suspects the Indian bureaucrats in these other ministries also are                            not always as considerate of the sensibilities of these smaller                            countries as their Foreign Ministry counterparts All of this grates on                            proud officials of Nepal Bangladesh and Sri Lanka10 Prospects and US Interests: The official Indian policy is consonant                            with our interest in having a South Asia of stable independent states                            where no outside power has an exclusive position We should recognize                            that there will continue to be instances when as a result of pressures                            on and forces at play within the GOI                            India sends its neighbors signals at variance with the official GOI position Indias relations with her                            smaller neighbors will continue to be marked by periodic flareups                            particularly we believe in the case of relations with Nepal and                            Bangladesh All the smaller neighbors suspect India really wants                            hegemony and indeed it may They react by trying to maintain close                            relations with world powers While we can argue that such relations help                            India by reducing the supersensitivity and increasing the economic                            viability of its neighbors they also decrease Indian leverage over                            these countries This is an ambiguity we must live with We have made                            clear that we are not going to give India a veto over our relations with                            these countries The most we can do is to try to avoid creating                            unnecessary suspicions and to set the Indians straight swiftly  and frankly if they begin                            acting as though we are poaching on their turf11 The big question is Bangladesh which could turn rabidly antiIndian                            This will be depicted as the result of American or SinoAmerican                            intervention We have already raised this point at the highest levels of                            the Indian Government saying dont let it get started but I personally                            question whether any policy or conduct on our part will significantly                            effect the outcome whatever that turns out to be Some destinies are                            just that: destinedMOYNIHAN DPM                                initialed,frus1969-76ve08d145,"1.

neighborsNepal and Sri Lanka  It also                            added a new member Bangladeshto this group  While India is trying to reassure these countries                            by being correct and even generous in its official dealings with them                            it cannot deny either its overwhelming greater strength or its natural                            involvement in their affairs It does not want to incorporate them into                            India but it feels its security interests require that they should                            remain stable and free from Chinese control It prefers to use the                            carrot rather than the stick to achieve this objective But it has                            intervened forcefully in the affairs of certain of its neighbors in the                            past and all of them are painfully aware of this So long as Indian                            tactics are noninterventionist they are

together will continue to create tensions between India and its smaller                            neighbors END SUMMARY1 Indian Involvement: Given the close ties between India and most of its                            smaller independently minded neighbors friction is almost inevitable                            All have in common a background of participation in the history of the                            geographic region now dominated by India Presentday links vary but are                            close Nepal is landlocked with its only economic access to the rest of                            the world across India Most of its trade is with India Both it and                            Bangladesh have long sievelike borders with India The evolving ties                            between India and Bangladesh reflect India s key role in the  liberation of Bangladesh and its                            postwar assistance to the new a country Various forms of Indian aid                            already spent or programmed total about 330 million trade relations                            are being developed and Bengalis on both sides of the border share a                            common cultural heritage In the case of Sri Lanka the overwhelming                            factor is the disaffected Tamil minority with its racial and possible                            political links to the Tamils in India Trade is not at present a                            factor but negotiations are underway to expand it under state                            direction Bhutan and Burma are exceptions The common border between                            India andBurma lies at the extremity of Indias most isolated region                            and since 1961 Burma has consciously restricted contact with other                            countries including India Bhutan has the potential for becoming                            another but to date the low levels of economic and political                            development in Bhutan and its international isolation have prevented                            this2 Historic Relationships: India has already involved itself in these                            countries Although on occasion eg in Ceylon in 1971 this was on                            behalf of the established government the tendency is to remember                            Instances when India supported interventionin the early 1960s when the                            Nepali Congress Party mounted raids into Nepal from India in 1971 when                            India supported the Bangladesh liberation effort and in 1973 when it                            tightened its grip on its protectorate Sikkim The largest and most                            important of these smaller neighbors Bangladeshobviously welcomed Indian                            intervention Even so historic problems resulting from the close                            physical relationshipproblems left over from the period of                            confrontation under the Pakistan regimeare not proving amenable to                            solution3 Indian Policy: Since 1971 India has sought to reassure its smaller                            neighbors that it accepts and wishes to strengthen the existing state                            system in South Asia It has played down its involvement in the affairs                            of its neighbors has tried to resolve manyold problems and has acted                            effectively and often generously to head off some new ones Indian                            officials have been visiting discussing explaining and giving                            assistance Mrs Gandhi has gone to Kathmandu Dacca Thimphu Bhutan                            and Colombo and her ministers have followed up Discussions with                            Bangladesh have been almost continuous At least some progress seems to                            have been achieved in speeding up implementation of the                            plantationworker Tamils from Sri Lanka in discussing with Sri Lanka                            the question of sovereignty over tiny Kachchitivu Island in joint                            development of the water and hydroelectric resources of Nepal in                            agreeing not to divert the waters of the Ganges at Farakka before                            agreement is reached with Bangladesh and in fresh economic assistance                            for all three countries                             Nevertheless in the context of this overall correct relationship                            there are instances when India feels constrained to lean on its                            neighbors Such pressure has been and is still more likely to fall on                            Nepal than the other small neighbors because of the extreme closeness                            of the physical economic and historic relationship India has always                            been concerned about Chinese aid projects in the portion of Nepal                            bordering India It objected to the Chinese cottongrowing experiment                            there and either has or probably will object to the proposed                            Chineseassisted textile mill Although generally accommodating on the                            aid and trade side recently India has pressed Nepal unsuccessfully to                            agree to joint industrial ventures planning coordination and food                            grain sales by the Nepalese Government to India Finally India applied                            the screws to involve the King to a greater extent in Mrs Gandhis visit to Nepal4 Determining Factors: a Security: Indias main interest in its                            smaller neighbors is security against China This is particularly true                            in the case of Nepal Bangladesh Bhutan and Sikkim any of which would                            provide China with strategic access to the southern side of the                            Himalayas The island of Sri Lanka on the other hand is less of a                            problem and India has historically been willing to tolerate a higher                            level of Chinese involvement there where Chinese access is at the end                            of a long sea route than in the north5  Security against China requires a reasonable stable governments which b are not antiIndia                            Stable governments are also important in Nepal Bangladesh and Bhutan                            because conflict there could easily spill across the open border into                            similar areas of India India prefers democratic governments such as                            those in Bangladesh and Sri Lanka in part because it considers them                            less likely to be antiIndia It is also satisfied with the monarchy in                            Bhutan because it appears stable and friendly for the time being It has                            doubts about the longrun chances of survival of the monarchy in Nepal                            however and about the stability of the government in Bangladesh and Sri                            Lanka It is basically satisfied none of these governments is now repeat                            now pursuing an antiIndian policy although there is abundant                            antiIndian feeling in each country Much of Indian policy toward them                            is intended to serve the dual objective of keeping them from becoming                            antiIndian while helping to maintain at least shortterm stability                            Economic aid to Bangladesh and Nepal for example is intended to keep                            them friendly as well as to help to prevent the economic problems of                            those countries from getting to the point where they would threaten                            order6 While preferring to achieve its objectives by its present approach                            India has not ruled out intervention It allows dissident Nepali                            Congress Party leaders to live in India in part probably because it                            sees some use for them if the monarchy ultimately collapses In Sri                            Lanka in 1971 it helped the government against the insurgents as did                            the United States the Soviet Union and Pakistan Indian officials                            claim they would do so again if asked In 1973 India intervened when the                            situation got out of hand in Sikkim which in any case had never                            achieved the level of independence of the other Himalayan states under                            either the British or India Beyond these instances however Indian                            action will probably depend on circumstances such as the degree of                            threat and the likelihood of wider involvement India would probably                            help Bangladesh at the latters request to subdue a revolt in one                            district A more widespread uprising election of an antiIndian                            government or a broad breakdown of governmental organization and order                            would present difficult choices about which the GOI prefers not to think right now and about which almost                            no Indians appear to have clearly defined ideas7 b Indias Self Image: Talk of Indias dominant position in the area                            raises the hackles of its smaller neighbors India recognizes this and                            protests it is not a power But it cannot deny the fact of its dominance and it expects its                            smaller neighbors to recognize if not acknowledge it One still hears                            occasional talk of possible encirclement of India by its smaller                            neighbors supported by the United States American assistance to these                            countries thus produces an ambivalent Indian reaction India recognizes                            these countries need the assistance but it also recalls that in at                            least one of these countries Nepal the United States no longer sees                            its interests as derivative of its interests in India8 c Domestic Political Pressures: The linkages between India and her                            smaller neighbors have created groups within India with a special                            interest in Indian relations with these countries They articulate these                            interests through the Indian domestic political process Thus Indian                            Congress Party members from areas bordering Nepal press for Indian                            support for the Nepali Congress against the monarchy Indian businessmen                            trading with Nepal lobby in India for their own interests Some West                            Bengalis and other Indian businessmen have both real and sentimental                            interests in reestablishing the semicolonial pre1947 relationship                            between Calcutta and its natural economic and cultural hinterlandnow                            Bangladesh Finally the regional party ruling the South Indian state of                            Tamil Nadu supports the cause of the Tamils in Sri Lanka The GOI appears to be successfully resisting                            these pressures at present Mrs Gandhi stands aloof from the Nepali Congress and the GOI doesnt lend official support even if it deliberately                            or inadvertently fails to catch Nepali Congress perpetrators of last                            years armed attack and the recent hijacking The GOI also severely restricts other travel of                            West Bengalis and other Indian businessmen to Bangladesh in order to                            prevent charges that they are trying to reestablish domination over the                            area It does not support the Tamil autonomistseparatist movement in                            Sri Lanka Pressure on the GOI to change                            these policies may become more insistent however if the clash of                            central and state Interests becomes sharper eg if Bangladesh remains                            adamant against diversion of the Ganges at the Farakka barrage to flush                            out the port of Calcutta or in the competition for votes at election                            time9 d Bureaucratic Differences and Inefficiencies: The correct posture                            represents the position of the Foreign Ministry On important issues it                            is usually able to impose its view on other ministries But given their                            proximity and the depth of their involvement with India its smaller                            neighbors often find themselves dealing directly with other ministries                            or even with state governments Here parochial interests come into play                            and tend to undermine the good intentions of the Foreign Ministry Thus                            the Commerce Ministry may take a tough line with Bangladesh about                            settlement of its trade balances Sri Lanka finds customs andor trade                            officials turning away bottled imports from Sri Lanka because the import                            content in the bottle caps is higher than the agreed limit Nepal has a long list                            of complaints about the customs excise and state trading authorities                            One suspects the Indian bureaucrats in these other ministries also are                            not always as considerate of the sensibilities of these smaller                            countries as their Foreign Ministry counterparts All of this grates on                            proud officials of Nepal Bangladesh and Sri Lanka10 Prospects and US Interests: The official Indian policy is consonant                            with our interest in having a South Asia of stable independent states                            where no outside power has an exclusive position We should recognize                            that there will continue to be instances when as a result of pressures                            on and forces at play within the GOI                            India sends its neighbors signals at variance with the official GOI position Indias relations with her                            smaller neighbors will continue to be marked by periodic flareups                            particularly we believe in the case of relations with Nepal and                            Bangladesh All the smaller neighbors suspect India really wants                            hegemony and indeed it may They react by trying to maintain close                            relations with world powers While we can argue that such relations help                            India by reducing the supersensitivity and increasing the economic                            viability of its neighbors they also decrease Indian leverage over                            these countries This is an ambiguity we must live with We have made                            clear that we are not going to give India a veto over our relations with                            these countries The most we can do is to try to avoid creating                            unnecessary suspicions and to set the Indians straight swiftly  and frankly if they begin                            acting as though we are poaching on their turf11 The big question is Bangladesh which could turn rabidly antiIndian                            This will be depicted as the result of American or SinoAmerican                            intervention We have already raised this point at the highest levels of                            the Indian Government saying dont let it get started but I personally                            question whether any policy or conduct on our part will significantly                            effect the outcome whatever that turns out to be Some destinies are                            just that: destinedMOYNIHAN DPM                                initialed,frus1969-76ve08d145,"1.

GOP MADE EXTENSIVE EFFORTS TO ENSURE THAT HIS RECEPTION HERE WAS WARM AND USEFUL.

    INITIATED AT BEGINNING OF HIS PRESIDENCY AND WHICH PROVED SO PRODUCTIVE                            THEN IS WISEST POSSIBLE COURSESECRET ROGERS ,frus1969-76ve08d7,"1. SATTAR BEGAN HIS PRESENTATION BY SAYING THAT THE PAKISTAN DELEGATION WAS DOUBTFUL THAT THE IDEAS IT HAS PUT FORTH TO INDIA CAN BE GOTTEN ACROSS TO THE GOVERNMENT OF BANGLADESH IN TIME FOR THE CURRENT NEGOTIATIONS TO BE CONCLUSIVE. HE THEN DESCRIBED THE STATE OF PLAY OF THE NEGOTIATIONS AS FOLLOWS:    A. THE GOVERNMENT OF PAKISTAN HAS INDICATED THAT IT IS PREPARED TO AGREE WITH INDIA THAT ALL BENGALEES COULD LEAVE PAKISTAN. THAT IS, THE 203 WOULD NOT BE HELD BACK. IT HAS ALSO AGREED THAT 195 PRISONERS OF WAR COULD REMAIN IN INDIA ""FOR THE TIME BEING"". THE GOVERNMENT OF INDIA IS PREPARED TO AGREE THAT ""THE 195 POWS WILL REMAIN IN INDIA DURING THE ENTIRE PROCESS OF REPATRIATION OF THE BALANCE OF THE POWS (SATTAR SAID THIS WOULD BE ABOUT FOUR MONTHS). THEREAFTER THERE WOULD BE A TRILATERAL MEETING OF INDIA, PAKISTAN, AND BANGLADESH TO DISCUSS DISPOSITION OF THE 195 POWS"".    B. SATTAR EXPLAINED PAKISTAN HAD TWO PROBLEMS WITH THIS PROPOSAL. FIRST, BANGLADESH WOULD RETAIN A VETO ON THE FINAL DECISION REGARDING WHAT WAS DONE ABOUT THE 195 POWS. WHILE PERHAPS THE GOP COULD GET AN AGREEMENT THAT THE 195 WOULD REMAIN IN INDIA UNTIL THEIR FUTURE IS SETTLED, BANGLADESH WOULD BE ABLE SIMPLY NOT RPT NOT TO MAKE A DECISION ON THE POWS AND THE 195 COULD BE ""BURIED ALIVE IN INDIA"". CONSEQUENTLY THE PAKISTAN DELEGATION HAS SOUGHT INFORMAL ASSURANCE THAT THIS SITUATION WOULD NOT DEVELOP. AZIZ AHMED ASKED PRIME MINISTER GANDHI IF SHE COULD STATE HER OPINION THAT THIS OUTCOME WOULD NOT COME TO PASS AND SAY THAT SHE WOULD USE HER INFLUENCE TO ACHIEVE AN EXPEDITIOUS SETTLEMENT OF THE QUESTION OF WHAT TO DO ABOUT THE 195.    C. THE SECOND PAKISTAN PROBLEM ACCORDING TO SATTAR RELATED TO THE NUMBER OF POWS HELD BACK. SINCE THE GOP WAS PREPARED TO RELEASE ALL BANGALEES IT ASKED THE GOI IF THE NUMBER OF POWS COULD BE CUT BACK DRASTICALLY FROM 195 (SATTAR HAD THE NUMBER OF FIFTY IN MIND). ACCORDING TO SATTAR THE GOI (BUT NOT BANGLA- DESH) AGREES THAT THERE SHOULD BE NO WAR CRIMES TRIALS. IN VIEW THEREFORE OF THE MUTUAL INDIAN AND PAKISTAN OBJECTIVE TO AVOID TRIALS, THE GOP APPEALED TO MRS. GANDHI TO INTERCEDE CONFIDENTIAL WITH DACCA TO REDUCE THE NUMBER.    D. IN RESPONSE TO THESE TWO POINTS PRIME MINISTER GANDHI HAS REPLIED THAT THE GOI WOULD NOT RPT NOT ASK MUJIB EITHER TO REDUCE THE NUMBER OF POWS HELD BACK OR TO GIVE THE GOP AN ASSURANCE EVEN OF A GENERAL NATURE REGARDING EARLY SETTLEMENT OF WHAT TO DO ABOUT THE 195. THE INDIANS HAVE SAID THAT THIS IS A MATTER FOR BANGLADESH TO DECIDE UPON.    E. SATTAR SAID THAT IN VIEW OF LACK OF PROGRESS IN THE NEGOTIATIONS PRIME MINISTER BHUTTO DECIDED IN HIS DISCUSSIONS WITH AGHA SHAHI OVER THE WEEKEND THAT A MORE COMPREHENSIVE APPROACH SHOULD BE TRIED. ACCORDINGLY A NEW PACKAGE WAS PRESENTED TO PRIME MINISTER GANDHI BY AZIZ AHMED ON AUGUST 26. THE GOP PROPOSED: THAT ALL PRISONERS OF WAR WOULD BE RELEASED (I.E., NONE WILL BE HELD BACK FOR POSSIBLE TRIALS); ALL BANGALEES WOULD LEAVE PAKISTAN; IN EXCHANGE FOR THE ABOVE PAKISTAN WOULD RECOGNIZE BANGLADESH NOW (SATTAR EXPLAINED BY THIS THAT HE DID NOT MEAN IMMEDIATELY. BHUTTO WOULD HAVE TO CONSULT POLITICAL LEADERS IN PAKISTAN FIRST. BUT RECOGNITION WOULD COME BEFORE ALL POWS HAD LEFT INDIA); THE GOP WOULD DROP ITS OPPOSITION TO THE ADMISSION OF BANGLADESH TO THE UNITED NATIONS; PAKISTAN WOULD BE PREPARED TO ACCEPT SOME 70,000 TO 75,000 BIHARIS WHO WERE HARDSHIP CASES AND WOULD CONSIDER A FURTHER IMPROVEMENT OF THIS FIGURE SO LONG AS THERE WAS NOT A ONE- TO-ONE EXCHANGE OF BANGLAEES AND BIHARIS.    F. IN RESPONSE TO THE PAKISTAN PROPOSAL INDIAN DELEGATION LEADER HAKSAR SAID THAT HE CONSIDERED IT ""OLD WINE IN NEW CUPS"". AZIZ AHMED DIFFERED SAYING THAT IT WAS RADICALLY NEW. INSTEAD OF WAITING TO SETTLE THE 195 QUESTION LATER AND HAVE RECOGNITION THEN, THE ENTIRE TIMETABLE WOULD BE ADVANCED.\n2. SATTAR EXPLAINED THAT THE TWO GOP PROPOSALS REMAINED BEFORE THE GOI. IN REGARD TO THE FIRST, HE CONSIDERED THE BIHARI QUESTION COULD BE WORKED OUT. SWARAN SINGH HAD TOLD AZIZ AHMED THAT THERE WAS A DIFFERENCE OF 20,000 TO 30,000 BETWEEN THE BANGLADESH AND PAKISTAN POSITIONS REGARDING BIHARIS. IF THIS WAS TRUE SATTAR BELIEVED A COMPROMISE POSSIBLE. THEREFORE THE POW QUESTION WAS NOW THE MAJOR POINT AT ISSUE. ASKED IF A TRILATERAL MEETING WOULD REQUIRE PRIOR GOP RECOGNITION, SATTAR REPLIED THAT THE LANGUAGE BEING CONSIDERED STATES THAT SQSH A MEETING WOULD TAKE PLACE ""ON THE BASIS OF SOVEXPZXGC\n3. IN REGARD TO THE SECOND PROPOSAL SATTAR SAID SINCE HAKSARS FIRST REACTION HAD BEEN TO DISMISS IT, THE GOP IS CONCERNED THAT DACCA MAY NOT GIVE BHUTTOS NEW PROPOSAL THE CONSIDERATION IT DESERVES. THE GOP HAS GIVEN ALL IT CAN. THE PAKISTAN DELEGATION IS ALSO WORRIED ABOUT LACK OF TRUST BETWEEN DACCA AND NEW DELHI, I.E., THE BENGALESE FEAR THAT THE INDIANS WILL CONFIDENTIAL SELL THEM DOWN THE RIVER. CONSEQUENTLY BANGLADESH MAY DISMISS THE NEW BHUTTO PROPOSAL ""OUT OF HAND"".\n4. CONSEQUENTLY PAKISTAN DELEGATION LEADER AZIZ AHMED ASKED THAT THE US PRESENT BHUTTOS NEW PROPOSAL TO THE GOVERNMENT OF BANGLADESH. SATTAR SAID THE GOP ASKS THAT IF THE US CANNOT COMMEND THE PLAN IT SHOULD SET IT FORTH IN DETAIL. THE DCM REPLIED THAT HE WOULD REPORT THE GOP REQUEST TO WASHINGTON AND SEEK INSTRUCTIONS. HE POINTED OUT THAT AS SATTAR WAS AWARE, THE USG SUPPORTED THESE NEGOTIATIONS BUT HAD SCRUPULOUSLY AVOIDED BECOMING INVOLVED. HE ALSO POINTED OUT THAT THE POLITICAL RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE US AND BANGLADESH WAS UNCERTAIN.\n5. SATTAR CONCLUDED IF DACCAS RESPONSE IS UNFAVORABLE AND THE GOI FIRMLY ADHERES TO ITS PRESENT POSITION, THE GOP WILL HAVE TO DECIDE WHETHER OR NOT TO ACCEPT ALTERNATIVE ONE IN THE FORM TO WHICH INDIA HAD AGREED. SATTAR DID NOT RULE OUT THE POSSI- BILITY THAT BHUTTO MIGHT ACCEPT THIS PROPOSAL. ALTERNATELY, THE TALKS MIGHT END AND FURTHER CONSIDERATION BE GIVEN TO THE ISSUES BEFORE RESUMPTION OF DISCUSSIONS.\n6. SATTAR SAID TWO FURTHER NEGOTIATING SESSIONS WERE SCHEDULED FOR TODAY, AUGUST27, AND THERE WAS A PROJECT FOR ADDITIONAL TALKS AUGUST 28. THE NEGOTIATIONS MAY BREAK UP AFTER AUGUST 28 ALTHOUGH AZIZ AHMED IS NOT PLANNING TO LEAVE FOR THIS TRIP TO PEKING, MOSCOW, ANKARA AND TEHRAN UNTIL AUGUST 30. THERE IS STILL THEREFORE SOME FLEXIBILITY REGARDING DISCUSSIONS AFTER THE 28TH.\n7. COMMENT: WHILE WE ARE NOT IN A POSITION TO JUDGE THE FACTORS IN PAKISTAN AND BANGLADESH WHICH BEAR ON THIS PAKISTANI REQUEST, OUR STRONG INCLINATION IS FOR US IN DELHI STAY OUT OF THESE NEGOTIATIONS. WE BELIEVE THE INDIANS WILL CLEARLY SET FORTH THE LATEST PAKISTANI PROPOSAL IN DACCA. THE GOI HAS BEEN SENDING FREQUENT COURIERS TO DACCA TO KEEP THE BANGLADESH GOVERNMENT INFORMED ON NEGOTIATIONS. AS THE DCM POINTED OUT THE SATTAR, THE GOP ALL-AT-ONCE APPROACH SEEMS TO BE MORE ABRUPT ON THE WAR CRIME TRIALS ISSUE THAT ANYTHING MUJIB COULD ACCEPT. WE QUESTION THEREFORE THAT IT WOULD BE IN OUR INTEREST TO ASSOCIATE OURSELVES WITH IT.\n8.  ACTION REQUESTED: WE REQUEST THE DEPARTMENTS INSTRUCTIONS REGARDING A RESPONSE TO SATTAR. ALSO URGENTLY REQUEST COMMENTS BY EMBASSIES DACCA AND ISLAMABAD REGARDING GOP REQUEST.\n2.\n",623067

I WELCOMED DEPARTMENTS INTENTION TO CONVEY TO DAUD OUR CONCERN OVER IMPLICATIONS OF A POLICY OF CONFRONTATION WITH PAKISTAN, AND I REGRET THAT DEPART- MENTS INSTRUCTION THAT SUBJECT (STATE 164400) HAS NOW BEEN WATERED DOWN. FOR REASONS SKETCHED OUT IN ISLAMA- BAD REFTEL, I FEAR THAT DAUDS APPROACH, ESPECIALLY AS OUTLINED TO SENATOR PERCY, COULD BE SOMETHING OF A TIMEBOMB. AT THIS JUNCTURE WHEN INDIA, BANGLADESH AND PAKISTAN ARE EXPLORING POSSIBILITIES FOR RESOLVING THE MOST URGENT QUESTIONS REMAINING FROM 1971 WAR, THIS REGION NEEDS THE PROSPECT OF HOT CONFRONTATION CONFIDENTIAL BETWEEN AFGHANISTAN AND PAKISTAN LIKE A HOLE IN THE HEAD. I THEREFORE THOUGHT THE DEPART- MENTS INTENTION TO MAKE THIS CLEAR TO DAUD WAS NOT ONLY WELL CONCEIVED BUT WELL TIMED.\n2. I HAD INTENDED PUT ABOVE VIEWS TO DEPARTMENT SEVERAL DAYS AGO BUT WAS DELAYED BECAUSE OF PREOCCUPATION WITH FLOOD-RELATED ACTIVITIES. ON MY RETURN TO ISLAMABAD THIS MORNING (AUG 23), I MET WITH YUSUF BUCH, A SPECIAL ASSISTANT TO PRIMIN BHUTTO, AT BUCHS REQUEST. HE SAID PRIMIN, WHO NOW IN FLOODED REGION, HAD ASKED HIM TO SPEAK WITH ME ABOUT AFGHANISTAN SITUATION. BHUTTO SAID HE MUCH APPRECIATED ASSISTANT SECRETARY SISCOS COMMENT TO AMB SULTAN KHAN THAT HE INTENDED TO TELL AFGHAN AMB IN WASHINGTON OF OUR STRONG HOPE THAT GOA WILL KEEP COOL ON PUSHTUNISTAN ISSUE. BHUTTO ALSO RECALLED THAT SISCO HAD TOLD SULTAN KHAN, AFTER DAUDS REQUEST FOR OUR GOOD OFFICES ON BALUCH ARRESTS, THAT WE HAVE NO DESIRE TO GET IN MIDDLE ON THIS MATTER (STATE 164399). BHUTTO WANTED ME TO KNOW HIS FEELING THAT IF USG EVEN LENDS AN EAR TO AFGHAN DEMARCHES OF THIS TYPE, IT WILL ENCOURAGE GOA TO THINK IT CAN DO MORE THAN MERELY MAKE DEMARCHES; IT MAY MISLEAD GOA TO BELIEVE USG SHARES KABULS DIS- APPROVING VIEW OF GOP ACTIONS. BHUTTO HOPES THAT USG WILL MAINTAIN POSITION THAT WE WILL NOT ENCOURAGE ANY INTERFERENCE BY KABUL IN PAKISTANS INTERNAL AFFAIRS OR ANY ATTEMPT BY KABUL TO CREATE TURBULENCE ON SO- CALLED PUSHTUNISTAN ISSUE.\n3. I TOLD BUCH WE SHARED GOPS DESIRE TO AVOID TURBULENCE IN REGION. AS SISCO HAD TOLD SULTAN KHAN, WE DID NOT WANT TO GET IN THE MIDDLE BETWEEN AFGHANISTAN AND PAKISTAN BUT THAT DID NOT MEAN WE WOULD LIIK WITH EQUANIMITY ON HEATING UP OF ISSUE WHICH COULD THREATEN INTERNATIONAL STABILITY IN THE AREA. AS FOR BHUTTOS SPECIFIC COMMENTS AND SUGGESTIONS TO US, I WOULD REPORT THEM PROMPTLY. I ADDED THAT PERSONALLY I SHARED SOME OF GOPS CONCERN.\n4. I BELIEVE IT IN OUR INTEREST TO LEAVE GOA IN NO AMBIGUITY ON DIMNESS WITH WHICH WE WOULD VIEW AN ACTIVIST CONFIDENTIAL KABUL POLICY STIRRING UP PUSHTUNISTAN ISSUE. I HOPE WE CAN FIND SOME WAY TO MAKE THIS CLEAR WITHOUT BRINGING IN POINTS THAT MIGHT HAVE COUNTER-PRODUCTIVE EFFECT ANTICIPATED BY AMB NEUMANN. IT WOULD SEEM BETTER TO LEAVE DAUD IN NO DOUBT ON THIS SUBJECT WHILE RELA- TIONS BETWEEN PAKISTAN AND AFGHANISTAN ARE STILL REA- SONABLY GOOD RATHER THAN RISK WAITING UNTIL A CANDID EXPRESSION OF OUR CONCERN MIGHT BE TOO LATE TO AVERT TROUBLE.\n5. I OUGHT TO BE ABLE RESPOND TO PRIMIN BHUTTO ON HIS SUGGESTIONS THIS SUBJECT, AND WOULD WELCOME DEPART- MENTS GUIDANCE. SOBER\n",621071

    INITIATED AT BEGINNING OF HIS PRESIDENCY AND WHICH PROVED SO PRODUCTIVE                            THEN IS WISEST POSSIBLE COURSESECRET ROGERS ,frus1969-76ve08d7,"1. SINCE JULY THE ECONOMIC SITUATION IN PAKISTAN HAS UNDERGONE MAJOR CHANGES PRIMARILY AS RESULT OF THE STILL ACTIVE FLOODS AFFECTING MAJOR PORTIONS OF THE PUNJAB AND SIND. THUS, WE ANTICIPATE THAT PRIMIN WILL TAKE A SOMEWHAT DIFFERENT LINE IN HIS DISCUSSIONS IN WASHINGTON THAN HE MIGHT HAVE IN JULY. WE KNOW THAT PRIMINS BRIEFING HAS NOT YET BEEN PREPARED BY HIS OWN STAFF AND THEREFORE AT THIS STAGE CAN ONLY TENTATIVELY SUGGEST WHAT MAY BE ON HIS AGENDA. LIMITED OFFICIAL USE\n2. FOOD AND FERTILIZER: SINCE JULY WORLDWIDE FOOD PICTURE HAS TIGHTENED AT SAME TIME THAT RELATIVELY OPTIMISTIC PAKISTANI OUTLOOK HAS BEEN REVERSED. EXCELLENT HARVEST OF ESTIMATED 7.5 MILLION TONS, COUPLED WITH VIGOROUS GOVERNMENT PROCUREMENT EFFORT ACCUMULATING\n1.3 MILLION TONS FROM PAKISTANS OWN CROP TO BE AVAIL- ABLE FOR FAIR PRICE RATION SHOPS, WAS GOING TO PERMIT PAKISTAN TO GET BY EVEN WITH MINIMUM PL 480 AVAILABILITIES. WHILE GOVERNMENT ESTIMATES OF PRIVATE WHEAT STOCK LOSS FROM FLOOD IN NEIGHBORHOOD ONE MILLION TONS MAY BE HIGH, IT IS CLEAR THAT THE GOVERNMENT HAS A NEW PROBLEM WITH REQUIREMENT FOR INCREASED RATION SHOP OFFTAKE TO FEED DEVASTATED AREAS. FREE MARKET WHEAT PRICES HAVE SHOT UP, IN SOME AREAS, BECAUSE OF TRANSPORTATION CONSTRAINTS, TO DOUBLE PRE-FLOOD LEVELS. US PRESIDENTIAL ANNOUNCE- MENT THAT WE ARE PROVIDING 100,000 TONS MAY WELL HELP GOVERNMENT COUNTER SPECULATION IN WHEAT MARKET. HOWEVER, BHUTTO IS SURE TO SEEK HIGHEST AMERICAN PRIORITY FOR PAK FOOD REQUIREMENTS. SIMILARLY, WITH LOSS OF COTTON CROP SOMEWHERE BETWEEN 500,000 AND 1,000,000 BALES, IMPLYING A LOSS OF 25,000 TO 50,000 TONS OF COTON SEED OIL, PAKISTAN WILL BE LOOKING FOR VEGETABLE OIL ON AN URGENT BASIS. PARTICULARLY IN LIGHT OF WORLDWIDE FOOD SHORTAGES WHICH WILL MAKE IT IMPOSSIBLE FOR THE US TO PROVIDE ANYTHING LIKE THE AMOUNTS OF FOOD PAKISTAN FEELS IT REQUIRES, PAKISTAN WILL BE SEEKING MORE FERTILIZER TO HELP IT PRODUCE ITS OWN FOOD. WE BELIEVE THESE ITEMS WILL HAVE A HIGHER PRIORITY ON THE PRIME MINISTERS AGENDA IN SEPTEMBER THAN WAS PROBABLY THE CASE IN JULY.\n3. REHABILITATION: PAKISTAN IS STILL ASSESSING THE FOOD DAMAGES BUT WE ALREADY KNOW THAT PERHAPS TEN MILLION PEOPLE ARE AFFECTED, THAT MAJOR DAMAGE HAS BEEN DONE TO CANAL, TRANSPORTATION AND COMMUNICATION SYSTEMS, AND THAT LARGE PORTION OF EFFORT WHICH WAS INTENDED FOR NEW DEVELOPMENT WILL NOW GO INTO REHABILITATION. PAKISTAN IS LIKELY TO SEEK AUGMENTED FUNDS FROM INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY TO HELP WITH RECOVERY. PRIMIN IN PUBLIC STATEMENTS HERE HAS BEEN CAREFUL NOT TO EXAGGERATE HOW MUCH DAMAGE HAS BEEN DONE, SPEAKING OF THE FLOOD AS A LIMITED OFFICIAL USE\n4. DEBT: WITH THE SHORT-TERM DEBT RESCHEDULING AGREE- MENT OUT OF THE WAY, PAKISTAN IS TURNING ITS ATTENTION TO QUESTION OF LONG-TERM DEBT RESCHEDULING, PARTICULARLY TO REMOVE THE PAYMENTS HUMP WHICH LOOMS IN THE FIVE YEARS AHEAD. BECAUSE OUR AID DIRECTED TO THE THE FORMER PROVINCE OF EAST PAKISTAN WAS LARGELY IN THE FORM OF FOOD AND COMMODITY ASSISTANCE, PAKISTAN LOOKS TO US TO TAKE THIS INTO ACCOUNT IN CONSIDERING THE AMOUNT OF LONG-TERM DEBT RESCHEDULING WE WILL SUPPORT. WE BELIEVE THAT THE PRIMIN WILL LOOK FOR ASSURANCES FROM THE US THAT WE WILL APPROACH THE UPCOMING LONG-TERM DEBT NEGOTIATIONS WITH AN ATTITUDE OF GENEROSITY.\n5. ECONOMIC IMPLICATIONS OF THE SETTLEMENT WITH INDIA AND BANGLADESH: A PARTICULARLY DIFFICULT AREA TO ASSESS IS THE POSSIBLE CALL ON INTERNATIONAL RESOURCES IMPLICIT IN PAKISTANS AGREEMENT IN PRINCIPLE TO ABSORB LARGE NUMBERS OF ""NON-BENGALI MUSLIMS"" FROM BANGLADESH. WE ALSO ARE UNAWARE OF WHAT CALLS MAY BE MADE FOR SPECIAL TRANSPORTATION FACILITIES IN CONNECTION WITH REPATRIATION OF PRISONERS IN INDIA AND BENGALIS IN PAKISTAN. WE NOTE MUJIBUR RAHMANS REQUEST FOR USG HELP. AT THIS POINT WE CAN ONLY FLAG THIS AS AN AREA WHICH COULD BECOME AN AGENDA ITEM BY THE TIME OF THE PRIMINS VISIT.\n6. WATER LOGGING AND SALINITY: IN LIGHT OF THE ABOVE, WE SPECULATE THAT WATER LOGGING AND SALINITY MAY BECOME A LESS IMPORTANT ECONOMIC SUBJECT THAN WAS EARLIER ANTICIPATED. IT WILL BE RECALLED THAT THE PRIMIN TOLD US THAT THIS WOULD BE HIS PRINCIPAL SUBJECT AREA ON THE ECONOMIC SIDE. BY SEPTEL WE WILL PROVIDE COMMENTS ON THE WATER LOGGING AND SALINITY PAPER CONTAINED IN THE EARLIER BRIEFING BOOK. LIMITED OFFICIAL USE\n7. WE EXPECT THAT MEETINGS WITH PRESIDENT NIXONS REPRESENTATIVE, MAURICE WILLIAMS, NEXT WEEK WILL GIVE US MORE INSIGHT INTO THE AREAS LIKELY TO BE EMPHASIZED IN PRIMINS TALKS IN WASHINGTON. FURTHERMORE, BY THE END OF NEXT WEEK, IT SHOULD BE POSSIBLE TO COME UP WITH MORE DEFINITIVE ASSESSMENTS OF FLOOD DAMAGE AND RESULTANT ECONOMIC REQUIREMENTS. SOBER\n",619112

I ACCOMPANIED CONGRESSMAN LESTER WOLFF FOR A CALL ON PRESIDENT PARK AUGUST 24.  IN THE COURSE OF CONVERSATION, WOLFF NOTED THE GREAT ATTENTION BEING PAID TO THE KIM TAE CHUNG CASE IN THE U.S. AND JAPAN AND ASKED PRESIDENT PARK FOR HIS COMMENTS ON THE SUBJECT. PARK SAID HE WAS AWARE OF THE HIGHLY CRITICAL COMMENTS BEING MADE ABROAD ABOUT THIS MATTER.  THE ROKG IMAGE WAS SUFFERING BADLY AS A RESULT.  HE SAID HE WAS NOT HAPPY THAT KIM WAS ABDUCTED BECAUSE HE REALIZES THE DISADVANTAGES FOR HIS GOVERNMENT.\n2. PARK SAID HE DID NOT WANT TO BE SPECIFIC IN HIS COMMENTS BECAUSE THE MATTER WAS UNDER INVESTIGATION AND HE WISHED TO SECURE ALL THE FACTS BEFORE MAKING AN OFFICIAL STATEMENT.  HE CONSIDERED THERE WERE THREE POSSIBILITIES: A) THE NORTH KOREANS OR THEIR AGENTS MAY HAVE DONE IT; B) SOME AGENCY OF THE ROKG COULD HAVE CARRIED IT OUT; AND C) KIM TAE-CHUNG HIMSELF COULD HAVE CONFIDENTIAL HAD THE IDEA IN ORDER TO DRAMATIZE HIS POSITION.  AS OF NOW ALL COMMENT ABROAD WAS ACCEPTING THE FACT THAT IT WAS AN AGENCY OF HIS GOVERNMENT WHICH WAS GUILTY.  THE ONLY WAY TO ANSWER THIS WAS TO COMPLETE A THOROUGH INVESTIGATION AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE.  HE APPRECIATED THE NEED FOR QUICK ACTION OTHERWISE THE DISADVANTAGES FOR HIS GOVERNMENT, WHICH ALREADY EXISTED, WOULD BE MULTIPLIED.\n3. PARK SAID HE HAD RESTRICTED ACCESS KIM TAE CHUNG IN RECENT DAYS DESPITE REQUESTS OF JAPANESE PARLIAMENTARIANS, LOCAL AND FOREIGN PRESS AND OTHER INDIVIDUALS WHO WISHED TO SEE KIM TAE CHUNG.  WHEN KIM HAD FIRST RETURNED TO KOREA THE GOVERNMENT HAD ALLOWED HIM FREE ACCESS AND AS A RESULT HE WAS CONSTANTLY IN TOUCH WITH VARIOUS POLITICAL AND NEWS FIGURES AND WAS NOT COOPERATING WITH THOSE WHO HAD BEEN CHARGED TO INVESTIGATE THE CASE. IN FACT EVEN NOW KIM WAS NOT COOPERATING FULLY WITH THE INVESTIGATION.  SO FOR THE TIME BEING, IN AN EFFORT TO ACCELERATE THE INVESTIGATION, KIM WAS AT HOME, NOT UNDER ARREST BUT VISITORS WERE BEING KEPT AWAY.  PARK REPEATED THAT THIS WAS FOR QUOTE THE TIME BEING ONLY UNQUOTE.\n4. COMMENT: WOLFF HAD INDICATED TO ME THAT HE INTENDED TO RAISE THIS QUESTION WITH PARK AND I TOLD HIM TO FEEL FREE TO DO SO.  THE PRESIDENTS COMMENTS WERE PREDICTABLE.  HE TOOK GREAT PAINS TO EXPLAIN HIMSELF TO WOLFF WHICH IS CLEAR INDICATION HE REALIZES HOW BADLY THE CASE APPEARS TO THOSE ABROAD.  NEVERTHELESS, HIS EXPLANATION LEFT A GREAT DEAL TO BE DESIRED.  AS I EXPECTED, HE LIMITED HIS COMMENTS USING THE INVESTIGATION THAT IS UNDERWAY AS JUSTIFICATION.  HE DID, HOWEVER, RECOGNIZE THE NEED TO MOVE QUICKLY IN THE FACT OF THE GENERALLY UNFAVORABLE REACTION WITH WHICH HIS GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN FACED. THIS IS A POINT I HAVE BEEN MAKING TO A NUMBER OF HIS CLOSE ADVISORS WHENEVER THEY RAISE THE QUESTION OF THE INVESTIGATION WITH ME.  PARK GAVE NO HINT AS TO HOW HE WILL HAVE THAT INVESTIGATION TURN OUT BUT THEN I DID NOT EXPECT HIM TO HAVE YET DECIDED HOW TO SETTLE THE CONFIDENTIAL MATTER WITH LEAST FURTHER DAMAGE TO HIS POSITION.

AS SUMMARIZED BY HK ANALYSTS, PROBLEMS SEEM TO BE THAT CITY YOUTHS DO NOT LIKE LIVING OR WORKING IN COUNTRY, FREQUENTLY DO NOT EARN ENOUGH TO LIVE ON -- EITHER BECAUSE THEY DO NOT WORK ENOUGH OR BECAUSE LOCAL AUTHORITIES ARBITRARILY PAY THEM LESS THAN REGULAR FARMERS -- AND LOCAL OFFICIALS FAIL TO PROVIDE ADEQUATE TRAINING, HOUSING, STUDY MATERIALS, AND RECREATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES.

S-NS BRADSHER (AUG. 8) IN SAIGON NOTES SURFACING OF PROBLEMS IN NVN AS HANOI SHIFTS GEARS TO WIN CONTROL OOOF SVN.  QUOTES SOME FOREIGN OBSERVERS AS BELIEVING THAT PROBLEMS  MAINLY ECONOMIC  HAVE SIGNIFICANTLY WORSENED WITH THE END OF FIGHTING AND BOMBING.  PERSONS WHO FOLLOW NVN AFFAIRS CLOSELY, HOWEVER, SAY IT IS MORE A CHANGE OF CLIMATE THAN OF ACTUALITIES, OBSERVING THAT CHRONIC PROBLEMS ARE NOW MORE NOTICED AND DISCU SSED WITH THE EXCUSE OF WARTIME CONDITIONS REMOVED.  THEY SAY THAT NVN HAS ALWAYS HAD PROBLEMS OF ILLEGAL PRIVATE UNCLASSIFIED  TRADING TO SUPPLEMENT INADEQUATE GOVERNMENT ARRANGEMENTS, OR FALSIFICATION OF ECON STATISTICS AND SIMILAR   THINGS WHICH ARE NOW PROMINENT AGAIN. THERE IS, HOWEVER, NEW ATTENTION TO IMPROVING THE ECONOMY. ON  INTERNATIONAL FRONT, NVN IS HAVING DISPUTES WITH THE USSR, HANOIS LARGEST BENEFACTOR, AND TO A LESSER DEGREE, WITH CHINA.  WITH RESPECT TO USSR, CITES REPORTS THAT SINCE LE DUAN AND PHAM VAN DONGS TALKS WITH USSR OFFICIALS IN MOSCOW LAST MONTH, SOVIET  OFFICIALS AND MILITARY OFFICERS IN NVN HAVE BEEN GIVEN THE COLD SHOULDER.  THEY HAVE EVEN BEEN BARRED FROM VISITING SOME ANTI-AIRCRAFT EFENSES THEY BUILT FOR NVN.  \n3.  GLOBE (AUG. 8) EXPRESSING VIEW THAT SATURATION BOMBING OF VN BROUGHT AT BEST A STALEMATE, THAT HALF A DECADE OF CAMBODIA BOMBING IS COMING TO AN END WITH NEARLY 90 OF LAND IN COMMUNIST HANDS, SAYS, ""IT IS ALL OVER IN SOUTHEAST ASIA- EXCEPT FOR THE BOMBING....THE BOMBING OUGHT TO STOP TOO, WITHOUT WAITING ANOTHER GHASTLY WEEK.""  \n4.  LONDON FINANCIAL TIMES (SN AUG 8) OBSERVES SURGE IN PRC STEEL CONSUMPTION.  CITES OFFICIAL REPORT THAT 1972 TOTAL STEEL PRODUCTION WAS 23 MILLION TONS, UP 9.5 OVER 1971- A DROP IN THE\n1.  ATTRIBUTES DROP TO GREATER INSISTENCE ON QUALITY AND DIFFICULTY OF KEEPING UP A FAST RATE OF EXPANSION ONCE SPARE CAPACITY IS ALMOST TAKEN UP.  CITES CURRENT CHINESE  REPORTS AS SUGGESTING THAT PRESENT RATE OF EXPANSION IS PROBABLY SAME AS LAST YEARS.  OBSERVES THAT DOMESTIC STEEL PRODUCTION IS SUPPLEMENTED BY IMPORTS; IN FIRST HALF OF973, IMPORTS FROM JAPAN ALONE WERE EXPECTED TO REACH 2 MILLION TONS.  IF DOMESTIC STEEL OUTPUT REACHES   26 MILLION TONS THIS YEAR, ESTIMATES THAT TOTAL CONSUMPTION WILL BE AT LEAST\n5.  CSM SUGGESTS THAT COMMUNIST SIDE MAY WELL OBJECT TO IRAN JOINING ICCS BECAUSE OF HER CLOSE US ALIGNMENT AND GROWING MILITARY POWER THROUGH HUGE PURCHASES OF US WEAPONS.  APPOINTMENT ALSO MIGHT WELL BE VIEWED AS AFFRONT BY INDIA.  EVEN IF ACCEPTED, ""IT IS DOUBTFUL WHETHER IRAN OR ANY OTHER SUITABLE CANDIDATE COULD SUPPLY THE NECESSARY DYNAMISM TO MAKE THE COMMISSION THE STRONG, EFFECTIVE ORGANIZATION IT OUGHT TO BE."" THUS, CEASE-FIRE WILL DEPEND ON OPPOSING SIDES IN VN CONFLICT, AND LATEST REPORTS OF RENEWED FIGHTING ARE NOT ENCOURAGING.  \n6.  KRAFT (WP, SUN) ARGUES THAT IT DOESNT MATTER VERY MUCH WHETHER CAMBODIA GOES COMMUNIST.  ""BY ITSELF, CAMBODIA IS UNIMPORTANT,"" IS ALMOST ENTIRELY UNDEVELOPED, ITS 6 MILLION PEOPLE THREATEN NOBODY, AND REGIME IS ""UNLOVED AND INCOMPETENT.""  EVEN IF COMMUNIST REGIME TOOK OVER, ""IT WOULD BE DIVIDED IN CHARACTER.""  GAINING ALL OF CAMBODIA WOULD ONLY MARGINALLY IMPROVE TASK OF SUPPLYING NVA IN SVN THAT NVN ALREADY SEEMS TO HAVE WELL IN HAND.  KRAFT CONCEDES THAT CAMBODIAS FALL MIGHT HAVE PSYCHOLOGICAL IMPACT IN SVN, CAUSING GVN AND ARVN TO COME APART AND EASING HANOIS DRIVE TOWARD UNIFYING VN; BUT US ""ALREADY HAS DONE MORE THAN STAND BY ITS COMMITMENTS"" TO GVN, AND IF IT CANNOT STAND ON ITS OWN FEET, BLAME CANNOT BE PLACED ON US.  KRAFT MAINTAINS CAMBODIA BOMBING HAS FAILED TO STOP CAMBODIAS COLLAPSE AND HAS BROUGHT DEATH TO THOUSANDS OF INNOCENT PEOPLE.  ""WORST OF ALL,"" NIXON ADMINISTRATION HAS BASED CAMBODIA BOMBING POLICY ON ""DECEPTION, NOT TO SAY LYING, AT HOME"" AND BECAUSE OF THIS IT ""NOW HAS NO PUBLIC SUPPORT, NO LEGITIMACY, FOR THE USE OF FORCE"" IN VN.  INSISTS THAT HONEST GOVERNMENT IN WSHINGTON IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN FRIENDLY GOVERNMENT UNCLASSIFIED  IN PP -- AND ""IF THAT MEANS LETTING GO IN CAMBODIA AND THE REST OF SOUTHEAST ASIA, THE PRICE IS SMALL.""\n7.  LOU HARRIS SURVEY FINDS MAJORITY (64 -22) FAVORS CONGRESS CUTTING OFF ALL MONEY FOR US MILITARY OPS IN CAMBODIA AFTER AUG. -5.  BUT WHEN ASKED HOW THEY WOULD REACT IF PRES. REQUESTS 30-DAY EXTENSION, PLURALITY (45 - 43) FAVORS GIVING HIM MORE TIME TO NEGOTIATE SETTLEMENT.  HARRIS SEES RESULTS SIGNIFICANT AS ILLUSTRATING THAT PUBLIC BELIEF IN NIXONS ABILITY TO HANDLE FOREIGN POLICY HAS REMAINED RELATIVELY HIGH, DESPITE WATERGATE.  SAYS THIS IS CONFIRMED BY OTHER HARRIS POLLS SHOWING 60 - 29 POSITIVE   RATING FOR PRES. ON HANDLING RELATIONS WITH PRC, AND EVEN HIGHER (68 - 30) RATING ON ""WORKING FOR PEACE.""  SURVEY FINDS THAT ALTHOUGH DIVISIONS ARE RELATIVELY CLOSE AMONG ALL GROUPS, PATTERNS OF ATTITUDES ON EXTENSION OF CAMBODIA BOMBING PARALLEL SCHISMS THAT PLAGUED US THROUGHOUT VN WAR.  OPPOSITION TO ANY EXTENSION CAN BE FOUND AMONG THE YOUNG, BEST EDUCATED, DEMOCRATS AND INDEPENDENTS.  SUPPORT FOR EXTENSION RUNS STRONGEST AMONG OLDER PEOPLE, THE LEAST WELL EDUCATED AND REPUBLICANS (WP, CHITRIB).  \n8.  CDN (AUG. 6) SAYS THAT WITH WATERGATE, FORCES ARE IN MOTION THAT WILL AFFECT CONDUCT OF PRESIDENCY FOR MANY YEARS.  SEES, AS LATEST MANIFESTATION OF THIS MOOD IN CONGRESS, PROPOSED LAWS TO LIMIT PRESIDENTIAL WAR POWERS, BUT INSISTS US NEEDS STRONG LEADER IN 20TH CENTURY.  ""SURELY WE SHOULD NOT TOLERATE A GOVERNMENT THAT BOMBS CAMBODIA WHILE SAYING THAT IT IS NOT.  BUT JUST AS SURELY WE NEED A GOVERNMENT THAT IS FREE TO RESPOND TO THE OPPORTUNITY FOR A HISTORIC SHIFT IN RELATIONS WITH CHINA, WITHOUT HAVING TO CLEAR EVERY MOVE WITH CONGRESS.""  NATIONS GUIDANCE MUST COME FROM PRESIDENTIAL MORAL PERCEPTION OF WHAT IS RIGHT AND WHAT IS POPULAR WILL AND NEED.  FEARS ATMOSPHERE UNCLASSIFIED  OF MUTUAL TRUST AND  RESPECT NECESSARY FOR LEADER TO FUNCTION IN A DEMOCRACY HAS BEEN SHATTERED, AND ITS RESTORATION WILL TAKE LONG TIME.  ROGERS\n",610911

ON UNCURK, GOS FAVORS ""A DECENT BURIAL"" FOR THE INSTITUTION AND CONSIDERS THAT AN UNCURK MEMBERS RECOMMENDATION TO DISSOLVE MEETS THAT CRITERION.  ON UNC, GOS APPRECIATES DANGERS OF GETTING UP HEAD OF STEAM TO ABOLISH IT WITHOUT HAVING ADEQUATE SUBSTITUTE MEANS OF MAINTAINING THE ARMISTICE AND INSURING STABILITY IN THE AREA.  RYDBECK HINTED, HOWEVER, THAT GOS WOULD SUPPORT GA RESOLUTION CALLING UPON SC TO STUDY POSSIBLE ALTERNA- TIVE TO EXISTING ARMISTICE EDIFICE.  HE SAID IN ANY EVENT A UN PRESENCE IN KOREA WOULD HAVE TO BE RETAINED. GOS WOULD OPPOSE AN UNGA RESOLUTION CALLING ON SC SIMPLY TO ABOLISH UNC.  RYDBECK SAID HE BELIEVES ATTITUDE OF CHINA WILL DETERMINE HOW KOREA ISSUE DEVELOPS IN 28TH UNGA AND SAID SWEDEN DOES NOT KNOW WHAT CHINESE ATTITUDE WILL BE.\n3.  ON DIPLOMAT-PROTECTION CONVENTION, GOS WILL SUPPORT HIGH PRIORITY FOR THIS ITEM ON SIXTH COMITE AGENDA.  ON TERRORISM, GOS SHARES OUR PESSIMISM THAT 28TH UNGA WILL ACCOMPLISH MUCH AND WONDERS WHETHER WE HAVE ANY INITIA- TIVES IN MIND TO GET MOVEMENT ON CONCRETE MEASURES OR, AT LEAST, TO PREVENT AD HOC COMITE FROM BECOMING SEMI- PERMANENT INSTITUTION.\n4.  ON NON-USE OF FORCE AND HUMAN RIGHTS, GOS SEES THESE AS LINKED PSYCHOLOGICALLY IN THAT 28TH UNGA IS LIKELY TO SEE SOVIET AND WESTERN CAMPS RE-PLAYING THEIR CSCE RECORDS. RYDBECK SAID 27TH UNGAS NON-USE-OF-FORCE RESOLUTION MAY NOT GET A REPRISE BUT SOVIETS WOULD BE SURE THEN TO COME UP WITH SOMETHING LIKE IT AND IT WOULD RING FAMILIAR TO THOSE WHO WERE AT HELSINKI CONFERENCE.  GOS STRONGLY SUPPORTS DRAFTING OF A DECLARATION ON ELIMINATION OF ALL FORMS OF RELIGIOUS INTOLERANCE.\n5.  ON WDC, SWEDES AGREED WITH OUR VIEW THAT SPECIAL COMMITTEE COULD NOT SUBMIT REPORT TO UNGA SINCE IT HAD NEVER MET FORMALLY.  RYDBECK HOPED THAT SIMPLY TAKING NOTE OF SPECIAL COMMITTEES I CAPACITY WOULD BE THE END CONFIDENTIAL OF WDC FOR 28TH UNGA.  HE SAID THERE WAS SOME INDEPENDENT REASON FOR OPTIMISM, TO WIT:  A NON-ALIGNED DIPLOMAT TOLD HIM THAT, AT KABUL MEETING WHERE AGENDA FOR ALGIERS NON-ALIGNED CONFERENCE WAS FIXED, WDC WAS STRICKEN FROM THE PROPOSED AGENDA.  THE REASON, HE SAID, WAS THAT NON-ALIGNEDS DID NOT WISH TO BE MADE TO CHOOSE SIDES IN A CHINA-USSR CONFLICT.\n6.  ON UNGA DELEGATION (REF C) SWEDES SAID THEY EXPECTED DELEGATION WOULD BE HEADED BY FOREIGN MINISTER REGARDLESS OF OUTCOME OF SEPTEMBER 16 ELECTIONS.  IF THERE IS A NEW MINISTER, RYDBECK SAID, HE WOULD SURELY WISH TO STEP ON WORLD STAGE ASAP.  IN ANY EVENT SWEDISH FOREIGN MINISTER IS INSCRIBED FOR OCT. 2 AND OCT. 9.\n7.  FOREIGN MINISTERS OF FIVE NORDIC COUNTRIES WILL MEET HERE OCT. 30 FOR ONE-DAY GO-AROUND ON UNGA ISSUES. ORN AGREED TO BACKGROUND AND ELABORATE FOR ME ON THE COMMUNIQUE AFTERWARD.  OLSEN\n",623451

ACTING PRINCIPAL OFFICER WILEY AND USINTOFF HOUGHTON CALLED ON MFAS HEAD OF INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS SECTION OMRAN SHAFII AUGUST 23 TO DISCUSS ISSUES RAISED REFTEL.  SAFII WAS ACCOMPANIED DURING TALKS BY HIS DEPUTY, OMAR SIRRI, AND OTHER OF HIS SECTIONS DESK OFFICERS.  FOLLOWING PARAGRAPHS SUMMARIZE GOE POSITION REGARDING ITEMS OF CONCERN IN UNGA DEBATE.\n2.  KOREA:  SIRRI AND SHAFII ASKED IF ROK HAD DROPPED PRIOR CONDITIONS TO DPRKS PARTICIPATION IN UN, I.E., THAT DPRK ACCEPT CONTINUATION OF UN COMMAND.  SHAFII EXPLAINED THAT, EVEN THOUGH ROK WOULD NOT OBJECT TO DPRK PARTICIPATION IN DEBATE OR IN INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS, EGYPTS POSITION REGARDING UNC WAS THAT IT SHOULD BE DISBANDED.  ON QUESTION OF FULL MEMBERSHIP IN UN, SHAFII SAID THAT ACTION IN THIS REGARD SHOULD WAIT FOR RECOMMENDATION BY UNSC; UNTIL SUCH TIME, GOE WOULD NOT CONFIDENTIAL TAKE POSITION.\n3.  CONVENTION ON PROTECTION OF DIPLOMATS:  GOE WISHES TO CONTRIBUTE TO DISCUSSION ON CONVENTION, BUT WANTS TO HAVE ISSUE ""DISCUSSED WITHIN CONTEXT OF ALL RELATED MATTERS""--I.E., UNGA SHOULD ALSO DISCUSS ISSUES OF INDIVIDUAL, GROUP, AND STATE TERRORISM, AS WELL AS THEIR UNDERLYING CAUSES.  SHAFII DID NOT ACCEPT US VIEW THAT CAUSES AND ACTIONS SHOULD BE TREATED AS SEPARATE ISSUES. HE INDICATED THAT TERRORISM BY STATES WOULD BE MUCH ON GOES MIND IN THIS REGARD.\n4.  TERRORISM:  SEE ABOVE PARAGRAPH.\n5.  WORLD DISARMAMENT CONFERENCE (WDC):  SIRRI STATED THAT GOE POSITION REMAINS ESSENTIALLY UNCHANGED FROM PAST YEARS: IT APPROVES OF WDC IN PRINCIPLE ON CONDITION THAT ALL NUCLEAR POWERS PARTICIPATE.\n6.  NON-USE OF FORCE (NUF):  GOE VOTED FOR LAST YEARS NUF RESOLUTION, AND WOULD VIEW FAVORABLY UNGA DISCUSSION ON NUF AS A WAY OF STRENGTHENING UN MECHANISM.\n7.  NAPALM AND OTHER INCENDARIES:  GOE HAS NOT FULLY DEVELOPED STANCE ON THIS.  BOTH SHAFII AND SIRRI APPEARED TO FOCUS ON QUESTION OF WHICH COMMITTEE WOULD CONSIDER QUESTION.  THEY PROMISED TO CONTACT US LATER WHEN THEY HAVE FULLER GOE POSITION.\n8.  MIDDLE EAST:  SHAFII AND SIRRI TOOK EXPECTED, STRONG POSITION ALONG GOES WELL-KNOWN LINE.  DURING COURSE OF\n9.  AFRICAN ISSUES:  (A) RHODESIA.  GOE TAKES VIEW THAT US HAS SPECIAL ROLE AS PERMANENT MEMBER OF SC TO IMPLEMENT ALL SC RESOLUTIONS, INCLUDING THOSE CALLING FOR SANCTIONS AGAINST RHODESIA.  (B)  PORTUGUESE LIBERATION MOVEMENTS: WHILE TAKING NOTE OF US POSITION, GOE BELIEVES THAT ALL PORTUGUESE LIBERATION MOVEMENTS SHOULD BE PERMITTED TO PARTICIPATE IN UN DELIBERATIONS ACCORDING TO WISHES OF UNGA.  SHAFII AND SIRRI HAD NO SPECIFIC COMMENT ON RESOLUTIONS OF OSLO CONFERENCE.\n0.  HUMAN RIGHTS:  GOE WOULD SUPPORT GENERAL PRINCIPLE OF FREEDOM OF RELIGION AND OBJECTIVE TREATMENT OF HUMAN RIGHTS QUESTIONS.  IT WOULD, HOWEVER, GIVE SPECIAL ATTENTION TO QUESTION OF FREEDOM OF MOVEMENT, PARTICULARLY INSOFAR AS THIS REGARDS FREEDOM OF RETURN OF REFUGEES. SIRRI ASKED SPECIFICALLY WHAT US POSITION WOULD BE REGARDING DISCUSSION ON IMPLEMENTATION OF THE FOURTH GENEVA CONVENTION ON PROTECTION OF CIVILIANS IN OCCUPIED TERRITORIES.\n1.  FINANCIAL PROBLEMS:  SHAFII AND SIRRI APPEARED TO ACCEPT US POSITION THAT 25 PERCENT ASSESSMENT ISSUE SHOULD NOT BE REOPENED.  BOTH TOOK PARTICULAR NOTE OF HARMFUL EFFECTS OF DOLLAR DEVALUATION ON SUBSIDIARY PROGRAM ACTIVITIES OF UN IN REGARD TO LDCS.  IN EFFECT, DEVALUATION HAD CREATED PROBLEMS FOR UN PROGRAMS WHICH NOW HAD SMALLER CASH RESOURCES THAN THEY HAD ANTICIPATED.\n2.  ECOSOC:  GOE FEELS THAT 28TH UNGA IS OPPORTUNE TIME FOR REVIEW OF IDS.  REGARDING SUBSTANCE, GOE WOULD LIKE US TO TAKE NOTE OF FACT THAT CONTRIBUTIONS OF DEVELOPING COUNTRIES AS PERCENTAGE OF THEIR TOTAL WEALTH IS DECREASING. US HAS SPECIAL RESPONSIBILITY TO INCREASE ITS OWN CONTRIBU- TIONS.  GOE ALSO FEELS THAT DEVELOPED COUNTRIES USE OF PREFERENCE SYSTEM WAS TOO MUCH TO THEIR SELF-ADVANTAGE IN PROMOTING TRADE, AND TOO RESTRICTIVE IN REGARD TO LDCS.  RESULT IS FURTHER DECREASE IN LDCS RESOURCES, CONFIDENTIAL AND THIS SHOULD BE RECTIFIED.\n3.  SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY:  GOE POSITION WAS NOT SUFFICIENTLY DEVELOPED ON THIS ISSUE TO PERMIT MORE THAN EXPRESSION OF GENERAL ATTITUDE THAT GOE IS OPPOSED TO PROLIFERATION OF UN SPECIALIZED AGENCIES.\n4.  SAHELIAN ZONES:  SHAFII NOTED US CONTRIBUTIONS TO DRAUGHT-STRICKEN COUNTRIES.  HE STATED THAT GOE HAS CONTRIBUTED TO THEIR RELIEF ON BILATERAL BASIS.\n5.  COMMENT:  IN GENERAL, GOE APPEARS TO BE HOLDING TO PREVIOUS POSITIONS.  REGARDING NEW SUBJECTS, KOREA QUESTION IS ONE TO WHICH GOE HAS CLEARLY GIVEN MUCH ATTENTION.  GOE HAS NOT YET DEVELOPED DETAILED POSITIONS ON SEVERAL OF THE MORE TECHNICAL ISSUES.  ALTHOUGH GOES VIEWS ARE AT VARIANCE WITH THOSE OF US ON MANY MATTERS OF IMPORTANCE AT UPCOMING UNGA, DISCUSSIONS WITH USINTOFFS WERE HELD IN CONSTRUCTIVE ATMOSPHERE, MADE UNEVEN ONLY BY SHAFII MONOLOGUE ON ME QUESTION.\n6.  WOULD APPRECIATE US POSITION ON GENEVA CONVENTION ON PROTECTION OF CIVILIANS IN OCCUPIED TERRITORIES TO PASS TO SHAFII ON HIS RETURN FROM ALGIERS CONFERENCE. WILEY\n",610063

CHOE AND HAM EXPLAINED ROKG EXTREMELY CONCERNED ABOUT PROSPECTS FOR UNGA SUPPORT OF UNC CONTINUATION. BY HIS RECENT CALCULATIONS, CHOE SAID WE PROBABLY NOW ONLY HAVE ABOUT A FOUR-VOTE MARGIN LEFT TO PLAY WITH. THIS IS MUCH TOO CLOSE. CONSEQUENTLY, ROKG HOPES THAT USG CAN,IN DEALINGS WITH PRC, WORK OUT SOME ARRANGEMENT WHEREBY AT MINIMUM ROK ADMISSION TO UN CAN BE ASSURED IN EXCHANGE FOR UNC TERMINATION.\n4. BOTH MEN EMPHASIZED THAT ROKG MUST HAVE SOMETHING TO SHOW AFTER UNGA. IF NORTH KOREANS PARTICIPATE IN UNGA DEBATE, UNCURK IS TERMINATED, AND THERE IS UNFAVORABLE UNGA RESOLUTION ON UNC, CHOE SAID IT IS CLEAR THAT ROK WILL HAVE SUFFERED A COMPLETE DEFEAT DIPLOMATICALLY. TO AVOID THIS THEY REITERATED THAT ROKG IS WILLING TO TRADE UNC FOR UN ADMISSION. ALSO INDICATED THAT USG AND ROKG SHOULD AT SOME POINT CONSIDER OTHER POSSIBLE OPTIONS TO AVOID AN OPEN UNGA DEFEAT ON UNC QUESTION, IN EVENT WE DETERMINE ""THE VOTES ARE NOT THERE"".\n5. IN RESPONSE TO CHOES AND HAMS COMMENTS, AMBASSADOR SAID THAT WE BELIEVE IT IS PREMATURE TO ENGAGE IN SPECULATION ABOUT WHAT WILL HAPPEN IN UNGA REGARDING UNC. SAID WE CONTINUE TO BELIEVE THAT AT THIS POINT IN TIME BEST COURSE FOR ALL OF US IS TO EMPHASIZE ""SIMULTANEOUS ADMISSION"" PROPOSAL OF ROKG AND IN THAT CONTEXT URGE OTHER NATIONS TO SUPPORT CONTINUATION OF UNC. AMBASSADOR SAID WE REMAIN HOPEFUL THAT OUR VALID ARGUMENTS REGARDING IMPORTANCE OF UNC IN TERMS OF STABILITY AND SECURITY ON PENINSULA, PARTICULARLY AS REGARDS ARMISTICE AGREEMENT, WILL PROVE EFFECTIVE.
