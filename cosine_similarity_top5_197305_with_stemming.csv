       Shah was shocked over scurrilous contents of this issue and disturbed that                        country with which Iran has such close relations could permit publication of                        this type of yellow journalism which full of libelous irresponsible and                        inaccurate statements2 In reply Charg said that he fully agreed with Nadims description of this                        publication with its disgraceful contents that we have been exploring with                        Washington for some time whether action could be taken against Iran Free Press but without success so far and that                        Shahs views as reported by Nadim would be promptly relayed to Washington                        He suggested MFA might wish instruct                        Ambassador Zahedi to make same points                        to Department to underscore Shahs concern Meanwhile we expected                        momentarily reply to questions regarding Nasser Afshar which MFA had put to us as reported in Ref A and B                        Ref C arrived after this meeting3 Comment: Sheltered as he is by local conventions                        and practices from any criticism Shah has always been sensitive to critical                        comments directed against him or his regime As he gains in stature and                        selfconfidence he is increasingly sensitive and finds it more and more                        difficult to understand democratic practices in countries like US and                        Germany which he sees as overly permissive and which appear to tolerate and                        condone antiIranian activities and personal attacks on Shah Relations                        between Iran and Germany in recent years have several times been strained                        because of such developments but during same period we have been spared                        Imperial unhappiness over occasional antiIranian demonstration in US or                        activities of persons like Nasser Afshar and his Iran Free                            Press As suggested in Ref A Shah has apparently decided not to                        ignore any further antiShah elements in US and given close relations                        between two countries he apparently hopes we can do something about people                        like Afshar before his forthcoming visit to US4 In this context Ref C is helpful in answering specific questions about                        Afshar but we believe we also need more general message which will massage                        Shahs sensitivities and put Iran Free Press and                        Afshar in proper perspective In responding to MFA queries we will draw on Ref C but we would also like to be                        able to say that matter has been considered on several occasions at high                        levels of USG and that USG deeply deplores yellow journalism                        represented by Iran Free Press and totally                        disassociates itself from this publication Further because of our close                        relations with Iran and regard for him we have examined carefully what                        steps could be taken against Afshar and his publication but under our system                        of government traditional freedom accorded press under Constitution and                        other relevant laws we have regrettably come to conclusion that there are                        no legal steps that we can take and in our judgment resort to courts against                        this publication would not be productive5 Unless Department believes there is something we can do about Afshar and                        his publication Embassy recommends we be authorized to respond to MFA along foregoing lines It is important                        that we be able to say we are speaking on behalf of high levels within                            USGTelegram 103917 to Tehran May 30 sent the requested authority to                            respond to the

CHARGE WAS SUMMONED TO MFA THIS MORNING MAY 23  BY SECRETARIAT DIRECTOR GENERAL NADIM,  WHO REFERRED TO DISCUSSIONS OUTLINED IN REF A AND B REGARDING NASSER AFSHAR,  AND THEN UNDER INSTRUCTIONS FROM HIM RAISED QUESTION OF APRIL/ MAY 1973  ISSUE OF IRAN FREE PRESS WHICH SHAH HAD JUST SEEN.   NADIM SAID SHAH WAS SHOCKED OVER SCURRILOUS CONTENTS OF THIS ISSUE AND DISTURBED THAT COUNTRY WITH WHICH IRAN HAS SUCH CLOSE RELATIONS COULD PERMIT PUBLICATION OF THIS TYPE OF YELLOW JOURNAL- ISM WHICH FULL OF LIBELOUS,  IRRESPONSIBLE AND INACCURATE STATEMENTS. R\n2.   IN REPLY CHARGE SAID THAT HE FULLY AGREED WITH NADIM S DESCRIPTION OF THIS PUBLICATION WITH ITS DISGRACEFUL CONTENTS,  THAT WE HAVE BEEN EXPLORING WITH WASHINGTON FOR SOMETIME WHETHER ACTION COULD BE TAKEN AGAINST IRAN FREE PRESS,  BUT WITHOUT SUCCESS SO FAR,  AND THAT  CONFIDENTIAL\n3.   COMMENT:   SHELTERED AS HE IS BY LOCAL CONVENTIONS AND PRACTICES FROM ANY CRITICISM,  SHAH HAS ALWAYS BEEN SENSITIVE TO CRITICAL COMMENTS DIRECTED AGAINST HIM OR HIS REGIME.   AS HE GAINS IN STATURE AND SELF- CONFIDENCE HE IS INCREASINGLY SENSITIVE AND FINDS IT MORE AND MORE DIFFICULT TO UNDERSTAND DEMOCRATIC PRACTICES IN COUNTRIES LIKE US AND GERMANY WHICH HE SEES AS OVERLY PERMISSIVE AND WHICH APPEAR TO TOLERATE AND CONDONE ANTI- IRANIAN ACTIVITIES AND PERSONAL ATTACKS ON SHAH.   RELATIONS BE- TWEEN IRAN AND GERMANY IN RECENT YEARS HAVE SEVERAL TIMES BEEN STRAINED BECAUSE OF SUCH DEVELOPMENTS,  BUT DURING SAME PERIOD WE HAVE BEEN SPARED IMPERIAL UNHAPPINESS OVER OCCASIONAL ANTI- IRANIAN DEMONSTRATION IN US OR ACTIVITIES OF PERSONS LIKE NASSER AFSHAR AND HIS IRAN FREE PRESS. AS SUGGESTED IN REF A SHAH HAS APPARENTLY DECIDED NOT TO IGNORE ANY FURTHER ANTI- SHAH ELEMENTS IN US AND,  GIVEN CLOSE RELATIONS BETWEEN TWO COUNTRIES,  HE APPARENTLY HOPES WE CAN DO SOMETHING ABOUT PEOPLE LIKE AFSHAR BEFORE HIS FORTHCOMING VISIT TO US.\n4.   IN THIS CONTEXT REF C IS HELPFUL IN ANSWERING  SPECIFIC QUESTIONS ABOUT AFSHAR BUT WE BELIEVE WE ALSO NEED MORE GENERAL MESSAGE WHICH WILL MASSAGE SHAH S SENSITIVI- TIES AND PUT IRAN FREE PRESS AND AFSHAR IN PROPER PERSPECTIVE.   IN RESPONDING TO MFA QUERIES WE WILL DRAW ON REF C BUT WE WOULD ALSO LIKE TO BE ABLE TO SAY THAT MATTER HAS BEEN CONSIDERED ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS AT HIGH LEVELS OF USG AND THAT USG DEEPLY DEPLORES YELLOW JOURNALISM REPRESENTED BY IRAN FREE PRESS AND TOTALLY DISASSOCIATES ITSELF FROM THIS PUBLICATION.   FURTHER, BECAUSE OF OUR CLOSE RELATIONS WITH IRAN AND REGARD FOR HIM,  WE HAVE EXAMINED CAREFULLY WHAT STEPS COULD BE TAKEN AGAINST AFSHAR AND HIS PUBLICATION BUT UNDER OUR SYSTEM OF GOVERNMENT,  TRADI-  CONFIDENTIAL\n5.   UNLESS DEPARTMENT BELIEVES THERE IS SOMETHING WE CAN DO ABOUT AFSHAR AND HIS PUBLICATION EMBASSY RECOMMENDS WE BE AUTHORIZED TO RESPOND TO MFA ALONG FOREGOING LINES.   IT IS IMPORTANT THAT WE BE ABLE TO SAY WE ARE SPEAKING ON BEHALF OF HIGH LEVELS WITHIN USG. HECK\n",1054434

MFA DIRECTOR GENERAL DARAI CONVOKED DCM MAY 10  FOR DIS- CUSSION OF CASE OF NASSER AFSHAR,  WHO ALSO GOES BY LAST NAME OF GHOTLI IN IRANIAN FILES.   DARAI READ FROM CAREFULLY PREPARED STATEMENT MAKING CLEAR HIGH- LEVEL IRANIAN INTEREST IN THIS MAT- TER.   HE EVENTUALLY CONFIRMED THAT HE WAS ACTING UNDER INSTRUC- TIONS FROM SHAH,  WHO HAD RECENTLY RECEIVED NEW INFORMATION ABOUT AFSHAR WHICH HAD INCENSED HIM AND ON WHICH HE WISHED CLARIFICA- TION FROM USG.\n2.   DARAI STARTED HIS PRESENTATION WITH RECITATION OF AFSHAR S EARLY CAREER IN IRAN DURING AND AFTER WORLD WAR II,  DURING WHICH  CONFIDENTIAL\n3.   DARAI SAID THAT AFSHAR S ACTIVITIES IN US CONTINUED TO COME TO GOI S ATTENTION.   GOI IS AWARE OF HIS PERFORMANCE AS PUBLISHER OF SCURRILOUS SHEET KNOWN AS IRAN FREE PRESS.   IN ADDITION HIS NAME POPS UP OCCASIONALLY AS INFLUENCE PEDLAR, ONE SUCH CASE BEING HIS ATTEMPT OBTAIN $300,000  COMMISSION FOR ALLEGEDLY INFLUENCING GENERAL FOUFANIAN IN FAVOR OF BMY CONTRACT FOR TANK RETROFIT FACTORY IN MIS.   ACCORDING TO DARAI THIS WAS COMPLETE FRAUD AS AFSHAR HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH DECISIONS ON CONTRACT.\n4.   DARAI WENT ON TO SAY THAT USG S APPARENT LACK OF CONCERN AND PERMISSIVENESS ABOUT AFSHAR S CONTINUING SCANDALOOUS ANTI- IRANIAN ACTIVITIES IN US AND HIS ATTEMPTS TO INVOLVE AMER- ICAN BUSINESS FIRMS SUCH AS BMY IN FRAUDULENT ACTIVITIES ARE HARD  FOR IRANIANS TO UNDERSTAND.   HOWEVER,  WHAT REALLY UPSET SHAH WAS DISCOVERY FEW DAYS AGO THAT ON OCTOBER 13, 1970  AFSHAR WAS  ISSUED US PASSPORT.   ALLOWING AFSHAR FREEDOM TO PUBLISH HIS SCANDA- LOUS SHEET AND GRANTING HIM US CITIZENSHIP IS BAD ENOUGH BUT UNDERSTANDABLE UNDER US LAWS.   WHAT HIM DOES NOT UNDERSTAND IS HOW USG CAN ISSUE HIM PASSPORT WITHOUT CHECKING INTO HIS RECORD,  ESPECIALLY WITH GOI,  WHICH WOULD REVEAL THAT HE IS A KNOWN EMBEZZLER ENGAGED IN TREASONABLE AND INSULTING ANTI- IRANIAN ACTIVITIES,  COOPERATING WITH RADICAL ANTI- IRANIAN ELE- MENTS IN US,  GUILTY OF US TAX EVASION IN 1969,  AND SUSPECTED OF\n5.   DCM SAID THAT EMBASSY WAS GENERALLY AWARE OF AFSHAR S ACTIVITIES IN US,  INCLUDING IRAN FREE PRESS,  AND AGREED THAT AFSHAR S PERFORMANCE WAS SCANDALOUS AND HIS EFFORTS TO MOUNT ANTI- IRANIAN CAMPAIGN IN US EXTREMELY UNFORTUNATE.   IN FACT IN LAST TWO YEARS EMBASSY HAD SEVERAL TIMES RAISED WITH DEPART- MENT QUESTION WHETHER IRAN FREE PRESS COULD BE CLOSED DOWN. MATTER HAD BEEN CAREFULLY STUDIED BUT LAWYERS HAD CONCLUDED THAT UNDER US LAWS THERE WAS REGRETTABLY NO BASIS FOR SUCH ACTION.

Soviets would like to see dtente3 On April 18 I discussed matter informally with Turkish Ambassador who                        verified that Iraq apparently serious about dtente and said Turkey had                        already taken some steps to bring parties together It seems likely                        therefore that Turks helped set up Geneva meeting Ambassador Cuhruk                        thought process would be difficult and time consuming but worth Turkeys                        best efforts He said Iraqis did not want Soviets to act as                        intermediary4 It is generally agreed that major issue to be resolved is Shatt alArab                        and Irans unilateral abrogation of 1937 treaty Baath regime cannot accept                        abrogation as fait accompli because it would mean surrendering Iraqi                        territory that had been obtained by Nuri Said Turkish Ambassador suspects                        Iraq would be willing to agree to new treaty that recognized de facto                        situation but only if Iran first declared its willingness to rescind                        unilateral abrogation and negotiate new treaty With regard to Kurdish                        problem which is probably principal reason for Iraqs desire for dtente                        Turkish Ambassadors feeling is that it better left aside for time being                        since it is most long standing and intractable bilateral issue Continuing                        propaganda and subversion by both sides is other main issue Moratorium on                        such activity would be good way for each side to demonstrate its                        seriousness Finally there is general skepticism here that Shah seriously                        interested in dtente with Iraq Having such a nasty Sovietoriented                        neighbor not only makes him look good but helps justify his large military                        expenditures5 Comment: I believe dtente would be in US                        interest Iraq is increasingly anxious to get on with economic development                        and dtente would encourage this trend This is not to say Baath regime                        would not continue to be antiAmerican radically Arab nationalistic and                        ambitious to spread Baath doctrine throughout Persian Gulf It could mean                        however a loosening of ties particularly military ties with USSR and further enhancement of Iraqs                        independence While any US role in encouraging dtente is out of question                        in Iraq it may be that at appropriate moment US could influence Shah to                        meet Iraqs legitimate demands For example on question of new Shatt                        alArab treaty perhaps Shah could be persuaded to negotiate new treaty in                        secret and if suitable outcome obtained make announcement on withdrawal of                        unilateral abrogation concurrently with public signing of new treaty Shah                        would get what he wants and Iraq would save face Any USG interest in this subject is highly                        sensitive as far as Iraq concerned Although Abdul Baqis meeting with                        Iranian ForMin is already known to some                            diplomats here I intend to                        discuss this subject only with Turkish Ambassador unless instructed                        otherwiseLowrie,frus1969-76v27d215,"1.   SUMMARY:  IRAQI INTEREST IN DETENTE WITH IRAN HAS BEEN SUBJECT OF DISCREET SOUNDINGS AMONG SELECT EMBASSIES FOR PAST TWO MONTHS.  IRAQ WISHES TURKEY TO BE INTERMEDIARY AND TURKEY APPARENTLY WILLING TO OBLIGE DESPITE OBVIOUS DIFFICULTIES.  IF WAY COULD BE FOUND TO BRING ABOUT DETENTE,  IT COULD ENHANCE IRAQI POLITICAL INDEPENDENCE,  IN SAME WAY IPC SETTLEMENT ENHANCED ECONOMIC INDEPENDENCE.  THERE IS REAL DOUBT HERE,  HOWEVER,  WHETHER IRAN IS SERIOUSLY INTERESTED IN DETENTE.  END SUMMARY. \n2.   DURING PAST TWO MONTHS I LEARNED FROM BOTH FRENCH AND ALGERIAN AMBASSADORS THAT HIGH IRAQI OFFICIALS HAD HINTED TO NEW TURKISH AMBASSADOR NAZIF CUHRUK THAT IRAQ WOULD LIKE TURKEY TO BE INTERMEDIARY IN EXPLORING POSSIBILITY OF DETENTE WITH IRAN.  ALGERIAN AMBASSADOR,  WHO WELL CONNECTED WITH REGIME,  STRESSED THAT TIME WAS RIPE FOR DETENTE AND THAT TURKEY IDEAL COUNTRY TO ACT AS INTERMEDIARY.  HE ALSO THOUGHT SOVIETS WOULD LIKE TO SEE DETENTE. \n3.   ON APRIL 18  I DISCUSSED MATTER INFORMALLY WITH TURKISH     SECRET      AMBASSADOR WHO VERIFIED THAT IRAQ APPARENTLY SERIOUS ABOUT DETENTE AND SAID TURKEY HAD ALREADY TAKEN SOME STEPS TO BRING PARTIES TOGETHER.  IT SEEMS LIKELY,  THEREFORE,  THAT TURKS HELPED SET UP GENEVA MEETING.  AMBASSADOR CUHRUK THOUGHT PROCESS WOULD BE DIFFICULT AND TIME CONSUMING BUT WORTH TURKEY S BEST EFFORTS.  HE SAID IRAQIS DID NOT WANT SOVIETS TO ACT AS INTERMEDIARY. \n4.   IT IS GENERALLY AGREED THAT MAJOR ISSUE TO BE RESOLVED IS SHATT AL- ARAB AND IRAN S UNILATERAL ABROGATION OF 1937  TREATY.  BAATH REGIME CANNOT ACCEPT ABROGATION AS FAIT ACCOMPLI BECAUSE IT WOULD MEAN SURRENDERING IRAQI TERRITORY THAT HAD BEEN OBTAINED BY NURI SAID.  TURKISH AMBASSADOR SUSPECTS IRAQ WOULD BE WILLING TO AGREE TO NEW TREATY THAT RECOGNIZED DE FACTO SITUATION,  BUT ONLY IF IRAN FIRST DECLARED ITS WILLINGNESS TO RESCIND UNILATERAL ABROGATION AND NEGOTIATE NEW TREATY.  WITH REGARD TO KURDISH PROBLEM,  WHICH IS PROBABLY PRINCIPAL REASON FOR IRAQ S DESIRE FOR DETENTE,  TURKISH AMBASSADOR S FEELING IS THAT IT BETTER LEFT ASIDE FOR TIME BEING SINCE IT IS MOST LONG STANDING AND INTRACTABLE BILATERAL ISSUE.  CONTINUING PROPAGANDA AND SUBVERSION BY BOTH SIDES IS OTHER MAIN ISSUE.  MORATORIUM ON SUCH ACTIVITY WOULD BE GOOD WAY FOR EACH SIDE TO DEMONSTRATE ITS SERIOUSNESS.  FINALLY,  THERE IS GENERAL SKEPTICISM HERE THAT SHAH SERIOUSLY INTERESTED IN DETENTE WITH IRAQ.  HAVING SUCH A NASTY,  SOVIET- ORIENTED NEIGHBOR NOT ONLY MAKES HIM LOOK GOOD,  BUT HELPS JUSTIFY HIS LARGE MILITARY EXPENDITURES. \n5.   COMMENT:  I BELIEVE DETENTE WOULD BE IN U. S.  INTEREST.  IRAQ IS INCREASINGLY ANXIOUS TO GET ON WITH ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND DETENTE WOULD ENCOURAGE THIS TREND.  THIS IS NOT TO SAY BAATH REGIME WOULD NOT CONTINUE TO BE ANTI-  AMERICAN,  RADICALLY ARAB NATIONALISTIC,  AND AMBITIOUS TO SPREAD BAATH DOCTRINE THROUGHOUT PERSIAN GULF.  IT COULD MEAN,  HOWEVER,  A LOOSENING OF TIES,  PARTICULARLY MILITARY TIES,  WITH USSR AND FURTHER ENHANCEMENT OF IRAQ S INDEPENDENCE.  WHILE ANY U. S.  ROLE IN ENCOURAGING DETENTE IS OUT OF QUESTION IN IRAQ,  IT MAY BE THAT AT APPROPRIATE MOMENT U. S.  COULD INFLUENCE SHAH TO MEET IRAQ S LEGITIMATE DEMANDS.  FOR EXAMPLE,   ON QUESTION OF NEW SHATT AL- ARAB TREATY,  PERHAPS     SECRET      SHAH COULD BE PERSUADED TO NEGOTIATE NEW TREATY IN SECRET AND IF SUITABLE OUTCOME OBTAINED,  MAKE ANNOUNCEMENT ON WITHDRAWAL OF UNILATERAL ABROGATION CONCURRENTLY WITH PUBLIC SIGNING OF NEW TREATY.  SHAH WOULD GET WHAT HE WANTS AND IRAQ WOULD SAVE FACE.  ANY USG INTEREST IN THIS SUBJECT IS HIGHLY SENSITIVE AS FAR AS IRAQ CONCERNED.  ALTHOUGH ABDUL BAQI S MEETING WITH IRANIAN FORMIN IS ALREADY KNOWN TO SOME DIPLOMATS HERE,  I INTEND TO DISCUSS THIS SUBJECT ONLY WITH TURKISH AMBASSADOR UNLESS INSTRUCTED OTHERWISE.

Ambassador who well connected with regime stressed that time was ripe for                        dtente and that Turkey ideal country to act as intermediary He also                        thought Soviets would like to see dtente3 On April 18 I discussed matter informally with Turkish Ambassador who                        verified that Iraq apparently serious about dtente and said Turkey had                        already taken some steps to bring parties together It seems likely                        therefore that Turks helped set up Geneva meeting Ambassador Cuhruk                        thought process would be difficult and time consuming but worth Turkeys                        best efforts He said Iraqis did not want Soviets to act as                        intermediary4 It is generally agreed that major issue to be resolved is Shatt alArab                        and Irans unilateral abrogation of 1937 treaty Baath regime cannot accept                        abrogation as fait accompli because it would mean surrendering Iraqi                        territory that had been obtained by Nuri Said Turkish Ambassador suspects                        Iraq would be willing to agree to new treaty that recognized de facto                        situation but only if Iran first declared its willingness to rescind                        unilateral abrogation and negotiate new treaty With regard to Kurdish                        problem which is probably principal reason for Iraqs desire for dtente                        Turkish Ambassadors feeling is that it better left aside for time being                        since it is most long standing and intractable bilateral issue Continuing                        propaganda and subversion by both sides is other main issue Moratorium on                        such activity would be good way for each side to demonstrate its                        seriousness Finally there is general skepticism here that Shah seriously                        interested in dtente with Iraq Having such a nasty Sovietoriented                        neighbor not only makes him look good but helps justify his large military

doctrine throughout Persian Gulf It could mean                        however a loosening of ties particularly military ties with USSR and further enhancement of Iraqs                        independence While any US role in encouraging dtente is out of question                        in Iraq it may be that at appropriate moment US could influence Shah to                        meet Iraqs legitimate demands For example on question of new Shatt                        alArab treaty perhaps Shah could be persuaded to negotiate new treaty in                        secret and if suitable outcome obtained make announcement on withdrawal of                        unilateral abrogation concurrently with public signing of new treaty Shah                        would get what he wants and Iraq would save face Any USG interest in this subject is highly                        sensitive as far as Iraq concerned Although Abdul Baqis meeting with                        Iranian ForMin is

GOI ESTIMATES THAT OIL REVENUES WILL REACH TWO BILLION DOLLARS IN 1975  AND TO BEST OF MY KNOWLEDGE IRAW HAS REGULARLY MET ITS PAYMENTS ON LOANS FROM EXIMBANK IBRD,  AND PRIVATE US BANKS.\n3.   BANKING SECTOR REMAINS RELATIVELY UNPOLITICIZED AND ENJOYS GOOD PROFESSIONAL REPUTATION.   THIS AUGURS WELL FOR IRAQ S CAPABILITY TO MEET EXIMBANKS FINANCIAL AND LEGAL REQUIREMENTS, AT LEAST ON TECHNICAL LEVEL.\n4.   WHILE THERE IS RISK IN GETTING INVOLVED IN A MAJOR PROJECT AS FIRST STEP,  DEALING WITH EXIMBANK WOULD BE IMPORTANT POLITICAL STEP WHICH BAATH REGIME WOULD PROBABLY NOT BE WILLING TO TAKE  CONFIDENTIAL\n5.   I AM UNABLE TO PROVIDE ANY DETAILS ON BROWN AND ROOT PROJECT BEYOND FACT THAT INOC ANXIOUS TO PROCEED WITH CONSTRUCTION OF ITS OWN DEEP SEA TERMINAL FOR EXPANSION OF NORTH RUMAILA PRODUCTION. IT IS BELIEVED THAT TERMINAL WOULD BE LOCATED IN WHAT ARE NOW KUWAITI TERRITORIAL WATERS AND THIS COULD BE SERIOUS COMPLICATING FACTOR.\n6.   ASSUME THAT WHEN AND IF A PRELIMINARY COMMITMENT APPROVED FOR PROJECT IN IRAQ,  EXIMBANK WOULD HAVE TO DEAL DIRECTLY WITH INOC OR OTHER IRAQI ENTITY.   AT THIS POINT,  MANY DISPUTES COULD DEVELOP OVER SUPPLYING OF FINANCIAL DATA,  GUARANTEE OF IRAQI GOVERNMENT,  AND OTHER REQUIREMENTS THAT GOI LIKELY TO VIEW AS INFRINGEMENTS ON ITS SOVEREIGNTY. THESE PROBLEMS SHOULD NOT PROVE INSURMOUNTABLE IF GOI SERIOUS ABOUT WANTING US SUPPLIERS AND FINANCING.\n7.   LARGE POTENTIAL MARKET IN IRAQ AND KEEN INTEREST OF NUMEROUS US FIRMS TO ENTER THIS MARKET,  PARTICULARLY PETROLEUM SECTOR,  SHOULD ENCOURAGE EXIMBANK TO ADOPT HIGHLY FLEXIBLE POLICY UNTIL SERIOUSNESS OF GOI INTEREST IN USG FINANCING HAS BEEN TESTED.\n8.

NATIONAL CONVENTION ( NC),  LOOSE CONFEDERATION OF ANTI- SAG BLACK POLITICAL GROUPS IN NAMIBIA,  STILL HAS MADE NO STATEMENT ON UN SYG WALDHEIM S REPORT TO SC AND ON SAG POSITION CONTAINED IN THAT REPORT.  NC LEADERS SAY THEY DO NOT HAVE FULL TEXT OF WALDHEIM REPORT AND CANNOT MAKE JUDGMENT UNTIL THEY RECEIVE AND STUDY IT.  WHILE THERE MAY BE SOME TRUTH IN THIS ASSERTION, ON MAY 15  NC DEPUTY CHAIRMAN CHIEF CLEMENS KAPUUO ADMITTED TO POL COUNSELOR PETTERSON IN KATATURA,  WINDHOEK S BLACK TOWNSHIP, THAT THERE DISAGREEMENT AMONG NC MEMBERS AS TO WHAT THEIR STATEMENT SHOULD SAY.  KAPUUO SAID MINORITY WANTED TO ISSUE FLAT REJECTION OF SAG POSITION AND OF CONTINUATION OF SYG S  CONFIDENTIAL     MANDATE.  MAJORITY ,  HOWEVER,  DECIDED WAIT TO SEE WHAT DEVELOPS IN OAU,  AND POSSIBLY SC AS WELL,  BEFORE COMMITTING NC.\n2.  NC,  IT SHOULD BE REMEMBERED,  IS NOT A WELL- STRUCTURED, EFFECTIVELY OPERATING POLITICAL BODY.  ITS ORGANIZATION IS RUDIMENTARY AND IT SORELY LACKS ADEQUATE FINANCIAL RESOURCES. ALTHOUGH KAPUUO HAS BECOME WELL KNOWN,  HE IS NOT STRONG LEADER AROUND WHO DISPARATE ETHNIC AND POLITICAL ELEMENTS REPRESENTED IN NC COULD COALESCE.  NC LACKS COHERENT PLAN OF ACTION BEYOND NEGATIVE APPROACH TO SA CONTROL OF SWA.  NEVERTHELESS,  ANTIPATHY TOWARD SAG HAS GIVEN NC SUFFICIENT UNITY FOR IT TO FORM AND TO SURVIVE,  THEREBY PROVIDING ANTI- SAG BLACKS WITH PLATFORM FROM WHICH THEY CAN EXPRESS THEIR COMMON VIEWPOINTS.  MOREOVER, ALTHOUGH ESTIMATES DIFFER AS TO AMOUNT OF SUPPORT IT HAS AMONG BLACK PEOPLES OF SWA,  OBSERVERS IN THE TERRITORY GENERALLY AGREE THAT NC REPRESENTS POLITICAL OPINIONS OF MOST POLITICALLY CONSCIOUS BLACK NAMIBIANS.\n3.  DESPITE FACT THAT OFFICIAL NC POLICY IS TO DEFER COMMENTING ON WALDHEIM REPORT,  IN SEPARATE CONVERSATIONS WITH PETTERSON VARIOUS LEADING FIGURES OF NC MADE IT CLEAR THEY HARBOUR DEEP AND ABIDING MISTRUST OF SAG AND DO NOT BELIEVE SOUTH AFRICANS HAVE MADE ANY CONCESSIONS ON SWA.  KAPUUO,  GERSON VEII ( SWANU, FOREIGN AFFAIRS SECRETARY FOR NC),  DAVID MERORO ( SWAPO)  AND THREE LESSER LIGHTS OF NC ALL SAID THAT IF SAG MEANT WHAT IT SAID TO WALDHEIM,  WHY DID IT CONTINUE IMPLEMENT BANTUSTAN POLICY BY GRANTING SELF- GOVERNMENT TO OWAMBO AND KAVANGO RIGHT AFTER WALDHEIM MADE HIS REPORT? ( CAPE TOWN 353).  AND WHY HAS SAG PARTICIPATED IN ARREST OF NC MEMBERS JOHANNES NANGUTUUALA, JOHNNY OTTO AND SEVERAL OTHERS IN OWAMBO?  ( CAPE TOWN 352).\n4.  WHILE CONCEDING THAT SAG ACTIONS IN THESE MATTERS INEPT AT BEST,  PETTERSON,  DRAWING ON SUBSTANCE OF USUN 1669  AND CAPE TOWN\n5.  NONE OF NC LEADERS SEEMED TO HAVE GIVEN SERIOUS CONSIDERATION TO ALTERNATIVES TO CONTINUATION OF SYG S INITIATIVE.  HOWEVER, EACH WAS NON- COMMITTAL AND LEFT IMPRESSION NC WOULD OPT IN FAVOR OF REJECTING SAG PROPOSALS.  THIS DESPITE FACT THAT KAPUUO S LONG- HELD FAITH THAT UN WILL TAKE CONTROL OF SWA SEEMS TO BE WAVERING AND THAT VEII SAYS HE FULLY AWARE UN WILL NOT COME TO RESCUE OF BLACKS IN SWA.\n6.  COMMENT:  NATIONAL CONVENTION S INTRANSIGENCE AND LACK OF FAITH IN SAG INTENTIONS ARE UNDERSTANDABLE,  GIVEN PAST HISTORY OF WHITES  DUPLICITY AND REPRESSION OF BLACKS IN SWA.  IT POSSIBLE,  ACCORDING SOME SOURCES,  THAT SOME NC MEMBERS ( E. G. , REHOBOTH BASTERS)  MAY IN TIME CHOOSE TO SIT ON MULTI- RACIAL ADVISORY COUNCIL.  BUT ON CRUCIAL IMMEDIATE ISSUE OF WHETHER TO SUPPORT PROPOSALS IN WALDHEIM REPORT,  IT APPEARS NC WILL, RATHER THAN REVEAL DISAGREEMENT WITHIN ITS RANKS,  CHOOSE TO REMAIN SILENT AT LEAST UNTIL AFTER OAU MEETING.  HOWEVER, FORTHCOMING TRIAL OF OVAMBOS AND ANY OTHER UNFAVORABLE EVENTS IN OWAMBO OR ELSEWHERE IN TERRITORY COULD IMPEL THEM TO DECLARE AGAINST CONTINUATION OF UN- SAG DIALOGUE. HURD\n",1048524

WHAT LITTLE PRESS REACTION THERE HAS BEEN TO SYG WALDHEIM S REPORT ON NAMIBIA HAS BEEN MIXED.  MORE COMMENT LIKELY AFTER SUBJECT IS DISCUSSED IN PARLIAMENT,  WHEN FONMIN MULLER S HEALTH PERMITS HIM TO RESUME DEBATE.  ARGUS,  A CAPE TOWN ENGLISH- LANGUAGE PAPER,  HAS SAID SOUTH AFRICA S "" LATEST OUTLINE OF HER POSITION ON THE TERRITORY WILL BE SEEN IN THIS COUNTRY AND CERTAINLY AMONG MOST WHITES IN THE TERRITORY ITSELF AS HAVING MADE SUBSTANTIAL CONCESSIONS TO WORLD OPINION SINCE DECEMBER."" ARGUS ADDED THAT SOUTH AFRICA S UNDERTAKING "" FULLY TO RESPECT THE WISHES OF THE WHOLE POPULATION OF THE TERRITORY WITH REGARD TO THE FUTURE CONSTITUTIONAL ORGANIZATION OF THE TERRITORY,"" AND SAG S REFERENCES TO "" POPULATION""  OF SWA RATHER THAN "" PEOPLES""  OF TERRITORY "" SHOULD BE ENCOURAGING,  TO SAY THE LEAST, TO MEMBERS OF THE UN SINCERE IN THEIR WISH FOR A PEACEFUL  LIMITED OFFICIAL USE\n2.  PRETORIA S AFRIKAANS NEWSPAPER,  OGGENDBLAD,  SOUNDED CAUTIONARY NOTE IN AN EDITORIAL WHICH EMPHASIZED THE TWO DIFFERENT APPROACHES TO SELF- DETERMINATION.  SOUTH AFRICA WISHED TO RECOGNIZE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN PEOPLES WHILE UN PUSHING TO OVERRIDE THESE DIFFERENCES.  THIS WAS BASIS OF INAB LITY OF UN AND SAG TO SEE EYE- TO- EYE ON MEANING OF SELF- DETERMINATION.  MAY 2  EDITION OF ENGLISH- LANGUAGE PRETORIA NEWS HAD BANNER HEADLINE, "" INDEPENDENCE FOR SOUTH WEST AFRICA IN 10  YEARS.""\n3.  MOST SIGNIFICANT PRESS COMMENT WAS CONTAINED IN ARTICLE IN MAY 3  DIE BURGER,  VOICE OF CAPE NATIONAL PARTY.  UNNAMED POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT QUOTED "" AUTHORITATIVE SOURCES""  AS SAYING SAG HAD MADE "" NO CONCESSIONS""  ON SWA.  ANY INTERPRETATION THAT IT HAD WOULD BE "" TOTALLY WRONG.""  ACCORDING TO WRITER,  WALDHEIM REPORT DEALT ONLY WITH CLARIFICATIONS OF POINTS PREVIOUSLY UNDER DISCUSSION.  THESE CLARIFICATIONS WERE MERELY  "" ACCESSORIES TO PREVIOUS DISCUSSION AND WOULD NOT IN ANY WAY BREAK NEW GROUND."" SAG POSITION BASED ON ARTICLE 1 (2)  OF UN CHARTER WHICH CALLS FOR "" EQUAL RIGHTS AND SELF- DETERMINATION OF PEOPLES.""  SOUTH AFRICA THEREFORE IN COMPLIANCE WITH ITS OBLIGATION UNDER CHARTER. KEY WORD AS FAR AS SAG WAS CONCERNED WAS "" WOEKJDS"".  IN SAG S VIEW,  ARTICLE CONTINUED,  EACH OF THE PEOPLES OF SWA SHOULD HAVE RIGHT TO SELF- DETERMINATION.  ACCORDING TO WRITER,  THIS POINT OUGHT TO BE VERY CLEAR AND NO ONE SHOULD SAY THAT SAG HAD ATTEMPTED TO GIVE A "" DOUBLE MEANING""  TO THE WORD SELF- DETERMINATION.  HE CONCLUDED BY REITERATING THAT NO CONCESSIONS WERE MADE BY SAG TO UN VIEWPOINT.\n4.  COMMENT:  DIE BURGER ARTICLE AND COMMENT BY PRIME MINISTER VORSTER ARE CLEAR EVIDENCE SAG COVERING ITS FLANKS FROM CRITICISM FROM THE RIGHT IN SA AND NAMIBIA.

FOREIGN MINISTER DR.  HILGARD MULLER RETURNED TO HOUSE OF ASSEMBLY MAY 8  AFTER HIS BOUT WITH KIDNEY STONE,  ALLOWING FOREIGN POLICY DEBATE TO RESUME. ENSUING TWO- DAY EXCHANGE HELD LITTLE INTEREST EXCEPT FOR COMMENTS ON UN SECRETARY GENERAL WALDHEIM S REPORT TO SECURITY COUNCIL ON NAMIBIA.   EVEN THERE, TACIT AGREEMENT BETWEEN GOVERNMENT AND OPPOSITION PARTIES  LIMITED OFFICIAL USE\n2.   COMMENTING ON WALDHEIM REPORT,  OPPOSITION UNITED PARTY S ( UP)  CHIEF SPOKESMAN ON FOREIGN AFFAIRS,  JAPIE BASSON,  SAID SAG HAD APPARENTLY AGREED TO PRINCIPLES CONCERNING FUTURE OF TERRITORY WHICH FUNDAMENTALLY AFFECTED INTERESTS OF ITS INHABITANTS,  AS WELL AS INTERESTS OF SOUTH AFRICA ITSELF.   THEREFORE,  IT WAS INCUMBENT ON SAG TO RESIST TEMPTATION TO PLAY POLITICS WITH NAMIBIAN QUESTION AND TO SPELL OUT IN CLEAR TERMS IN WHICH DIRECTION IT WAS MOVING WITH RESPECT TO TERRITORY.   HE SAID HE COULD APPRECIATE NEED FOR DIS- CRETION WHERE ACTIVE NEGOTIATIONS WERE UNDERWAY,  BUT THE WALDHEIM REPORT WAS NOW IN PUBLIC DOMAIN AND GOVERNMENT OWED FULL EXPLANATION TO PEOPLE.   BASSON SAID THERE MUCH CONFUSION AND CONCERN AMONG PEOPLES OF NAMIBIA, INCLUDING WHITES AND COLOREDS WHO SEEMED TO BE ONLY PEOPLES WITHOUT SPECIFIC "" HOMELANDS"".   IT WOULD BE HELP- FUL TO ALL PARTIES CONCERNED IF SAG STOPPED TALKING IN "" ABSTRACT TERMS""  ABOUT FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS AND BEGAN TO CREATE "" VISIBLE""  OPPORTUNITIES FOR SELF- DEVELOPMENT. HE ADDED THAT THE VARIOUS POPULATION GROUPS OF NAMIBIA SEEMED TO BE THINKING MORE AND MORE ALONG LINES OF A FEDERATION,  SUCH AS HAD BEEN SUGGESTED BY UP.\n3.   PROGRESSIVE PARTY MP MRS.  HELEN SUZMAN COMPLIMENTED SAG ON "" PROGRESS""  MADE SO FAR IN THE SYG- SAG DIALOGUE. SHE SAID SAG HAD GONE "" FURTHER THAN IT HAD EVER DONE BEFORE""  WITH RESPECT TO NAMIBIA.   MULTI- RACIAL ADVISORY COUNCIL WAS A "" SIGN OF PROGRESS"",  ALTHOUGH MRS.  SUZMAN BELIEVED THAT IT HAD NOT GOTTEN OFF TO A VERY AUSPICIOUS START.   GOVERNMENT HAD ALSO COME LONG WAY STATING IT WOULD TAKE NO FURTHER STEPS CONCERNING NAMIBIA WITHOUT FIRST CONSULTING PEOPLE OF THE TERRITORY AND BY SAYING THAT FUTURE OF NAMIBIA WOULD BE DTERMINED BY INHABI- TANTS.   HOWEVER,  SHE THOUGHT SOUTH AFRICA S ARGUMENT OVER THE TERRITORY WOULD BE GREATLY STRENGTHENED IF SAG LIFTED EMERGENCY REGULATIONS WHICH PERMITTED DETENTION WITHOUT TRIAL.\n4.   FOREIGN MINISTERMULLER REPLIED TO OPPOSITION SPEAKERS ON MAY 9.   HE SAID GOVERNMENT HAD GONE OUT OF ITS WAY TO MAINTAIN CONTACT WITH WALDHEIM AND TO FIND A "" SATIS- FACTORY AND PEACEFUL SOLUTION""  TO NAMIBIA DEADLOCK. SINCE DECISION ON WHETHER OR NOT TO CONTINUE SYG- SAG DIALOGUE WAS IN THE BALANCE AT THIS TIME,  MULLER SAID IT WOULD BE "" UNWISE""  FOR HIM TO DISCUSS WALDHEIM REPORT IN ANY DETAIL.   HOWEVER ,  HE FELT FREE TO REPEAT PRINCIPLES GOVERNING SAG S ACTIONS IN NAMIBIA.   HE SAID GOVERNMENT S POLICY REMAINED THAT NAMIBIA SHOULD DECIDE ITS OWN FUTURE IN ACCORDANCE WITH ARTICLE 1 (2)  OF UN CHARTER. TO ACCOMPLISH THIS,  SAG WAS TRYING TO PROVIDE PEOPLES OF NAMIBIA WITH EXPERIENCE OF SELF- GOVERNMENT.   WITH- OUT SUCH EXPERIENCE,  HE ASKED,  WHAT PEOPLE WOULD BE IN POSITION TO MAKE A MEANINGFUL CHOICE?  GRANT OF SELF- GOVERNMING STATUS TO OWAMBO AND KAVANGO WAS SAG S WAY OF PROVIDING SUCH EXPERIENCE.   MULLER ALSO SAID THAT SAG INTENDED MAKE ADVISORY COUNCIL FOR SWA A "" MEANING- FUL CONSULTATIVE INSTRUMENT"".   SAG "" HOPED""  ITS MEMBERS WOULD BE TRULY REPRESENTATIVE OF ALL THE DIFFERENT POPU- LATION GROUPS AND THAT AS COUNCIL BECAME MORE EXPERIENCED AND EFFECTIVE "" IT SHOULD PROGRESSIVELY BECOME AN INSTRUMENT FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF COOPERATION AMONG INHABITANTS OF THE TERRITORY AS A WHOLE.""\n5.   COMMENT:  WHILE THEY MAY HAVE SOMEWHAT DIFFERENT APPROACHES TO NAMIBIAN PROBLEM,  GOVERNMENT AND OPPOSITION PARTIES ALL STRONGLY DESIRE CONTINUATION OF SYG- SAG DIALOGUE AND HAVE TACITLY AGREED TO AVOID CONTENTIOUS DEBATE ON SUBJECT FOR TIME BEINGM  ONLY FACTOR WHICH COULD CAUSE AGREEMENT TO BREAK DOWN WOULD BE FURTHER REVELATIONS OF ARRESTS AND OTHER REPRESSIVE POLITICAL ACTIONS BY LOCAL AUTHORITIES IN NAMIBIA ( CAPE TOWN 361).

VON HIRSCHBERG CALLED ON SCALI MAY 17  AT HIS REQUEST TO DISCUSS SYG S REPORT ON NAMIBIA.  BEFORE GETTING INTO FULL DISCUSSION OF REPORT,  HE ASKED SCALI WHAT US THOUGHT OF IT AND SAG S POSITION.  SCALI MADE POINTS ALONG LINES REFTELS A AND C AND STATED THAT HIS MAIN CONCERN WAS TO SEE THAT THE SYG- SAG TALKS BE CONTINUED. \n2.  IN RESPONSE TO EXPRESSION OF CONCERN OVER IMPLEMENTATION OF HOMELANDS BILL IN NAMIBIA.  VON HIRSCHBERG SAID THAT  CONFIDENTIAL      SAG HAD NEVER USED WORD "" HOMELANDS""  IN NAMIBIA CONTEXT.  HE SAID DIFFERENT REGIONS IN NAMIBIA WERE CALLED NATIVE NATIONS AND THAT BILL WHICH NOW BEING IMPLEMENTED IN OVAMBOLAND WAS NOT DESIGNED TO PREPARE THE WAY FOR SEPARATE DEVELOPMENT BUT MORE TO GIVE PEOPLE IN DIFFERENT REGIONS OF NAMIBIA EXPERIENCE IN SELF GOVERNMENT.  HE SAID EXPERIENCE IN SELF GOVERNMENT COULD NOT BE  GIVEN ON CENTRAL BASIS BUT HAD TO BE DONE ON A REGIONAL BASIS.  HE NOTED THAT CURRENT LEGISLATION PREDETERMINED NOTHING WITH RESPECT TO FUTURE OF TERRITORY AND REFERRED SAG STATEMENT IN SYG S REPORT TO THAT EFFECT ( I. E.,  PARA 1  OF SAG STATEMENT). \n3.  WITH RESPECT TO POSSIBILITY OF NAMIBIA BECOMING INDEPENDENT AS A UNITARY STATE WITH ITS TERRITORIAL INTEGRITY PRESERVED HE ALLOWED THAT THIS WAS POSSIBLE AND DREW ATTENTION AGAIN TO FACT THAT THERE WAS NOTHING IN SAG STATEMENT WHICH WOULD COMPROMISE FULL ACT OF SELF- DETERMINATION IN TERRITORY.  HE SAID HE REALIZED THAT THERE WAS SOME SUSPICION ON THIS MATTER BUT POINTED OUT THAT SAG WOULD TAKE INTO ACCOUNT WISHES OF PEOPLE WITH RESPECT TO FINAL ACT OF SELF- DETERMINATION. \n4.  TURNING TO DETENTION OF CERTAIN PERSONS IN OVAMBOLAND,  VON HIRSCHBERG ACKNOWLEDGED THAT THIS WAS AN UNFORTUNATE EXPERIENCE AND HE RECALLED THAT SAG HAD ACCEPTED PRINCIPLE OF POLITICAL FREEDOM IN TERRITORY DURING ITS DISCUSSIONS WITH SYG.  DETENTIONS WHICH TOOK PLACE IN OVAMBOLAND,  HOWEVER,  WERE DONE PRINCIPALLY AT REQUEST OF CHIEF COUNCILLOR.  ARRESTS HAD BEEN MADE AS RESULT OF FACT THAT POLITICAL PARTY INVOLVED UNWILLING TO GIVE  HIM TIME TO ALLOW OVAMBOLAND LEGISLATIVE COUNCIL TO COMPLETE ITS STUDY OF POLITICAL ACTIVITY IN AREA WITH VIEW ESTABLISHING SPECIFIC GUIDELINES.  ACCORDING TO VON HIRSCHBERG,  CHIEF COUNCILLOR HAD ASKED THAT ARRESTS BE MADE BECAUSE HE FELT THAT DEMONSTRATIONS THAT HAD BEEN ORGANIZED WERE DELIBERATE ATTEMPT TO EMBARRASS SAG AT TIME WHEN SYG WOULD BE SUBMITTING HIS REPORT.  ARRESTS THEREFORE WERE DECISION TAKEN BY LOCAL AUTHORITIES IN OVAMBOLAND AND NOT BY SAG.  SCALI SAID THAT INCIDENTS LIKE THIS COULD ONLY AROUSE SUSPICION AND CREATE GREATER DIFFICULTIES IN UN.  HE SAID THAT FOR SAKE OF LONG- TERM OBJECTIVES HE PERSONALLY WOULD HAVE FELT IT BETTER TO LEAN OVER BACKWARDS IN OPPOSITE DIRECTION RATHER THAN TAKE ACTION LEADING TO DETENTIONS.  VON HIRSCHBERG REPLIED THAT THIS QUESTION OF WEIGHING PRIORITIES AND THAT SAG REALIZED IT SHOULD NOT TAKE ANY ACTION WHICH MIGHT  CONFIDENTIAL      ULTIMATELY "" UPSET THE APPLE CART."" \n5.  TURNING AGAIN TO REPORT,  VON HIRSCHBERG SAID THAT THERE HAS BEEN IN FACT SOME PROGRESS IF ALL THREE REPORTS OF SYG WERE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT.  AS RESULT OF THESE REPORTS AND SYG- SAG CONTACTS,  UN HAD DIRECT INVOLVEMENT IN FUTURE STATUS OF TERRITORY.  HE SAID THAT,  IF TALKS WERE TERMINATED,  THERE WOULD BE NO SYG INVOLVEMENT.   IT WAS IN INTEREST OF UN TO KEEP TALKS GOING. ( AFTER MEETING HE NOTED WRYLY TO MISOFF THAT WITHOUT UN INVOLVEMENT SAG WOULD BE LEFT TO ITS OWN DEVICES.)  HE NOTED THAT SAG HAD DONE NOTHING SO FAR THAT WOULD PRECLUDE UN OBJECTIVES IN NAMIBIA AND FOR THIS REASON TALKS SHOULD BE CONTINUED.  HE REALIZED THAT REASON FOR SYG S COOLNESS TENDED TO BE DUE TO FACT THAT SYG HAD LEARNED HIS LESSON FROM ESCHER REPORT.  SYG THEREFORE UNWILLING TO GO TOO FAR OUT ON LIMB AT THIS JUNCTURE.  HE PRESUMED THAT SYG WOULD EXPRESS HIMSELF MORE CLEARLY IN SC AFTER HAVING ASSESSED RESULTS OF HIS DISCUSSIONS IN OAU AND DECISION OF OAU ON MANDATE. \n6.  TURNING AGAIN TO QUESTION OF SELF- DETERMINATION,  VON HIRSCHBERG NOTED THAT REFERENCE TO TEN YEARS AT LENGTH OF TIME NEEDED FOR PEOPLE OF NAMIBIA TO EXERCISE SELF- DETERMINATION WAS REQUIRED BECAUSE SAG HAD TO PUT FINISHING TOUCHES ON CERTAIN TECHNICAL AND AGRICULTURAL TRAINING PROJECTS WHICH IT HAD INSTITUTED.  THIS TIME LIMIT,  HOWEVER,  DID NOT PRECLUDE POSSIBILITY OF SELF- DETERMINATION BEING EXERCISED BEFORE TEN YEAR DEADLINE.  IN ADDITION,  SELF- DETERMINATION FOR TERRITORY AS A WHOLE WAS NOT PRECLUDED.  AFTER MEETING WITH SCALI,  VON HIRSCHBERG TOLD MISOFF THAT ONE OF REASONS FOR PROPOSING TEN YEARS AS MORE LIKELY TIME FOR THE EXERCISE OF SELF- DETERMINATION IN TERRITORY WAS DUE TO FACT THAT WHITES IN NAMIBIA WERE FAR MORE INTRANSIGENT THAN WOULD BE EXPECTED AND THAT THIS IS ONE OF PROBLEMS SAG HAS TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT WHEN DISCUSSING FUTURE OF NAMIBIA. \n7.

HE NOTED SAG HAD UNPUBLISHED BUT WRITTEN AGREEMENT TO INCREASE PROJECT ASSISTANCE AFTER FIRST SR 72 MILLION,  GRANTED IN 1972,  WAS SPENT.  AS YET,  HOWEVER, YARG AND SAG AID OFFICE IN SANAA HAD BEEN ABLE TO SPEND ONLY SR 20  MILLION OF THIS SUM.\n4.  ALTHOUGH ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT HAD TOP PRIORITY, SAG ALSO RECOGNIZED NEED TO STRENGTHEN YARG MILITARILY. GEN.  QABBANI S VISIT HAD BEEN MOST SUCCESSFUL.  HE NOW HAD A LIST OF YARG MILITARY NEEDS.  SAG WOULD STUDY IT,  COST IT,  AND THEN AGREE WITH YARG ON APPRO- PRIATELY TRIMMED LONG- TERM ASSISTANCE PROGRAM,  WITH DUE REGARD NOT JUST TO COST OF EQUIPMENT,  BUT ANCILLARY COSTS OF TRAINING,  SUPPLY,  AND MAINTENANCE.  SAG WOULD ALSO RESPOND TO SHORT- TERM NEEDS.  TWO SHIPMENTS,  ONE TANKS AND ONE UNSPECIFIED,  HAD ALREADY ARRIVED.  HE AGREED WITH MY COMMENT THAT SAG RESPONSIVENESS HAD IMPORTANT PSYCHOLOGICAL AS WELL AS MILITARY IMPACT IN REASSURING YARG THAT IT CAN COUNT ON ITS FRIENDS . I ASSURED SAQQAF OF IMPORTANCE USG PLACES ON SAFE- GUARDING ARABIAN PENINSULA,  EXEMPLIFIED BY OUR CLOSE CONSULTATIONS WITH SAG IN JIDDA AND SANAA,  AS WELL OUR EFFORTS PROMOTE REGIONAL COOPERATION AMONG RED SEA AND PENINSULA STATES.\n5.  SAQQAF TOOK INTERESTING LINE THAT WE SHOULD CONCENTRATE ON STRENGTHENING YAR AND OMAN,  LEAVING PDRY ALONE TO COLLAPSE OF ITS OWN INTERNAL PROBLEMS. PROOF OF ITS WEAKNESS AND LACK OF DOMESTIC SUPPORT WAS USE OF COMMUNIST "" MERCENARIES"",  A HISTORICAL THROWBACK WHICH HAD NOT BEEN USED IN MIDDLE EAST SINCE FAROUK S EGYPT.  EFFORT TO OVERTHROW PDRY WOULD ONLY LEAD TO GREATER SOVIET INVOLVEMENT.\n6.  REALIZE THAT SAQQAF S SOPHISTICATED DIPLOMATIC VIEWS ARE NOT ENTIRE SAG POLICY TOWARDS PDRY AND YAR.

AT THE SECRETARY S LUNCH FOR FOREIGN MINISTER SCHEEL ON MAY 1  AMBASSADOR BRUNNER,  AT SCHEEL S REQUEST, SUMMARIZED GERMAN CONCERN ON THE ISSUE OF INVIOLABILITY OF BORDERS.   BRUNNER FIRST COMMENTED ON THE EXCELLENT COOPERATION BETWEEN THE FRG AND US DELEGATIONS IN HELSINKI.   HE SAID THAT IT MIGHT BE CONSIDERED THAT THE  CONFIDENTIAL\n2.   THE GERMAN HOPE,  BRUNNER SAID,  WAS THAT BY TAKING THE EXISTING SITUATION IN EUROPE AS A STARTING POINT IT WOULD BE POSSIBLE AS A RESULT OF A SECURITY CONFERENCE TO ESTABLISH A REAL DETENTE IN EUROPE INCLUDING INCREASED AND MORE EFFECTIVE CHANNELS OF COMMUNICATION BETWEEN EAST AND WEST.   IF THIS GOAL WERE NOT ACHIEVED ( AND BY IMPLICATION IF ONE DID NOT DEVOTE ENOUGH ATTENTION TO CSCE)  THE SOLE RESULT OF THE CONFERENCE MIGHT WELL BE\n3.   BRUNNER NOTED THAT THE PREPARATORY TALKS HAD BEEN MOVING ALONG QUITE WELL ON THE WHOLE.   HOWEVER,  IT WAS CLEAR THAT FOR THE SOVIETS THE TWO OBJECTIVES WERE TO BRING ABOUT AN AUTHORITATIVE RECOGNITION OF THE PRESENT FRONTIERS IN EUROPE AND TO ESTABLISH A PERMANENT ORGAN WITH SOME KIND OF SUPERVISORY FUNCTIONS WHICH WOULD GIVE THE USSR A DEGREE OF CONTROL IN WESTERN EUROPE. WHILE THE FRG WANTED TO "" START FROM REALITIES""  IT CONSIDERED IT ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL TO LINK THE PRINCIPLE OF INVIOLABILITY OF TERRITORIAL BORDERS DIRECTLY WITH THAT OF THE NON- USE OF FORCE.\n4.   BRUNNER CONTENDED THAT ON THE SURFACE IT WOULD APPEAR THAT THE SOVIETS HAD MOVED IN THE HELSINKI TALKS TOWARD THE WESTERN POSITION.   THEY HAD ACCEPTED HUMAN CONTACTS AT LEAST AS AN ITEM FOR DISCUSSION AND THEY HAD BEEN SHOWN QUITE CLEARLY THAT THE WESTERN SIDE WAS NOT PREPARED TO RUSH INTO A CONFERENCE.   THE ULTIMATE TACTICS OF THE SOVIETS,  HOWEVER,  WERE NOT YET CLEAR.\n5.   BRUNNER ARGUED THAT IF THE SOVIETS WERE ABLE TO INSERT A GRAY ZONE BETWEEN THE PRINCIPLES OF NON- USE OF FORCE AND THE INVIOLABILITY OF FRONTIERS THE RESULT WOULD BE A TERRITORIAL FREEZE IN EUROPE ENJOYING INTERNATIONAL  CONFIDENTIAL\n6.   MINISTER EGON BAHR ADDED THAT UNQUALIFIED ACCEPTANCE OF THE PRINCIPLE OF INVIOLABILITY OF BORDERS COULD INVALIDATE THE RIGHTS OF THE FOUR POWERS WHICH APPLY TO GERMANY AS A WHOLE INCLUDING ITS BORDERS.   ASSISTANT SECRETARY VAN WELL ADDED THAT THE SOVIETS FREQUENTLY REMARK THAT EACH AREA OF THE WORLD IS CHARACTERIZED BY ITS SPECIFIC PROBLEMS.   IN THE CASE OF EUROPE THEY SEE THE PROBLEM AS THAT OF FRONTIERS.\n7.   MINISTER SCHEEL EXPRESSED TO THE SECRETARY THE HOPE THAT THE US WOULD JOIN WITH THE FRG IN MAKING THE POINT TO THE USSR ON THE NECESSITY TO LINK THE INVIOLABILITY OF BORDERS SEQUENTIALLY WITH THE PRINCIPLE OF NON- USE OF FORCE.   HE NOTED THAT IN THE US/ SOVIET COMMUNIQUE ISSUED IN MOSCOW THE SEQUENCE HAD NOT BEEN MAINTAINED BUT THAT THE GERMANS HAD BEEN ABLE TO DO SO IN THEIR MOSCOW TREATY AND THEY DID NOT WISH TO SEE THIS ACHIEVE- MENT PREJUDICED IN CSCE.\n8.   THE SECRETARY EXPRESSED APPRECIATION FOR THE GERMAN POINT OF VIEW AND SAID HE THOUGHT THAT A FORMULATION SHOULD BE FOUND WHICH WOULD MAKE PERFECTLY CLEAR IN ANY DECLARATION OF PRINCIPLES WHAT THE WESTERN SIDE MEANT. BRUNNER AGREED,  NOTING THAT IT WAS NOT THE INTENTION TO ESTABLISH THE PRINCIPLE OF THE IMMUTABILITY OF FRONTIERS. THE SECRETARY STATED THAT WHAT WE REALLY MEAN IS THAT FORCE SHOULD NOT BE USED TO CHANGE BOUNDARIES.    WE SHOULD NOT ACCEPT TERMINOLOGY WHICH WAS LESS THAN CLEAR AND COULD LEAD TO ARGUMENTS IN THE FUTURE.\n9.   BRUNNER SAID THAT THE SECOND SOVIET OBJECTIVE IS TO ACHIEVE A PERMANENT ORGAN WHICH WOULD DEVELOP A NEW INSTITUTIONALIZED LAW FOR EUROPE,  DIFFERENTIATED FROM  CONFIDENTIAL\n",1052633

AT THIS POINT,  VORONTSOV STOPPED READING FROM HIS INSTRUCTIONS AND OBSERVED THAT GROMYKO WISHED HIM TO CALL PARTICULAR ATTENTION OF DEPARTMENT TO QUESTION OF INVIOLABILITY OF FRONTIERS.  THE ITALIAN PROPOSAL ON PRINCIPLEOF INTERSTATE RELATIONS,  WHICH IS IN EFFECT A NATO PROPOSAL,  DOES NOT LIST FRONTIER INVIOL-      SECRET        SECRET    ABILITY AS A SEPARATE PRINCIPLE,  BUT SUBORDINATES IT TO NONUSE OF FORCE.   IN THE US- SOVIET COMMUNIQUE,  HOWEVER,  FRONTIER INVIOLABILITY IS LISTED AS AN INDE-  PENDENT PRINCIPLE,  NOT SUBORDINATE TO ANY OTHER.   THE US DELEGATION IN HELSINKI HAD INDICATED THAT IT WAS NOT OPPOSED TO SEPARATE TREATMENT OF FRONTIER INVIOLABILITY IN THE RELEVANT TEXT,  BUT IT HAD NOT ACTIVELY SUPPORTED POSITION AGREED UPON AT MOSCOW SUMMIT AND REGISTERED IN US- SOVIET COMMUNIQUE.   GROMYKO,  THEREFORE,  HOPES THAT THE US WILL MAKE ITS POSITION CLEARER ON THIS ISSUE AND SHIFT FROM A PASSIVE TO A MORE ACTIVE POSTURE AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.   \n4.   VORONTSOV SAID THAT SOVIETS INTEND TO RAISE THIS PROBLEM ALSO WITH CERTAIN WESTERN EUROPEAN GOVERNMENTS WHICH HAD ACCEPTED INDEPENDENT TREATMENT OF FRONTIER INVIOLABILITY IN RECENT BILATERAL DOCUMENTS WITH THE SOVIETS.   HE MENTIONED SPECIFICALLY FRANCE AND THE FRG.   \n5.   STOESSEL RESPONDED THAT HE TOOK NOTE OF SOVIET APPROACH AND WOULD STUDY IT CAREFULLY.   WE,  TOO,  ATTACH GREAT IMPORTANCE TO MEETING LATE JUNE DATE FOR OPENING CSCE.   OUR DELEGATION HAS NOT BEEN PASSIVE IN HELSINKI,  BUT HAS ACTIVELY URGED UPON OTHERS A MORE RAPID PACE OF WORK.   WE BELIEVE THERE IS A REASONABLE PROSPECT THAT THE JUNE DATE CAN BE MET.   \n6.   HOWEVER,  STOESSEL WENT ON TO SAY,  WE SEE THE PROBLEM SOMEWHAT DIFFERENTLY AND BELIEVE THAT THE REAL IMPEDIMENT TO AN EARLY CONCLUSION OF THE HELSINKI TALKS LIES IN   THE SOVIET ATTITUDE ON THE THIRD AGENDA ITEM,  THE SO-  CALLED HUMAN CONTACTS ISSUE.   AMBASSADOR ZORIN S STATE-  MENTS ON THIS SUBJECT DURING THE CLOSING DAYS OF MPT ROUND THREE HAD BEEN SURPRISINGLY HARSH.   PRIOR TO THOSE INTERVENTIONS,  IT HAD APPEARED THAT THE PROSPECTS FOR FORWARD MOVEMENT WERE QUITE GOOD.   HOWEVER,  ZORIN S REMARKS HAD HAD EFFECT OF STIFFENING THE POSITIONS OF WESTERN PARTICIPANTS ON OTHER ISSUES,  INCLUDING THE FRONTIER INVIOLABILITY QUESTION.   GEORGE VEST HAD DIS-  CUSSED THIS MATTER WITH SOVIET AMBASSADOR MENDELEVICH     SECRET        SECRET    IN HELSINKI AT SOME LENGTH ON APRIL 6.   \n7.   PERHAPS,  STOESSEL OBSERVED,  THE SOVIETS HAD CALCU-  LATED THAT A STERN POSITION ON THE FREER MOVEMENT TOPIC WOULD BRING OTHER COUNTRIES TOWARD SOVIET POSITION ON THE FRONTIER INVIOLABILITY ISSUE.   IF THAT HAD INDEED BEEN THE SOVIET TACTIC,  IT REFLECTED A MISREADING OF THE TRUE SITUATION.   THE OUTLINES OF AN ACCEPTABLE COMPROMISE ON FRONTIER INVIOLABILITY ARE PRESENT ( A POINT STOESSEL REITERATED TWICE AT OTHER JUNCTURES DURING THIS CONVERSATION).   BUT FACT IS THAT THE SOVIET STAND ON HUMAN CONTACTS HAS HARDENED THE ATTITUDES OF OTHERS ON THE FRONTIERS QUESTION.   \n8.   THUS,  WE THINK IT WILL BE VERY USEFUL FOR THE SOVIETS TO HAVE THE BILATERAL DISCUSSIONS, WHICH VORONTSOV HAD MENTIONED, WITH OTHER PARTICIPANTS,    STOESSEL ADDED.   IF MOSCOW CAN SHOW SOME FLEXIBILITY ON THE HUMAN CONTACTS ISSUE,  THIS POINT SHOULD BE MADE IN APPROPRIATE CAPITALS AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.   THIS WOULD HELP MATERIALLY TO SPEED UP THE PACE OF WORK WHEN THE HELSINKI TALKS RESUME ON APRIL 25.   WE RECOGNIZE,  STOESSEL SAID,  THAT THE HUMAN CONTACTS ISSUE RAISES PROBLEMS FOR MOSCOW,  BUT WE BELIEVE THAT COMPROMISE LANGUAGE CAN BE FOUND IN HELSINKI.   WHAT IS REQUIRED,  HOWEVER,  IS A MORE POSITIVE TONE IN THE SOVIET APPROACH.   SOVIETS SHOULD RECOGNIZE THAT WESTERN GOVERN-  MENTS,  AND PARTICULARLY WESTERN EUROPEAN GOVERNMENTS,  ATTACH GREAT IMPORTANCE TO THIS ISSUE.   THEY WOULD BE CRITICIZED BY THEIR PARLIAMENTS AND PUBLIC OPINION IF THEY AGREED IN HELSINKI TO MANDATE TEXT THAT DID NOT HOLD OUT PROSPECT FOR SOME PROGRESS IN THIS AREA.   \n9.   VORONTSOV RESPONDED THAT THE PROBLEM LAY NOT WITH THE SOVIET DELEGATION AT HELSINKI,  BUT WITH SOME ON THE WESTERN SIDE WHO HAD ALLOWED THEMSELVES TO BE   CARRIED AWAY BY THEIR ENTHUSIASM FOR THIS ISSUE.  THESE DELEGATIONS WISHED TO DISCUSS "" CONCRETE WAYS AND MEANS""  FOR ACHIEVING PROGRESS IN THIS AREA.  SUCH DISCUSSIONS     SECRET        SECRET    WERE APPROPRIATE FOR THE COMMITTEE PHASE OF CSCE,  BUT SHOULD NOT BE ATTEMPTED AT HELSINKI.  MANDATE TEXT SUPPORTED BY THESE DELEGATIONS CONTAINS FAR TOO MUCH DETAIL.   \n0.  USNATO MAY BRIEF ALLIES ON THIS COVERSATION AS APPROPRIATE.    MISSION SHOULD INDICATE OUR INTEREST IN BEING INFORMED RE NATURE ANY SOVIET DEMARCHES ON MPT IN OTHER NATO CAPITALS.  AFTER  BRIEFING OF ALLIES IN NATO,  INFO ADDRESSEES IN NATO CAPITALS MAY ALSO DRAW ON THIS REPORT,  SUBJECT TO INDICATED CAVEATS,  IN RESPONSE TO INQUIRIES FROM HOST GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS.

POSITIONSSOBER,frus1969-76ve08d126,"1.  WITH BHUTTO SCHEDULED DEPART FOR IRAN MAY 10,  CONFIDENTIAL\n2.  BHUTTO CONFIRMED THIS GENERALLY FAVORABLE PICTURE  OF PAK- IRANIAN RELATIONS DURING INFORMAL MEETING WITH US IN EARLY MAY.  OVERALL RELATIONS,  HE\n3.  SEVERAL SOURCES OF GOP CONCERN OVER IRANIAN POLICIES HAVE,  HOWEVER, BEEN APPARENT RECENTLY.  ONE PARTICULAR POINT OF CONCERN HAS BEEN IRANIAN ENDORSE- MENT IN MARCH 18  IRANIAN- SOVIET JOINT COMMUNIQUE OF PRINCIPLE OF BREZHNEV COLLECTIVE SECURITY PROPOSAL.  GOP OFFICIALS HAVE REFERRED TO THIS ENDORSEMENT ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS IN THEIR TALKS WITH US,  EXPRESSING UNCERTAINTY AS TO WHAT IRANIANS MEANT BY IT.  CLARIFICATION APPARENTLY HAS BEEN SOUGHT AND RECEIVED FROM TEHRAN, BUT PAKS OBVIOUSLY HAVE NOT FOUND IT FULLY SATISFYING. BHUTTO BROUGHT UP TOPIC HIMSELF DURING RECENT INFORMAL MEETING WITH US.  IRAN,  PRESIDENT COMMENTED,  WAS STRONG AND WEALTHY COUNTRY WHICH MIGHT BE ABLE TO APPROVE BREZHNEV PROPOSAL IN PRINCIPLE WHILE OPPOSING IT "" IN DETAIL"".  AS FOR PAKISTAN, HOWVER,  THEY DO NOT ACCEPT IT IN PRINCIPLE"".  PRESIDENT ASSERTED FIRMLY.  CONFIDENTIAL\n4.  ANOTHER ITEM THAT HAS CAUSED SOME CONCERN HERE WAS SHAH S APRIL INTERVIEW WITH SULZBERGER AS REPORTED IN NEW YORK TIMES,  IN WHICH SHAH WAS QUOTED AS EXPRESSING FEAR THAT PAKISTAN WAS ON VERGE OF DISSOLUTION AND SAYING THAT HE HAD URGED INDIA TO HELP GOP CONTROL AUTONOMY MOVEMENTS IN FRONTIER AND BALUCHISTAN. SUBJECT HAS COME UP IN SEVERAL RECENT TALKS WITH PAK OFFICIALS.  BHUTTO HIMSELF REFERRED TO INTERVIEW IN  RECENT MEETING WITH US,  EXPRESSING MILD IRRITATION OVER SHAH S REPORTED COMMENTS.  IT SEEMED TO HIM, BHUTTO SAID WRYLY,  THAT "" SHAH SEES HIMSELF AS THE PRO- TECTOR OF PAKISTAN -  OR A CO- PROTECTOR WITH INDIA"".\n5.  BHUTTO S SOMEWHAT CRITICAL COMMENTS ON SULZBERGER ARTICLE HAVE NOT BEEN ECHOED IN ANY PUBLIC STATEMENTS BY PRO- GOVERNMENT FIGURES OR IN GOVERNMENT- CONTROLLED INFO MEDIA.  OPPOSITION LEADERS,  HOWEVER, HAVE PUBLICLY COMPLAINED ABOUT SHAH S QUOTED REMARK TO SULZBERGER THAT IRAN WOULD TAKE "" PROTECTIVE REACTION"" IN BALUCHISTAN SHOULD PAKISTAN DISINTEGRATE,  CHARGING HIM WITH DELIBERATE INTERFERENCE IN PAKISTAN S DOMESTIC AFFAIRS.  AT CONCLUSION ITS TWO- DAY MEETING IN QUETTA MAY 4,  CENTRAL WORKING COMMITTEE OF NATIONAL AWAMI PARTY ADOPTED RESOLUTION DEMANDING THAT "" STRONG PROTEST"" BE LODGED WITH IRAN OVER SHAH S REPORTED REMARK AND THAT "" SUITABLE STEPS""  BE TAKEN TO SAFEGUARD PAKISTAN S INTEGRITY.  GOVERNMENT- CONTROLLED PRESS,  WHICH CUSTOMARILY TAKES UNDEVIATING PRO- IRAN LINE,  HAS ROUNDLY CASTIGATED OPPOSITION FOR ATTEMPTING TO  DAMAGE PAK- IRANIAN TIES.\n6.  ANOTHER TOPIC LIKELY TO COME UP DURING BHUTTO VISIT IS THAT OF IRAN S RELATIONS WITH IRAQ. PRESIDENTLY RECENTLY OBSERVED TO US THAT PAKISTAN S REALTIONS WITH IRAQ HAD JUST BEEN PATCHED UP ( DURING VISIT BY IRAQI EDUCATION MINISTER)  AFTER PERIOD OF COOLNESS FOLLOWING FEBRUARY 10  DISCOVERY OF ARMS IN IRAQI CHANCERY.  HE SPEC- ULATED BRIEFLY THAT HE MIGHT BE ABLE TO HELP IN IMPROVING CHRON- ICALLY TENSE RELATIONS BETWEEN IRAN AND IRAQ,  IMPLYING THAT HE MIGHT EXPLORE TOPIC WHILE IN TEHRAN.  IN LIGHT SHAH S RECENT COMMENTS RE GOP LETTING IRAQIS OFF "" CHEAPLY""  OVER ARMS SMUGGLING ( TEHRAN 2915), APPEARS THAT BHUTTO MAY FIND SELF ON DEFENSIVE IF TOPIC ARRISES.\n7.  COMMENT:  BHUTTO S SOMEWHAT CRITICAL REMARKS RE MARCH 18  IRAN- SOV COMMUNIQUE AND SULZBERGER ARTICLE SHOULD NOT BE TAKEN TO SUGGEST ANY SERIOUS STRAINS IN CURRENT  CONFIDENTIAL     PAK - IRANIAN RELATIONS,  WHICH ARE FIRMLY BASED IN BOTH CAPITALS ON PERCEPTIONS OF OWN SELF- INTEREST.  THEY DO,  HOWEVER,  REFLECT SOME PUZZLEMENT WITH SHAH S CURRENT POSTURE VIS- A- VIS SOVIETS AND WITH HIS PORTRAYAL OF PAKISTAN AS ON VERGE OF DISSOLUTION.  WE HAVE IM- PRESSION THAT,  DESPITE LARGE AND GROWING IRANIAN MISSION HERE PLUS CONSTANT FLOW OF DELEGATIONS BACK AND FORTH,  SHAH IS NOT ESPECIALLY WELL- INFORMED OF CURRENT PICTURE IN PAKISTAN.  PART OF THIS MAY STEM FROM INADEQUACIES OF IRANIAN DIPLOMATIC AND INTELLIGENCE REPORTING FROM HERE.  AND IN PART,  IT MAY REFLECT LESS THAN FULL UNDERSTANDING ON SHAH S PART THAT BHUTTO IS OPERATING IN RELATIVELY OPEN POLITICAL CLIMATE,  WITH OPPOSITION PERMITTED DEGREE OF SELF- ASSERTION NOT CUSTOMARY IN IRAN.\n8.  SHAH MAY ALSO NOT FULLY REALIZE EXTENT TO WHICH HIS RECENT COMMENTS ON PAKISTAN TEND TO SOUND PATRONIZING TO PAKISTANI EARS.  BHUTTO IS A REALIST IN CONDUCT OF FOREIGN POLICY AND HE RECOGNIZES THAT IRAN ENJOYS DEGREE OF STABILITY AND AFFLUENCE UN- MATCHED SO FAR IN PAKISTAN.  AT SAME TIME --  AS SOME OF HIS FOREGOING REMARKS INDICATE --  HE TOO MAY BRIDLE AT WHAT HE PERCEIVES TO BE HINT OF PATERNALISM IN SHAH S ATTITUDE TOWARD PAKISTAN. SOBER\n",1053075

IN FURTHER CONSIDERATION OF THE REGISTRATION PROB- LEM,  THE MAIN DIFFERENCES HAVE OCCURRED BETWEEN THE FRG AND FRENCH SIDES.   THE FRENCH REP SAYS THAT HIS AUTHORI-  CONFIDENTIAL\n2.   THE FONOFF REP ( BLECH)  HAS ARGUED AGAINST ANY ALLIED ACTION WHICH WOULD AMOUNT NOW TO A DECISION ON HOW THE INNER- GERMAN ARRANGEMENTS ARE TO BE HANDLED.   ALTHOUGH TAKING NOTE OF ALLIED HESITATION TO CONSIDER FRG REGIS- TRATION OR FILING OF THE SENAT- GDR ARRANGEMENTS,  BLECH SAYS THE GERMAN SIDE FEELS MORE STUDY IS NECESSARY.   THEY WOULD THEREFORE PREFER A PROCEDURE WHICH WOULD LEAVE OPEN THE WESTERN POSITION HOW THE INNER- GERMAN ARRANGEMENTS SHOULD BE HANDLED BY THE TWO GERMAN STATES.   IN THE GERMAN VIEW THIS LEAVES TWO ALTERNATIVES:   A)   REGISTRA- TION OF THE QA AND FQP BY THE FOUR POWERS WITH NO ACTION BY THE TWO GERMAN STATES AT THIS TIME;  OR B)   REGISTRA- TION OF THE QA AND FQP AND FILING OF THE INNER- GERMAN ARRANGEMENTS BY THE THREE POWERS OR BY ONE OF THE THREE POWERS WITHOUT SOVIET PARTICIPATION.   IN ALL DISCUSSIONS, BLECH HAS STRESSED THAT IT IS ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY FOR THE FRG TO HAVE REGISTRATION COMPLETED BEFORE IT SUBMITS ITS APPLICATION FOR UN MEMBERSHIP.\n3.   THE RESULT OF THESE DISCUSSIONS HAS BEEN AGREEMENT TO RECOMMEND TO AUTHORITIES A FURTHER APPROACH TO THE SOVIET WHICH IS A SLIGHTLY REVISED VERSION OF THE PROPOSAL MADE IN PARA 3  OF REF ( B).   THE MAIN DIFFERENCE IS THAT INSTEAD OF THREATENING THE SOVIETS WITH A COUNTER STATEMENT IF THE GDR FILES THE SENAT- GDR ARRANGEMENTS,  THE THREE POWERS WOULD PROPOSE THAT THE QUESTION OF REGISTRATION OF ALL INNER- GERMAN ARRANGEMENTS BE DELAYED UNTIL AFTER THE FRG AND GDR HAVE ENTERED THE UN.\n4.   IN MAKING THIS PROPOSAL,  BLECH ADMITTED THAT IT WAS REALLY A STALLING TACTIC TO ENABLE US TO ACHIEVE REGIS-  CONFIDENTIAL\n5.   BONN GROUP REPS HAVE AGREED ON THE FOLLOWING OUTLINE OF A PRESENTATION,  WHICH WOULD BE MADE BY ASSISTANT SECRETARY STOESSEL IN WASHINGTON,  FOR RECOMMENDATION TO CAPITALS.   THE FINAL POINT CONCERNING A REGISTRATION OF THE INNER- GERMAN ARRANGEMENTS HAS BEEN LEFT VAGUE PURPOSELY BECAUSE BLECH SAYS HE CANNOT AT THIS TIME COMMIT THE FRG TO ANY ACTION,  NOT EVEN TO AN AGREEMENT TO RAISE THE SUBJECT WITH THE GDR.   THE POINTS ARE AS FOLLOWS:      1.   THE SOVIET REPLY OF APRIL 30  IS NOT ENTIRELY      SATISFACTORY.   WE CANNOT AGREE WITH THE TREATMENT      PROVIDED FOR THE INNER- GERMAN ARRANGEMENTS,  NOR  CONFIDENTIAL          CAN WE CO- MIT OTHER STATES TO A SPECIFIC ACTION.\n2.   WE CONTINUE TO BELIEVE THAT OUR INITIAL PRO-      POSAL FOR QUADRIPARTITE REGISTRATION AND FILING IS      IN ACCORDANCE WITH UN PROCEDURES,  THE NATURE OF THE\n3.   HOWEVER,  IN THE INTEREST OF EXPEDITING REGIS-      TRATION,  WE WOULD BE PREPARED TO ACCEPT THE SOVIET      PROPOSAL INSOFAR AS IT RELATES TO QUADRIPARTITE      REGISTRATION OF THE QUADRIPARTITE AGREEMENT AND THE      FINAL QUADRIPARTITE PROTOCOL,  WITH NO ACTION BEING      TAKEN BY THE FOUR POWERS ON THE INNER- GERMAN ARRANGE      MENTS.\n4.   CONCERNING THE SUPPLEMENTARY ARRANGEMENTS,  IT      WOULD APPEAR TO US MORE APPROPRIATE FOR BOTH GERMAN      STATES,  TO USE THE TIME REMAINING BEFORE THEIR ENTRY      INTO THE UNITED NATIONS TO CLOSELY EXAMINE THE      QUESTION OF REGISTRATION.   IN THIS CONNECTION,  ONE      ASPECT TO BE CONSIDERED IS WHETHER,  AND IF THE      OCCASION ARISES,  UNDER WHICH CIRCUMSTANCES,  A CO-      ORDINATED REGISTRATION OF THE SUPPLEMENTARY AGREE-      MENTS-- CONSISTENT WITH THE COMMON REGISTRATION OF THE QA AND THE FQP-- CAN BE CONSIDERED.\n6.   EMBASSY COMMENT:   WE BELIEVE THAT THE ABOVE PROPOSAL IS A LOGICAL DEVELOPMENT FROM OUR LAST PRESENTATION ( BONN 3249)  AND THE SOVIET RESPONSE.   WE ARE NOT,  HOWEVER SANGUINE THAT THE SOVIETS WILL AGREE TO GO ALONG.   IN BONN GROUP DISCUSSIONS WE HAVE MADE CLEAR OUR VIEW THAT CONSIDERATION SHOULD BE GIVEN TO ACTION BY THE WESTERN SIDE ALONE IF THE SOVIETS DO NOT SEEM WILLING TO AGREE TO REGISTRATION BEFORE SUBMISSION OF THE FRG MEMBERSHIP APPLICATION.   THE FRENCH REP CONTINUES TO SAY HIS AUTHOR- ITIES WILL NOT CONSIDER ANY ACTION WITHOUT THE SOVIETS. THIS SUGGESTS TO US THAT WE WILL SOON HAVE TO CONSIDER PLACING MORE PRESSURE ON THE FRENCH TO JOIN A TRIPARTITE ACTION OR TO CONSIDER A UNILATERAL STEP BY EITHER THE US  CONFIDENTIAL     OR UK TO MAKE SURE THAT REGISTRATION IS ACCOMPLISHED IN TIME.

WE ARE TRANSMITTING IN PARA 2  BELOW FOR CONSIDERATION BY EMBASSIES AND BONN GROUP REVISED DRAFT OF BK/ L ON EXTENSION TO BERLIN OF BASIC TREATY AND INNER- GERMAN ARRANGEMENTS.

CONSISTENT WITH VIEWS EXPRESSED BY BONN GROUP ( REF B),  IT IS FORMULATED WITHIN TERMS OF BKC/ L(52)6,  LONG- STANDING BASIC ALLIED LEGISLATION ON EXTENSION TO BERLIN OF INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENTS CONCLUDED BY FRG.  IT DOES NOT SEEK, AS DID EARLIER DRAFT,  TO DEVELOP NEW RULES APPLICABLE ONLY TO INNER- GERMAN AGREEMENTS.  SINCE AGREEMENTS BETWEEN FRG AND GDR CAN BE EXPECTED,  HOWEVER,  TO HAVE CONSIDERABLY  CONFIDENTIAL\n2.  TEXT OF DRAFT BK/ L IS AS FOLLOWS:\n1.  THE ALLIED KOMMANDATURA RAISES NO OBJECTION TO THE APPLICATION TO BERLIN,  SUBJECT TO THE RIGHTS AND RESPONSI- BILITIES OF THE ALLIED AUTHORITIES FOR BERLIN,  IN PARTICULAR THOSE INVOLVING SECURITY AND STATUS,  OF THE LAW RELATING TO THE TREATY ON THE BASIS OF RELATIONS BETWEEN THE FRG AND THE GDR,  WHICH CONTEMPLATES THE APPLICATION TO THE WESTERN SECTORS OF BERLIN OF CERTAIN CLAUSES OF THE TREATY AND OF ITS ATTACHED DOCUMENTS.  THESE ARRANGEMENTS PROVIDE THAT THE AGREEMENTS AND REGULATIONS REFERRED TO IN ARTICLE 7  OF THE TREATY MAY,  IN APPROPRIATE CASES,  BE EXTENDED TO THE WESTERN SECTORS OF BERLIN AND THAT THE FEDERAL REPUBLIC S PERMANENT MISSION TO THE GDR,  PROVIDED FOR IN ARTICLE 8, WILL REPRESENT THE INTERESTS OF THE WESTERN SECTORS OF BERLIN.\n2.  SUBJECT TO THE SAME RESERVATIONS,  THE ALLIED KOMMANDATURA AUTHORIZES THE REPRESENTATION BY THE FRG OF THE INTERESTS OF THE WSB WITH REGARD TO THE GDR.\n3.  SUBJECT TO THE ALLIED RIGHT OF CONTROL,  THE ALLIED KOMMANDATURA IS READY ALSO TO AUTHORIZE THE EXTENSION TO THE WSB OF APPROPRIATE AGREEMENTS OF THE FRG WITH THE GDR UNDER THE PROCEDURES LAID DOWN IN BKC/ L(52)6,  AS AMENDED.  HOWEVER,  IN VIEW OF THE PARTICULAR EFFECT FOR THE WESTERN SECTORS OF BERLIN WHICH THEIR INCLUSION IN FRG AGREEMENTS WITH THE GDR AND THE REPRESENTATION OF THEIR INTERESTS BY THE FRG WITH THE GDR MAY HAVE,  THE ALLIED KOMMANDATURA CALLS THE SENAT S ATTENTION TO THE IMPORTANCE OF PARAGRAPHS 1( A)5  AND 6  AND PARAGRAPH 1( B) OF ANNEX A TO BKC/ L(52)6.  IN PARTICULAR,  THE SENAT SHOULD UNDERTAKE TO NOTIFY AND CONSULT WITH THE ALLIED  CONFIDENTIAL\n3.

   BELIEVED IT WAS IN OUR MUTUAL INTEREST THAT WE REMAIN INVOLVED THOSE                            LEADERS IN BANGLADESH WITH WHOM WE HAD TALKED HAD MADE IT CLEAR THAT                            THEY

SUGGESTED WE SHOULD LOOK                            AT THE PROBLEM FROM THE PRACTICAL POINT OF VIEW IF BANGLADESH WOULD                            ASSUME SOME RESPONSIBILITY FOR A PORTION OF THE DEBT THE CREDITOR                            NATIONS WERE PREPARED TO CONSIDER GENEROUS RESCHEDULING SISCO POINTED OUT THAT THE DONOR NATIONS                            AT THE RECENT DACCA MEETING HAD TAKEN STRONG POSITION ON THIS ISSUE FOR                            OUR PART THE USG HOPED THE MATTER COULD                            BE RESOLVED FOR THE JUNE 30 DEADLINE WAS NOT FAR AWAY6 IN RESPONSE TO THE AMBASSADORS REQUEST FOR A GENERAL APPRAISAL                                SISCO SAID HE AND THE DEPUTY                            SECRETARY HAD RETURNED WITH AN IMPRESSION THAT A GENUINE SPIRIT OF                            RECONCILIATION EXISTS IN BANGLADESH INDIA AND PAKISTAN THE SIMLA                            AGREEMENT WAS A RATHER REMARKABLE ACHIEVEMENT TO EMERGE SO SOON AFTER                            THE END OF A BITTER WAR HE THOUGHT THAT THE NATIONS IN SOUTH ASIA NOW                            WERE ALL MOVING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION AND IN A DIRECTION WHICH WAS IN                            THEIR MUTUAL INTEREST HE THOUGHT HE COULD ASSURE THE AMBASSADOR THAT                            BANGLADESH WOULD FIND A GENUINE DISPOSITION IN PAKISTAN TO MOVE TOWARDS                            MORE NORMAL RELATIONS7 A SECOND GENERAL IMPRESSION HE AND THE DEPUTY SECRETARY FORMED WAS                            THAT ALL THE CONCERNED PARTIES IN THE SUBCONTINENTEACH IN HIS OWN                            WAYWERE KEENLY AWARE THIS IS A REGION IN WHICH THE MAJOR POWERS HAVE AN                            INTEREST ALL SEEMED TO AGREE THEY WISHED TO SEE THE UNITED STATES                            REMAIN INVOLVED FOR OUR PART WE HAVE ONE MAJOR INTEREST IN SOUTH ASIA:                            TO DO WHAT WE CAN TO CONTRIBUTE TO STABILITY WE SEEK NO SPECIAL                            INFLUENCE NEITHER IS IT IN OUR NATIONAL INTEREST TO SEE ANY ONE POWER                            DOMINATE THE AREA WE WISH TO PLAY A PART IN THE EVOLUTION OF                            COMPLEMENTARY RELATIONS AMONG THE MAJOR POWERS AND THE REGIONAL POWERS                            IN THE SUBCONTINENT8 SISCO ALSO SAID HE WAS                            ENCOURAGED BY THE POSITIVE CONTRIBUTION THE BANGLADESH GOVERNMENT AND                            THE LEADERS OF BANGLADESH HAD MADE IN THE SEARCH FOR PEACE AND STABILITY HE WAS HOPEFUL THAT                            BANGLADESH WOULD REMAIN FLEXIBLE AS NEGOTIATIONS DEVELOPED HE FIRMLY                            BELIEVED THAT PAKISTAN WISHED TO WORK OUT THE KIND OF RELATIONSHIP WITH                            BANGLADESH WHICH WOULD BE IN THE BEST INTEREST OF BOTH COUNTRIES9 ALI POINTED OUT THAT TIMING WAS AN IMPORTANT CONSIDERATION PAKISTAN                            HAD STILL NOT BROUGHT ITSELF TO RECOGNIZE THE EXISTENCE OF BANGLADESH                                BHUTTO WAS ALSO ARGUING THAT                            WAR CRIMES TRIALS WOULD STAND IN THE WAY OF RECONCILIATION BANGLADESH                            HAD BROUGHT CHARGES AGAINST ONLY A MINIMUM NUMBER OF PAKISTANIS MANY                            MORE WERE CULPABLE BUT HIS GOVERNMENT HAD ONLY CHARGED THOSE AGAINST                            WHOM INCONTROVERTIBLE EVIDENCE WAS AVAILABLE10 SISCO OBSERVED THAT THIS                            OBVIOUSLY WAS A MATTER WHICH MUST BE WORKED OUT BETWEEN BANGLADESH AND                            PAKISTAN BUT POINTED OUT THAT IT WAS DIFFICULT PROBLEM FOR BOTH SIDES                            CLEARLY THERE WERE EXCESSES DURING THE PERIOD NO ONE DENIED THIS                                BHUTTO HIMSELF HAD ADMITTED                            AS MUCH MUJIB FELT HE COULD NOT JUST WIPE THE SLATE CLEAN BUT                                BHUTTO WAS ALSO IN A                            DIFFICULT POSITION HE HAS DONE A REMARKABLE JOB OF CUSHIONING THE LOSS                            OF THE EAST HE HAS BEEN PREPARING THE GROUNDWORK FOR THE EVOLUTION OF A                            POSITIVE NEW RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE TWO COUNTRIES THIS WAS A DELICATE                            PROCESS AND ONE WHICH REQUIRED TIME THE PROBLEM WAS HOW TO PROCEED WITH                            THIS EFFORT WITH THE PROSPECT OF WAR CRIMES TRIALS STIRRING UP EMOTIONS                            ON BOTH SIDES THOUGH WE COULD NOT COUNSEL EITHER SIDE ON HOW TO WORK                            THIS OUT WE HOPED THIS WHOLE MATTER WOULD BE RESOLVED IN SOME MUTUALLY                            SATISFACTORY MANNER11 ALI ALSO POINTED TO THE BIHARI                            QUESTION AS AN ISSUE ON WHICH THE PAKISTANIS WERE NOT BEING HELPFUL                            SISCO REMARKED THAT THIS WAS ANOTHER PROBLEM ON WHICH THERE WOULD HAVE                            TO BE SOME GIVE AND TAKE HE WAS CONVINCED THE PAKISTANIS WOULD BE                            FORTHCOMING ON THE ISSUE OF REPATRIATION OF BENGALEES IN PAKISTAN HE                            WAS ALSO HOPEFUL THE BIHARI PROBLEM COULD BE RESOLVED BECAUSE OF THE                            SPIRIT OF RECONCILIATION SHARED BY ALL THE PARTIES12 ALI IN A GENERAL COMMENT SAID                            HE HAD SPENT MOST OF HIS ADULT LIFE EITHER ABROAD OR IN WEST PAKISTAN                            SERVING HIS COUNTRY IN THE DIPLOMATIC SERVICE HE HAD ALWAYS CONSIDERED                            HIMSELF TO BE A GOOD PAKISTANI THERE WERE MANY BENGALEES LIKE HIM WHO                            HAD BEEN DRIVEN TO SEEK SEPARATION ONLY BY THE ATROCITIES INFLICTED BY                            THE PAKISTAN ARMY HE STILL RECOGNIZED THAT EVENTUALLY GOOD RELATIONS WOULD NEED TO BE DEVELOPED                            BUT THE EVENTS OF 1971 WILL BE EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TO FORGET THE                            PROCESS HE THOUGHT WOULD REQUIRE AT LEAST A GENERATION OBVIOUSLY                            PAKISTANI RECOGNITION WOULD HELP IF PRESIDENT BHUTTO HAD TAKEN THIS MOVE RIGHT AWAY                            BY NOW NORMAL RELATIONS WOULD ALREADY HAVE STARTED TO DEVELOP SISCO COMMENTED HE WAS CONVINCED THAT                            IF THE POW ISSUE COULD BE SETTLED IT WOULD LEAD TO FURTHER CONCRETE                            STEPS TO IMPROVE RELATIONS13 COMPLETING HIS REVIEW OF HIS VISIT SISCO SAID THAT THE SHAH HAD EXPRESSED CONCERN REGARDING                            SOVIET INTENTIONS IN THE REGION THE SHAH FELT IT COULD NOT IGNORE SUCH                            DEVELOPMENTS AS THE SOVIET TREATIES WITH IRAQ AND INDIA THE IRAQI ARMS                            INCIDENT IN PAKISTAN AND SOVIET ACTIVITIES IN SOUTH YEMEN THE INDIAN                            OCEAN AND THE IRAQI PORT OF UMM QASR THE SHAH HAD FURTHER SAID IRAN                            WOULD BE CONCERNED AT ANY MOVE TO DISMEMBER PAKISTAN SISCO OBSERVED THAT DURING HIS CALL ON                            INDIAN FOREIGN MINISTER SINGH THE DEPUTY SECRETARY HAD MENTIONED IRANS                            CONCERN WITH SOVIET INTENTIONS SINGH HAD COMMENTED                            THAT TO THE EXTENT THAT INDIAN POLICY WAS A SOURCE OF IRANIAN CONCERN                            HIS COUNTRY WOULD NEED TO TRY TO DISPEL IRANIAN APPREHENSIONS YY,frus1969-76ve08d31,"1.   SUMMARY:   INDIAN CHARGE GONSALVES CALLED ON ASST SECY SISCO MAY 3  TO REVIEW HIS IMPRESSIONS OF RECENT TRIP TO SOUTH ASIA AND IRAN.   ASST SECY SISCO INDICATED THAT TRIP HAD BEEN GOOD.   WE HAD NOT EXPECTED DRAMATIC RESULTS,  BUT RETURNED HOPEFUL AND IMPRESSED BY INCREASED ATMOSPHERE OF RECONCILIATION IN MAJOR SOUTH ASIA CAPITALS. ALSO FOUND THAT US BILATERAL RELATIONS GOOD WITH ALL COUNTRIES.   END SUMMARY.\n2.   SISCO SAID THAT WE CONSIDERED INDO- BANGLADESH  CONFIDENTIAL\n3.   INDO- BANGLADESH OFFER OBVIOUSLY CREATED PROBLEMS FOR PAKS,  BUT WAS NEW AND FLEXIBLE APPROACH.   WE HAD NO SOLUTIONS OURSELVES.   INDIA,  PAKISTAN AND BANGLADESH SEEMED TO BE DOING WELL WITHOUT OUR HELP.   WE WOULD CON- TINUE TO PAT ALL SIDES ON BACK,  BUT REMAIN OUT OF DELIBERATIONS.   WE HOPED THEY WOULD ACHIEVE FURTHER PROGRESS.\n4.   SISCO WENT ON TO INDICATE POSITIVE IMPRESSIONS RECEIVED IN BOTH BANGLADESH AND PAKISTAN.   BANGLADESH OBVIOUSLY FACED MAJOR ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT PROBLEMS AND LACKED RESOURCES.   BUT IT HAD CHARISMATIC LEADERSHIP IN MUJIB BACKED BY REAL NATIONAL COMMITMENT.\n5.   BHUTTO HAD DONE REMARKABLE JOB IN CUSHIONING IMPACT OF 1971  IN PAKISTAN AND IN MOVING PUBLIC THERE TO ACCEPT NEW REALITIES.   PAKISTAN ECONOMY SEEMED IN SURPRISINGLY GOOD SHAPE WITH REAL PROSPECTS FOR FUTURE.   CONSTITUTIONAL CONSENSUS WAS MAJOR STEP.   WE THOUGHT INDIA SHOULD HAVE REAL INTEREST IN SUCCESS OF POPULAR- TYPE LEADERSHIP BHUTTO REPRESENTED.\n6.   AT SAME TIME,  SISCO SAID WE SENSED CONCERN IN PAKISTAN AND SOME WORRY IN IRAN ON SECURITY ISSUES.   HE DID NOT WANT TO OVERPLAY THESE BUT INDIA WITH ITS IN- CREASED POWER SHOULD BE AWARE OF APPREHENSIONS.   THEY RELATED PRIMARILY TO SOVIET ROLE IN PERSIAN GULF AND FACT OF INDO- SOVIET TREATY AND SOVIET- IRAQ TODAY.\n7.   SISCO NOTED THERE ALSO SOME ANXIETY ABOUT INDIA IN SMALLER NEIGHBORS.   HE DID NOT WANT TO EXAGGERATE THIS, BUT SIKKIM DEVELOPMENTS CAUSED OTHERS TO WONDER. GONSALVES COMMENTED THAT INDIA COULD NOT DO ANYTHING ABOUT DISPARITIES OF SIZE,  ETC.,  BUT WAS GENUINELY TRYING TO BUILD APOLITICAL BRIDGES AS WAY TO OVERCOME COMPLEXES  CONFIDENTIAL\n8.   REGARDING STOP IN DELHI,  SISCO SAID THIS PROVED VERY USEFUL.   BOTH SIDES MADE CLEAR THEIR INTEREST IN IMPROVING RELATIONS.   WE WERE PLEASED BY FRANK NATURE OF DIS- CUSSIONS.   BOTH SIDES CANDIDLY INDICATED AREAS OF AGREE- MENT AND DISAGREEMENT.   WE THOUGHT THIS WAS CORRECT WAY TO PROCEED IN DEVELOPING SOUNDER AND MORE REALISTIC RELATIONSHIP.\n9.   ON ARMS QUESTION,  SISCO COMMENTED THAT WE FELT INDIAN GOVERNMENT HAD KEPT US DECISION IN PERSPECTIVE EVEN IF OUR ACTIONS EXAGGERATED IN INDIAN PRESS.   CLEARLY ANYTHING US SOLD PAKISTAN IN RECENT YEARS MINISCULE IN COMPARISON WITH USSR SHIPMENTS TO INDIA.   SECRETARY RUSH S PRESENTA- TION WAS RESTATEMENT OF OUR POLICY AS ANNOUNCED IN MID- MARCH AND INDICATION OF WHAT WAS OBVIOUS:   THAT NO GOVERNMENT WOULD CLOSE OUT OPTIONS FOR FUTURE.\n0.

FLEXIBLE AS NEGOTIATIONS DEVELOPED HE FIRMLY                            BELIEVED THAT PAKISTAN WISHED TO WORK OUT THE KIND OF RELATIONSHIP WITH                            BANGLADESH WHICH WOULD BE IN THE BEST INTEREST OF BOTH COUNTRIES9 ALI POINTED OUT THAT TIMING WAS AN IMPORTANT CONSIDERATION PAKISTAN                            HAD STILL NOT BROUGHT ITSELF TO RECOGNIZE THE EXISTENCE OF BANGLADESH                                BHUTTO WAS ALSO ARGUING THAT                            WAR CRIMES TRIALS WOULD STAND IN THE WAY OF RECONCILIATION BANGLADESH                            HAD BROUGHT CHARGES AGAINST ONLY A MINIMUM NUMBER OF PAKISTANIS MANY                            MORE WERE CULPABLE BUT HIS GOVERNMENT HAD ONLY CHARGED THOSE AGAINST                            WHOM

RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE TWO COUNTRIES THIS WAS A DELICATE                            PROCESS AND ONE WHICH REQUIRED TIME THE PROBLEM WAS HOW TO PROCEED WITH                            THIS EFFORT WITH THE PROSPECT OF WAR CRIMES TRIALS STIRRING UP EMOTIONS                            ON BOTH SIDES THOUGH WE COULD NOT COUNSEL EITHER SIDE ON HOW TO WORK                            THIS OUT WE HOPED THIS WHOLE MATTER WOULD BE RESOLVED IN SOME MUTUALLY                            SATISFACTORY MANNER11 ALI ALSO POINTED TO THE BIHARI                            QUESTION AS AN ISSUE ON WHICH THE PAKISTANIS WERE NOT BEING HELPFUL                            SISCO REMARKED THAT THIS WAS ANOTHER PROBLEM ON WHICH THERE WOULD HAVE                            TO BE SOME GIVE AND TAKE HE WAS CONVINCED

BECAUSE OF THE                            SPIRIT OF RECONCILIATION SHARED BY ALL THE PARTIES12 ALI IN A GENERAL COMMENT SAID                            HE HAD SPENT MOST OF HIS ADULT LIFE EITHER ABROAD OR IN WEST PAKISTAN                            SERVING HIS COUNTRY IN THE DIPLOMATIC SERVICE HE HAD ALWAYS CONSIDERED                            HIMSELF TO BE A GOOD PAKISTANI THERE WERE MANY BENGALEES LIKE HIM WHO                            HAD BEEN DRIVEN TO SEEK SEPARATION ONLY BY THE ATROCITIES INFLICTED BY                            THE PAKISTAN ARMY HE STILL RECOGNIZED THAT EVENTUALLY GOOD RELATIONS WOULD NEED TO BE DEVELOPED                            BUT THE EVENTS OF 1971 WILL BE EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TO FORGET THE                            PROCESS HE THOUGHT WOULD REQUIRE AT LEAST A GENERATION OBVIOUSLY                            PAKISTANI RECOGNITION WOULD HELP IF PRESIDENT BHUTTO HAD TAKEN THIS MOVE RIGHT AWAY                            BY NOW NORMAL RELATIONS WOULD ALREADY HAVE STARTED TO DEVELOP SISCO COMMENTED HE WAS CONVINCED THAT                            IF THE POW ISSUE COULD BE SETTLED IT WOULD LEAD TO FURTHER CONCRETE                            STEPS TO IMPROVE RELATIONS13 COMPLETING HIS REVIEW OF HIS VISIT SISCO SAID THAT THE SHAH HAD EXPRESSED CONCERN REGARDING                            SOVIET INTENTIONS IN THE REGION THE SHAH FELT

HAD COMMENTED                            THAT TO THE EXTENT THAT INDIAN POLICY WAS A SOURCE OF IRANIAN CONCERN                            HIS COUNTRY WOULD NEED TO TRY TO DISPEL IRANIAN APPREHENSIONS

SUMMARY:   SPECIAL EMISSARY OF MUJIB,  M.  R.  SIDDIQUI,  MET WITH SECRETARY MAY 8  FOLLOWING WORKING LUNCHEON WITH DEPUTY SECRETARY.   SIDDIQUI REVIEWED RECENT INITIATIVE TAKEN BY BDG AND GOI ON HUMANITARIAN ISSUES WITH PAKISTAN,  EXPRESSED REGRETOVER PAKISTAN S RESPONSE AND PARTICULAR-  LY OVER ITS RECENT ACTION IN ROUNDUP BENGALEE CIVIL SERVANTS,  AND STATED BELIEF THAT "" WISE COUNSEL""  OF USG WOULD STRENGTHEN NEGOTIATING ATMOSPHERE.   SECRETARY RESPONDED THAT WE WOULD CONTINUE TO URGE     SPIRIT OF  LIMITED OFFICIAL USE      LIMITED OFFICIAL USE     ACCOMMODATION BUT THAT WE LOOKED TO PARTIES DIRECTLY CONCERNED TO COME UP WITH SOLUTIONS.   DEPSEC EXPRESSED HOPE TO SIDDIQUI THAT IN CONSIDERING WAR CRIMES ISSUE BDG WOULD GIVE DUE REGARD TO ITS IMPACT ON ATMOSPHERE OF RECONCILIATION ESSENTIAL TO FUTURE OF PEOPLES SOUTH ASIA.   END SUMMARY.   \n2.   SIDDIQUI ACCOMPANIED ON CALL BY AMBASSADOR ALI AND COUNSELOR MUHITH.   SISCO AND LAINGEN SAT IN.   \n3.   SECRETARY GAVE SIDDIQUI WARM WELCOME,  EXPRESSED APPRECIATION FOR HOSPITALITY RECENTLY SHOWN DEPSEC AND SISCO,  AND EXPRESSED OUR DESIRE CONTINUE STRENGTHENING RELATIONS WITH BANGLADESH AND TO ASSIST IN DEVELOPMENT  WITHIN OUR CAPABILITIES.   SIDDIQUI EXPRESSED GRATITE BDG FOR U. S.  ASSISTANCE AND RECIPROCATED SECRETARY S HOPE FOR CONTINUED GOOD RELATIONSHIP.   \n4.   SECRETARY ASKED FOR SIDDIQUI S ASSESSMENT OF OUTLOOK FOR NEGOTIATING PROCESS SOUTH ASIA.   SIDDIQUI RESPONDED THAT ATMOSPHERE WAS SOMETHING LIKE LONDON WEATHER;  CLOUDS ONE DAY AND SUNSHINE THE NEXT AND NEVER CERTAIN WHAT TO EXPECT.   BANGLADESH AND INDIA HAD MADE MAJOR EFFORT TO GET THINGS MOVING IN RECENT DECLARATION.  BHUTTO HAD RESPONDED NOT WITH GOOD WILL BUT WITH MOST UNFORTUNATE STEP OF ROUNDING UP BENGALEES IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT.   BENGALEES BEING HELD BY BHUTTO AS HOSTAGES ALTHOUGH THEY GUILTY OF NO WRONG DOING.  MUJIB HAD CONSISTENTLY INDICATED READINESS TO WORK TOWARD PEACE BUT GOT NO RESPONSE FROM BHUTTO.   SIDDIQUI DID NOT KNOW WHAT FUTURE MIGHT HOLD BUT HE FELT THAT WISE COUNSEL TO BHUTTO FROM US WOULD HELP BRING BACK PEACE AND NORMALCY.   \n5.   SECRETARY RESPONDED THAT IN OUR CONTINUING DISCUS-  SIONS WITH SOUTH ASIAN GOVERNMENTS WE HAD STRESSED THE NEED FOR PROGRESS TOWARD PEACE AND WOULD CONTINUE TO DO SO.   WE COULD NOT PASS JUDGEMENT ON PARTICULAR ISSUES SINCE WE FELT STRONGLY THAT SOLUTIONS SHOULD BEST BE FOUND BY THE PARTIES DIRECTLY CONCERNED.   IN FINAL ANALYSIS THE NATIONS OF THE AREA WOULD HAVE TO  LIMITED OFFICIAL USE      LIMITED OFFICIAL USE     FIND THESE SOLUTIONS THEMSELVES IF THEY WERE TO LIVE TOGETHER IN PEACE.   US INTEREST WAS PEACE AND ALSO THE BEST POSSIBLE RELATIONS WITH EACH OF PARTIES CONCERNED.  WE WERE ENCOURAGED BY RECENT DEVELOPMENTS AND FELT THAT INDO/ BANGLADESH DECLARATION WAS A VERY FORTHCOMING PROPOSAL.   \n6.   SISCO REITERATED OUR VIEW THAT DECLARATION WAS VERY DEFINITE STEP FORWARD.   HE NOTED THAT HE AND DEPSEC DURING RECENT VISIT TO ISLAMABAD HAD FOUND THAT BHUTTO ALSO REGARDED IT AS A STEP AHEAD,  ESPECIALLY DELINKING OF RECOGNITION FROM HUMANITARIAN ISSUES.   THEREFORE WE HOPED BDG WOULD NOT ATTACH TOO MUCH WEIGHT TO WHAT MAY WELL BE MAINLY TACTICAL DEVELOPMENTS OF RECENT DAYS BUT FOCUS RATHER ON FACT THAT ALL THREE PRINCIPALS APPEARED NOW TO BE INTERESTED RESUMING NEGOTIATING PROCESS.   \n7.   SISCO NOTED ALSO THAT BHUTTO HAD EMPHASIZED UNDERLYING AFFINITY BETWEEN PAKISTAN AND BANGLADESH,  HIS RECOGNITION OF REALITY OF BANGLADESH,  AND HIS HOPE FOR GOOD RELATION-  SHIP.   SISCO SAID US COULD UNDERSTAND WHY BDG FELT DEEPLY ABOUT EXCESSES COMMITTED IN BANGLADESH BUT NOTED THAT WAR CRIMES TRIALS CLEARLY ARE A SENSITIVE ISSUE FOR BHUTTO AND THAT HE APPEARS TO BE TRYING TO PROCEED CAREFULLY IN CUSHIONING THEIR IMPACT IN PAKISTAN.   ON WHOLE,  BOTH HE AND DEPSEC HAD FOUND MOOD IN PAKISTAN VERY POSITIVE TOWARD BANGLADESH.   \n8.   SIDDIQUI EXPRESSED HOPE THAT THIS ASSESSMENT CORRECT.  BD WAS NOT PURSUING WAR CRIMES ISSUE OUT OF REVENGE BUT OUT OF BELIEF THAT FUNDAMENTAL HUMAN RIGHTS WERE INVOLVED AND THAT AN ELEMENTARY SENSE OF JUSTICE NEEDED TO BE MET.   BDG WOULD PROCEED WITH MODERATION,  TRIALS WOULD BE COMPLETELY OPEN TO WORLD COMMUNITY.   \n9.   SIDDIQUI NOTED SOME SURPRISE OVER BHUTTO S RIGID REJECTION OF LIMITED WAR CRIMES TRIALS THAT BDG NOW PROPOSED,  PARTICULARLY IN VIEW OF REPORTED PUBLIC COMMENT BY PAK AMBASSADOR IN PEKING WHILE RECENTLY IN HONG KONG TO EFFECT THAT PAKISTAN NOT OPPOSED TO TRIAL  LIMITED OFFICIAL USE      LIMITED OFFICIAL USE     OF 200  POW S ( SIDDIQUI HANDED SECRETARY CLIPPING FROM TIMES OF INDIA,  APRIL 28).   \n0.  LAINGEN NOTED THAT ASIDE FROM PROBLEM THAT WAR CRIMES TRIALS REPRESENTED,  PAK RESPONSE TO DECLARATION HAD ON WHOLE BEEN POSITIVE IN SENSE THAT PAKISTAN HAD INDICATED ITS READINESS TO BEGIN DIALOGUE ON HUMANITARIAN AND OTHER PROBLEMS WITH INDIANS.   SECRETARY INDICATED THAT BASED ON ITS OWN EXPERIENCE USG FOUND SOME DIFFI-  CULTY WITH BDG POSITION THAT IT COULD NOT TALK WITH GOP PRIOR TO RECOGNITION.   USG HAD HAD SOME EXPERIENCE WITH CONCEPT OF TALKING IN ABSENCE OF RECOGNITION.  AS A LAWYER,  SECRETARY WOULD ARGUE THAT THE MERE FACT OF A READINESS TO TALK ON THE PART OF GOP WAS IN EFFECT RECOGNITION ON ITS PART OF BANGLADESH.   NONETHELESS WE WOULD NOT PROPOSE TO SUGGEST TO BDG OR ANY OTHER PARTY HOW TO RESOLVE THIS OR OTHER PROBLEMS.   US HOPED SIMPLY THAT THERE WOULD NOW BE PROGRESS TOWARD PEACE;  WE HOPED ESPECIALLY FOR PROGRESS ON THE POW ISSUE;  BANGLADESH/ INDIAN DECLARATION HAD BEEN A FORTHCOMING AND PROGRESSIVE STEP AND WE HOPED IT WOULD NOW BEGIN TO PRODUCE RESULTS.   SIDDIQUI RESPONDED THAT BDG  APPRE-  CIATED SYMPATHETIC ATTITUDE SHOWN BY USG AND HOPED THAT SUCH ATTITUDE WOULD CONTINUE TO BE SHOWN.   IN THIS CONNECTION HIS GOVERNMENT PARTICULARLY APPRECIATED STATEMENT IN PRESIDENT NIXON S FOREIGN POLICY REPORT CONCERNING RECOGNITION OF BANGLADESH.   \n1.   SIDDIQUI ALSO MET WITH DEPSEC RUSH DURING WORKING LUNCHEON HOSTED BY LATTER.   DURING CONVERSATION SIDDIQUI REVIEWED BDG POSITION ALONG SAME LINES AS ABOVE.  DEPSEC INDICATED FULL AWARENESS OF CONCERN FELT DURING 1971  OF EXCESSES BY PAKISTANI SOLDIERS IN BD BUT EXPRESSED HOPE THAT BD WOULD ALSO CONSIDER CAREFULLY IMPACT OF WAR CRIMES TRIALS ON NEGOTIATING ATMOSPHERE AND ON FUTURE PAK/ BDG RELATIONSHIP.   WE HAD HAD OUR OWN EXPERIENCE WITH WAR CRIMES TRIALS AND ON THAT BASIS WE FELT WE COULD LEGITIMATELY POSE THE QUESTION WHETHER THE GREATER GOOD WAS SERVED BY SUCH TRIALS,  OR BY ACTIONS AND POLICIES THAT GAVE PRIORITY TO ATMOSPHERE OF RECONCILIATION AND ACCOMMODATION.   DEPUTY SECRETARY  LIMITED OFFICIAL USE      LIMITED OFFICIAL USE     ALSO ASKED SIDDIQUI TO CONVEY HIS WARMEST REGARDS TO PRIME MINISTER AND FOREIGN MINISTER AND HIS APPRECIA-  TION FOR HOSPITALITY SHOWN DURING DACCA VISIT.

CEASE- FIRE WAS IN ITS 34 TH MONTH AND JORDAN WAS MORE STABLE.  SITUATION IN LEBANON WAS UNCERTAIN AND WE EXPECTED IT TO BE SO IN FORESEEABLE FUTURE.   NEVERTHELESS,  SITUATION ALONG LEBANESE- ISRAELI BORDER WAS BETTER THAN IT HAD BEEN FORMERLY AND AGREEMENT RECENTLY REACHED BETWEEN LEBANESE GOV AND FEDAYEEN WAS BETTER THAN CAIRO AGREEMENT.   THROUGH-   CONFIDENTIAL      OUT RECENT CRISIS,  BOTH GOL AND ARMY HAD HELD UPPER HAND AND HAD DISPLAYED COURAGEOUS LEADERSHIP.   GOL HAD SHOWED INTEREST IN IMPROVING AND STRENGTHENING MILITARY,  WHICH, OF COURSE,  WOULD BE LONGER RANGE GOAL,  AND US WOULD BE AS RE-  SPONSIVE AS POSSIBLE.   GOL S OBJECTIVE WAS NOT TO ANNIHI-  LATE FEDAYEEN,  BUT TO CREATE REASONABLE COEXISTENCE WITH-  OUT CREATION OF STATE WITHIN A STATE AND ALL PROBLEMS THAT THAT ENTAILED. \n3.   SISCO CONTINUED BY NOTING THAT SITUATION ON SYRIAN-  ISRAELI BORDER WAS MORE PEACEFUL THAN PREVIOUSLY:   GOS SEEMED TO BE EXERTING REASONABLE REIN ON FEDAYEEN.   AS LONG AS THERE WERE NOT ANY OUTSIDE INFLUENCE IN LEBANON WHICH WOULD UPSET DELICATE BALANCE,  ISRAEL HAD STATED IT WOULD NOT BE INVOLVED.    IT IMPORTANT TO REALIZE IMPACT OF LAST YEAR; S SUMMIT ON AREA,  SISCO ADDED.   MEANING OF SUMMIT WAS THAT US AND USSR WOULD NOT GO TO WAR OVER AREA.   CONCOMITANTLY,  USSR HAD MADE IMPROVEMENT ITS RELATIONS WITH US ITS NUMBER ONE PRIORITY.   USSR INTEREST IN CEASE- FIRE REMAINED SAME.  AMOUNT OF INFLUENCE OR CONTROL BY MAJOR POWERS IN AREA WAS NOT COMMENSURATE;  NEITHER US NOR USSR COULD WAVE MAGIC WAND AND HAVE EVERYONE LINE UP ACCORDING TO THEIR WISHES.   HOWEVER,  DESPITE PARALLELISM OF INTERESTS BE-  TWEEN US AND USSR,  SOVIETS CONTINUED TO PROBE AT NUMEROUS PLACES WITHIN AREA IN ORDER EXERT THEIR INFLUENCE AND CONTROL.   US DID NOT ASSUME THIS TR ND WOULD NOT CONTINUE.   \n5.   FUNDAMENTAL OBJECTIVE OF US,  SISCO STATED WAS TO PLAY ROLE IN RESOLUTION OF ARAB- ISRAELI DISPUTE,  NOT BE-  CAUSE WE THOUGHT THERE WAS GOING TO BE WAR,  BUT BECAUSE WE BELIEVED IT TO BE IN OUR OWN INTEREST.   THE US WAS DEEPENING ITS ECONOMIC AND DIPLOMATIC TIES WITH NUMEROUS ARAB STATES.   \n6.   AMB HALUSA ASKED ABOUT LIBYA.   SISCO REPLIED US WAS CONTINUING TO PLAY LOW- KEY ROLE AND ATTEMPTING TO PREVENT FINAL BREAK.   \n7.   SISCO STATED THAT US BELIEVED NO REAL PROGRESS COULD BE MADE IN RESOLVING ARAB- ISRAEL DISPUTE UNTIL THERE WAS  CONFIDENTIAL      SERIOUS NEGOTIATING PROCESS UNDER WAY BETWEEN PARTIES INVOLVED.   THEREFORE,  WE VIEWED OUTSIDE ATTEMPTS AT RE-  SOLVING CRISIS AS DIVERSIONARY AND SERVING TO LIFT SOME OF PRESSURE FROM PARTIES INVOLVED.   MOREOVER,  SISCO ADDED,  ONLY WAY US CAN PLAY CONSTRUCTIVE ROLE WHICH TOOK INTO ACCOUNT LEGITIMATE INTERESTS BOTH SIDES WAS TO ENCOURAGE SERIOUS NEGOTIATING PROCESS.   WE UNDERSTOOD AND WERE WILLING TO FACE POSSIBLE STRAIN ON US- ISRAEL RELATIONS ENGENDERED BY SUCH PROCESS,   BUT ONLY WHEN NEGOTIATIONS WERE UNDER WAY.   US WAS NOT WILLING TO PREPARE BLUEPRINT;  EVEN IF IT HAD ONE,  IT DID NOT HAVE LEVERAGE TO IMPLEMENT IT.   \n8.   RES 242  IS ONE REMAINING FRAMEWORK IN WHICH US SAW POSSIBILITY OF WORKING TOWARD SETTLEMENT.   US VIEWED FORTH-  COMING SC MEETING WITH HOPE NOTHING WOULD BE DONE TO WEAKEN SC RES 242  AND ONGOING EFFORTS TO GET A SERIOUS NEGOTIATING PROCESS STARTED.   US VIEWS SECRETARY GEN-  ERAL S REPORT AS CAREFULLY COUCHED DOCUMENT,  BUT US WOULD OPPOSE ESTABLISHMENT OF ANY NEW UN MACHINERY.   IF THERE WERE MOVEMENT TO RESTORE JARRING MISSION,  US WOULD SUPPORT IT.   US WILL BE OPENMINDED ABOUT POSSIBILITY OF ROLE FOR SEC GEN.   \n9.   AMB JANKOWITSCH SAID HE UNDERSTOOD WHY US DID NOT WANT SC DEBATE BE USED TO DISTRACT FROM US ATTEMPTS TO RESOLVE ARAB- ISRAEL DISPUTE,  AND HE APPRECIATED SISCO S OPTIMISM.  SISCO INTERJECTED THAT HE HAD NOT USED WORD "" OPTIMISTIC""  NOR HAD HE USED WORD PESSIMISTIC TO CHARACTERIZE US EFFORTS.   \n0.   AMB HALUSA ASKED FOR OUR ASSESSMENT OF EGYPT S MOTIVES IN REQUESTING FORTHCOMING DEBATE.   SISCO REPLIED HE SAW TWO:  (1)  TO SERVE INTERNAL EGYPTIAN PURPOSES BY CREAT-  ING FEELING SOMETHING WAS HAPPENING AND (2)  EGYPTIANS WOULD LIKE SOMETHING FROM UN,  PERHAPS PRESSURE ON US.  SISCO SAID IT WAS POSSIBLE THAT EGYPTIAN EFFORT WAS DIRECTED TO FORTHCOMING SUMMIT AND WAS PART OF OVERALL EGYPTIAN CAMPAIGN TO ATTRACT ATTENTION OF MAJOR POWERS.  EGYPTIANS WERE CONCERNED THAT US AND USSR WERE PUTTING THEIR RELATIONS ABOVE ME.   CONFIDENTIAL     11.   AMB HALUSA WONDERED WHAT FRENCH GAME WAS AND AMB JANKOWITSCH ADDED PERHAPS WE SHOULD LOOK AT ENTIRE EURO-  PEAN ROLE IN FORTHCOMING DEBATE.   SISCO REPLIED THAT TO EXTENT TO WHICH DEBATE CREATES UNITY IN EUROPEAN POSITIONS AND PULLS US IN THEIR DIRECTION,  EGYPTIAN PURPOSES WOULD BE SERVED.   \n2.   AMB JANKOWITSCH SAID AUSTRIA ENJOYED EXCELLENT RELA-  TIONS WITH ALL ARAB STATES AND ISRAEL AS WELL.   AUSTRIA WAS ANXIOUS TO HELP,  TO BE CONSTRUCTIVE,  AND TO MAKE CON-  TRIBUTION TO RESOLUTION OF ARAB- ISRAEL DISPUTE.   AMB JAN-  KOWITSCH WENT ON TO SAY US HAS BEEN COURAGEOUS IN ITS EFFORTS IN PURSUING SETTLEMENT.   HOWEVER,  SOVIET UNION HAD BEEN LESS RESPONSIVE,  AND BY ITS ACTIONS IT HAD ENCOURAGED NONALIGNED STATES TO FOLLOW ITS LEAD.   \n3.   SISCO CONCLUDED BY SAYING US WOULD BE APPROACHING SC MEETING IN CONSTRUCTIVE MANNER AND WOULD NOT OPPOSE RENEW-  AL OF JARRING MISSION OR ROLE FOR SEC GEN AS LONG AS THERE WAS NOT ANY CHANGE IN RES 242.

FORWARD ESPECIALLY WITH RESPECT THAT THE POLITICAL ISSUE OF RECOGNITION                            WAS DELINKED FROM POW QUESTIONS SISCO SAID HE WAS PLEASED THAT IT HAD BEEN RECOGNIZED AS                            SUCH BY PAKISTAN3 ALI REMARKED THAT PAKISTAN                            UNFORTUNATELY STILL WITHHELD RECOGNITION EVEN THE PAKISTANI REPLY TO                            HIS GOVERNMENTS

OF DIVISION OF DEBT                            DEPUTY SECRETARY RUSH AND HE HAD                            POINTED OUT WE HAD TRIED TO BE HELPFUL WITH OUR ASSISTANCE EFFORT AND                            BELIEVED IT WAS IN OUR MUTUAL INTEREST THAT WE REMAIN INVOLVED THOSE                            LEADERS IN BANGLADESH WITH WHOM WE HAD TALKED HAD MADE IT CLEAR THAT                            THEY

SUGGESTED WE SHOULD LOOK                            AT THE PROBLEM FROM THE PRACTICAL POINT OF VIEW IF BANGLADESH WOULD                            ASSUME SOME RESPONSIBILITY FOR A PORTION OF THE DEBT THE CREDITOR                            NATIONS WERE PREPARED TO CONSIDER GENEROUS RESCHEDULING SISCO POINTED OUT THAT THE DONOR NATIONS                            AT THE RECENT DACCA MEETING HAD TAKEN STRONG POSITION ON THIS ISSUE FOR                            OUR PART THE USG HOPED THE MATTER COULD                            BE RESOLVED FOR THE JUNE 30 DEADLINE WAS NOT FAR AWAY6 IN RESPONSE TO THE AMBASSADORS REQUEST FOR A GENERAL APPRAISAL                                SISCO SAID HE AND THE DEPUTY                            SECRETARY HAD RETURNED WITH AN IMPRESSION THAT A GENUINE SPIRIT OF                            RECONCILIATION EXISTS IN BANGLADESH INDIA AND PAKISTAN THE SIMLA                            AGREEMENT WAS A RATHER REMARKABLE ACHIEVEMENT TO EMERGE SO SOON AFTER                            THE END OF A BITTER WAR HE THOUGHT THAT THE NATIONS IN SOUTH ASIA NOW                            WERE ALL MOVING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION AND IN A DIRECTION WHICH WAS IN                            THEIR MUTUAL INTEREST HE THOUGHT HE COULD ASSURE THE AMBASSADOR THAT                            BANGLADESH WOULD FIND A GENUINE DISPOSITION IN PAKISTAN TO MOVE TOWARDS                            MORE NORMAL RELATIONS7 A SECOND GENERAL IMPRESSION HE AND THE DEPUTY SECRETARY FORMED WAS                            THAT ALL THE CONCERNED PARTIES IN THE SUBCONTINENTEACH IN HIS OWN                            WAYWERE KEENLY AWARE THIS IS A REGION IN WHICH THE MAJOR POWERS HAVE AN                            INTEREST ALL SEEMED TO AGREE THEY WISHED TO SEE THE UNITED STATES                            REMAIN INVOLVED FOR OUR PART WE HAVE ONE MAJOR INTEREST IN SOUTH ASIA:                            TO DO WHAT WE CAN TO CONTRIBUTE TO STABILITY WE SEEK NO SPECIAL                            INFLUENCE NEITHER IS IT IN OUR NATIONAL INTEREST TO SEE ANY ONE POWER                            DOMINATE THE AREA WE WISH TO PLAY A PART IN THE EVOLUTION OF                            COMPLEMENTARY RELATIONS AMONG THE MAJOR POWERS AND THE REGIONAL POWERS                            IN THE SUBCONTINENT8 SISCO ALSO SAID HE WAS                            ENCOURAGED BY THE POSITIVE CONTRIBUTION THE BANGLADESH GOVERNMENT AND                            THE LEADERS OF BANGLADESH HAD MADE IN THE SEARCH FOR PEACE AND STABILITY HE WAS HOPEFUL THAT                            BANGLADESH WOULD REMAIN FLEXIBLE AS NEGOTIATIONS DEVELOPED HE FIRMLY                            BELIEVED THAT PAKISTAN WISHED TO WORK OUT THE KIND OF RELATIONSHIP WITH                            BANGLADESH WHICH WOULD BE IN THE BEST INTEREST OF BOTH COUNTRIES9 ALI POINTED OUT THAT TIMING WAS AN IMPORTANT CONSIDERATION PAKISTAN                            HAD STILL NOT BROUGHT ITSELF TO RECOGNIZE THE EXISTENCE OF BANGLADESH                                BHUTTO WAS ALSO ARGUING THAT                            WAR CRIMES TRIALS WOULD STAND IN THE WAY OF RECONCILIATION BANGLADESH                            HAD BROUGHT CHARGES AGAINST ONLY A MINIMUM NUMBER OF PAKISTANIS MANY                            MORE WERE CULPABLE BUT HIS GOVERNMENT HAD ONLY CHARGED THOSE AGAINST                            WHOM INCONTROVERTIBLE EVIDENCE WAS AVAILABLE10 SISCO OBSERVED THAT THIS                            OBVIOUSLY WAS A MATTER WHICH MUST BE WORKED OUT BETWEEN BANGLADESH AND                            PAKISTAN BUT POINTED OUT THAT IT WAS DIFFICULT PROBLEM FOR BOTH SIDES                            CLEARLY THERE WERE EXCESSES DURING THE PERIOD NO ONE DENIED THIS                                BHUTTO HIMSELF HAD ADMITTED                            AS MUCH MUJIB FELT HE COULD NOT JUST WIPE THE SLATE CLEAN BUT                                BHUTTO WAS ALSO IN A                            DIFFICULT POSITION HE HAS DONE A REMARKABLE JOB OF CUSHIONING THE LOSS                            OF THE EAST HE HAS BEEN PREPARING THE GROUNDWORK FOR THE EVOLUTION OF A                            POSITIVE NEW RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE TWO COUNTRIES THIS WAS A DELICATE                            PROCESS AND ONE WHICH REQUIRED TIME THE PROBLEM WAS HOW TO PROCEED WITH                            THIS EFFORT WITH THE PROSPECT OF WAR CRIMES TRIALS STIRRING UP EMOTIONS                            ON BOTH SIDES THOUGH WE COULD NOT COUNSEL EITHER SIDE ON HOW TO WORK                            THIS OUT WE HOPED THIS WHOLE MATTER WOULD BE RESOLVED IN SOME MUTUALLY                            SATISFACTORY MANNER11 ALI ALSO POINTED TO THE BIHARI                            QUESTION AS AN ISSUE ON WHICH THE PAKISTANIS WERE NOT BEING HELPFUL                            SISCO REMARKED THAT THIS WAS ANOTHER PROBLEM ON WHICH THERE WOULD HAVE                            TO BE SOME GIVE AND TAKE HE WAS CONVINCED THE PAKISTANIS WOULD BE                            FORTHCOMING ON THE ISSUE OF REPATRIATION OF BENGALEES IN PAKISTAN HE                            WAS ALSO HOPEFUL THE BIHARI PROBLEM COULD BE RESOLVED BECAUSE OF THE                            SPIRIT OF RECONCILIATION SHARED BY ALL THE PARTIES12 ALI IN A GENERAL COMMENT SAID                            HE HAD SPENT MOST OF HIS ADULT LIFE EITHER ABROAD OR IN WEST PAKISTAN                            SERVING HIS COUNTRY IN THE DIPLOMATIC SERVICE HE HAD ALWAYS CONSIDERED                            HIMSELF TO BE A GOOD PAKISTANI THERE WERE MANY BENGALEES LIKE HIM WHO                            HAD BEEN DRIVEN TO SEEK SEPARATION ONLY BY THE ATROCITIES INFLICTED BY                            THE PAKISTAN ARMY HE STILL RECOGNIZED THAT EVENTUALLY GOOD RELATIONS WOULD NEED TO BE DEVELOPED                            BUT THE EVENTS OF 1971 WILL BE EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TO FORGET THE                            PROCESS HE THOUGHT WOULD REQUIRE AT LEAST A GENERATION OBVIOUSLY                            PAKISTANI RECOGNITION WOULD HELP IF PRESIDENT BHUTTO HAD TAKEN THIS MOVE RIGHT AWAY                            BY NOW NORMAL RELATIONS WOULD ALREADY HAVE STARTED TO DEVELOP SISCO COMMENTED HE WAS CONVINCED THAT                            IF THE POW ISSUE COULD BE SETTLED IT WOULD LEAD TO FURTHER CONCRETE                            STEPS TO IMPROVE RELATIONS13 COMPLETING HIS REVIEW OF HIS VISIT SISCO SAID THAT THE SHAH HAD EXPRESSED CONCERN REGARDING                            SOVIET INTENTIONS IN THE REGION THE SHAH FELT IT COULD NOT IGNORE SUCH                            DEVELOPMENTS AS THE SOVIET TREATIES WITH IRAQ AND INDIA THE IRAQI ARMS                            INCIDENT IN PAKISTAN AND SOVIET ACTIVITIES IN SOUTH YEMEN THE INDIAN                            OCEAN AND THE IRAQI PORT OF UMM QASR THE SHAH HAD FURTHER SAID IRAN                            WOULD BE CONCERNED AT ANY MOVE TO DISMEMBER PAKISTAN SISCO OBSERVED THAT DURING HIS CALL ON                            INDIAN FOREIGN MINISTER SINGH THE DEPUTY SECRETARY HAD MENTIONED IRANS                            CONCERN WITH SOVIET INTENTIONS SINGH HAD COMMENTED                            THAT TO THE EXTENT THAT INDIAN POLICY WAS A SOURCE OF IRANIAN CONCERN                            HIS COUNTRY WOULD NEED TO TRY TO DISPEL IRANIAN APPREHENSIONS

HE HAD BEEN CAUTIOUSLY BUT EMPHATICALLY TELLING AFRICAN REPS THAT,  ALTHOUGH HIS MISSION HAD NOT ACHIEVED WHAT SC HAD ASKED FOR,  SAG HAD MOVED FURTHER THAN SOME WOULD HAVE EXPECTED.

END SUMMARY. \n1.  PURSUANT TO HIS "" MANDATE ,""  AMB HOVEYDA ( IRAN)  CALLED ON AMB SCALI MAY 9  AMB BENNETT AND POLCOUNS ALSO PRESENT.   HOVEYDA WAS METICULOUS IN DESCRIBING HIMSELF AS REPRESENTATIVE OF IRAN CALLING UNOFFICIALLY ON "" EXPLORATORY NON- MISSION""  AS REPRESENTATIVE OF 31  MEMBERS OF WDC STUDY GROUP THAT HAD BEEN NAMED BY TREPCZYNSKI.  HE SAID MEMBERS  CONFIDENTIAL      HAD FOLLOWED HIS FORMULA AND INDIVIDUALLY REQUESTED HIM TO ACT. \n2.  BEFORE ASKING EXPECTED QUESTIONS ON BEHALF OF "" THE THIRTY- ONE,""  HOVEYDA SAID THAT HE HAD SUCCEEDED DESPITE SOV PRESSURE IN KEEPING THE TREPCZYNSKI- DESIGNATED GROUP FROM BECOMING FORMAL COMITE.  WHEN ASKED TO CHAIR GROUP,  HE HAD BEEN RELUCTANT TO ACCEPT AND HAD BEEN INSTRUCTED BY HIS GOVT TO ACT AS MODERATOR ( NOT CHAIRMAN)  OF INFORMAL GROUP ONLY IF REQUESTED BY ALL MEMBERS TO DO SO.  THIS CONDITION HAD GIVEN HIM NECESSARY LEVERAGE. \n3.  AFTER SIX MEETINGS,  GROUP HAD NOT REACHED CONSENSUS TO CONSTITUTE OFFICIAL COMITE.  NO BUREAU WOULD BE SELECTED.  THERE WAS NO CONSENSUS AS TO WHAT TO DO ABOUT PARTICIPATION OF NUCLEAR POWERS PERMANENTLY REPRESENTED ON SC;  MAJORITY OPPOSED PRESENT STRUCTURE BECAUSE OF ITS POLITICAL AND GEOGRAPHIC IMBALANCE. \n4.  CONSENSUS IN GROUP HAD BEEN REACHED ON SEVERAL POINTS:  ( A)  GROUP SHOULD NOT DISCUSS SUBSTANCE BUT SHOULD IDENTIFY OBSTACLES IN FORMATION OF OFFICIAL COMITE AND DECIDE HOW THESE OBSTACLES COULD BE HANDLED IN 28 TH GA,  ( B)  THERE SHOULD SOME DAY BE A WORLD DISARMAMENT CONFERENCE, ( C)  FOUR NON-  PARTICIPATING PERMANENT REPRESENTATIVES SHOULD BE APPROACHED BY HOVEYDA. \n5.  HOVEYDA REPORTED THAT ALL PARTICIPANTS HAD STRESSED IMPORTANCE OF CAREFUL PREPARATION OF ANY DISARMAMENT CONFER-  ENCE.  EVEN SOVS,  WHO HAD MENTIONED SIX OR SEVEN YEARS HENCE AS  LIKELY TIME FOR WDC,  HAD AGREED THAT EVEN OFFICIAL PREPARATORY COMITE SHOULD PROCEED VERY CAREFULLY. \n6.  HOVEYDA THEN FORMALLY ASKED QUESTIONS FORESEEN PARA 2  REFTEL.  SCALI RESPONDED PER INSTRUCTIONS,  MAKING PERSONAL PREDICTION US UNLIKELY TO FIND IT COULD COOPERATE IF SPECIAL COMITE FORMED. \n7.  BUSINESS CONCLUDED,  HOVEYDA GAVE OFF- RECORD PERSONAL OPINION THAT AMONG UN MEMBERSHIP THERE IS GENERAL INCLINATION IN FAVOR OF EVENTUAL WDC.  HOWEVER,  MAJORITY WANT TO AVOID  CONFIDENTIAL      HAVING SUCH CONF BECOME INSTRUMENT OF ONE POWER OR ANOTHER .  THEY WANT CONF THAT WOULD HAVE PRACTICAL RESULT.  ALREADY,  HOVEYDA THOUGHT,  WDC ITEM IS ESCAPING SOV CONTROL. \n8.  SCALI EXPRESSED GRATITUDE FOR HOVEYDA S PERSONAL OBSERVATIONS,  COMPLIMENTED HIM FOR SKILL WITH WHICH HE HAD BEEN HANDLING HIMSELF AS MODERATOR OF WDC GROUP,  AND INDICATED THAT HOVEYDA S TALENTS WOULD UNDOUBTEDLY BE CHALLENGED FURTHER BY SOV TACTICS.  SCALI SAID HE COULD WELL UNDERSTAND THAT GENUINE YEARNING EXISTED AMONG MEDIUM AND SMALL POWERS FOR WDC.  HOWEVER,  HE PERSONALLY DOUBTED THAT WDC COULD BE EFFECTIVE INSTRUMENT FOR DEALING WITH DISARMAMENT QUESTIONS,  EVEN IF UN COMMUNITY EVENTUALLY HAD OPPORTUNITY TO ELIMINATE SOV PROPAGANDA FACTOR AND APPROACH PROBLEM ON REALISTIC BASIS.  SCALI EXPRESSED VIEW THAT GLOBAL DISARMAMENT ISSUES SO COMPLEX AND TECHNICAL THAT IT DIFFICULT FOR HIM TO CONCEIVE THAT UN MEMBERS LACKING DIRECT EXPERIENCE OF THESE COMPLEXITIES COULD DEAL WITH THEM EFFECTIVELY. \n9.  OUT CONSULTATIONS WITH BRITISH AND FRENCH AFTERNOON MAY 8  INDICATED THAT BOTH MISSIONS WILL TELL HOVEYDA MAY 10 ( A)  THEY WILL NOT PARTICIPATE IN WDC COMITE UNLESS ALL NUCLEAR POWERS AGREE TO PARTICIPATE AND ( B)  THEY WILL SEEK INSTRUCTIONS REGARDING COOPERATION WITH COMITE.  WE SUGGESTED US,  UK AND FRENCH RESPONSES TO HOVEYDA S DEMARCHE BE DELAYED UNTIL AFTER HIS DEPARTURE FROM NEW YORK;  UK AND FRANCE READILY AGREED,  NOTING THAT WEO S NAMED TO WDC COMITE HAD URGED THIS TACTIC TO STRENGTHEN THEIR HAND VIS- A- VIS SOVS.  ( WEO S FEEL THIS DELAYING MANEUVER WILL ENSURE THAT COMITE TAKES NO FORMAL ACTION UNTIL 28 TH GA.) \n0.  COMMENT:  RECOMMEND OUR RESPONSE TO HOVEYDA S DEMARCHE BE CONVEYED ORALLY TO IRANIAN UN MISSION FOLLOWING HOVEYDA S DEPARTURE FROM NEW YORK IN MID - JUNE.   SCALI\n",1044461

YUGOSLAV PERM REP MOJSOV AT HIS REQUEST CALLED ON AMB.  SCALI MAY 24.  MOJSOV REPORTED THAT HE HAD MET WITH HIS FONMIN FEW DAYS AGO IN LIMA,  PERU AND HAD ATTENDED CONFERENCE OF YUGOSLAV LA AMBASSADORS.  AT THIS MEETING HE HAD BEEN FULLY BRIEFED BY HIS FONMIN IN LATEST YUGOSLAV CONTACTS WITH EGYPT.  MOJSOV STATED THAT PRESIDENT TITO WAS IN CONTINUOUS CONTACT WITH HEADS OF ARAB GOVERNMENTS AND,  AS WE KNEW,  SADAT HAD VISITED YUGOSLAVIA FEW MONTHS AGO TO CONVEY HIS GREAT CONCERN TO TITO OVER ME SITUATION.  THIS VISIT AND CONTACTS SINCE THEN WITH EGYPTIANS HAD GIVEN GOY GENERAL IMPRESSION SITUATION IN ME,  ESPECIALLY IN EGYPT,  "" IS APPROACHING POINT OF GREAT COMPLICATION""  IF SOMETHING IS NOT DONE TO GIVE APPEARANCE SEARCH FOR PEACE IS CONTINUING.  SITUATION OF NO WAR,  NO PEACE IS "" UNBEARABLE""  FOR EGYPT AND EGYPTIAN LEADERS COULD TAKE DESPERATE DECISION IF NOTHING DONE. \n2.  YUGOSLAV LEADERS HAVE FOUND THAT EGYPT IS MUCH MORE FLEXIBLE CONCERNING EVENTUAL PEACE SETTLEMENT THAN HAD BEEN ANTICIPATED.  EGYPTIANS,  HE SAID,  WANT "" REAL PEACE""  AND RECOGNIZE ISRAEL S NEED FOR SECURE AND RECOGNIZED BOUNDARIES.  ALSO,  EGYPTIANS APPEAR PREPARED FOR VARIOUS ARRANGEMENTS IN SINAI,  SUCH AS LARGE DEMILITARIZED ZONES AND POSSIBLY EVEN AN ISRAELI ROLE AT SHARM- EL- SHEIKH. \n3.  MOJSOV STATED THAT,  WHEN HE SAW FONMIN ZAYYAT DURING APRIL SC MEETING,  LATTER HAD EMPHASIZED EGYPT WAS NOT ASKING FOR JUST ANOTHER DEBATE.  EGYPT WANTED TO MAKE "" FINAL ATTEMPT""  TO FIND ROAD TO PEACEFUL SOLUTION.  ZAYYAT,  OF COURSE,  DID NOT EXPECT IMMEDIATE RESULTS,  BUT DESIRED TO PROBE TO SEE WHAT ARE "" REMAINING POSSIBILITIES"".  HE HAD SAID PRESENT SITUATION CANNOT LAST;  SC MUST HELP IN "" THIS SEARCH FOR HOPE.""  LATER IN CONVERSATION MOJSOV REFERRED BACK TO HIS MEETING WITH ZAYYAT AND REPORTED ZAYYAT HAD SAID,  IF EGYPT FAILS TO GET ANYTHING FROM SC,  IT WOULD BE IN BETTER POSITION UNDERTAKE NEW  CONFIDENTIAL      WAR.  EGYPT WOULD BE DEFEATED,  ZAYYAT ADMITTED,  BUT AT LEAST NEW SITUATION WOULD BE CREATED.  YUGOSLAVS HAVE CONCLUDED,  MOJSOV SAID,  THAT,  IF SC FAILS TO FIND "" NEW HOPE"",  SITUATION IN ME WILL DETERIORATE RAPIDLY AND EXTREMISM WILL BE INCREASED,  INCLUDING ACTS OF TERRORISM. \n4.  SCALI SAID THAT WE SHARE IN PART YUGOSLAV VIEW TENSION IN AREA IS INCREASING;  SITUATION IS NOT A HAPPY ONE.  WITHIN SC CONTEXT MUCH DEPENDS,  HE STATED,  ON APPROACH,  ATTITUDE,  AND OBJECTIVES OF EGYPT-- WHICH WAS PARTY LOW- KEY AND REASONABLE DEBATE WHICH DOES NOT ADD TO TENSIONS.  WE AGREE SC MUST HOLD OUT SOME HOPE;  CONTINUING DEADLOCK WILL INCREASE TENSIONS.  SCALI COMMENTED THAT WE WERE VERY ENCOURAGED BY MOJSOV S COMMENT THAT EGYPT IS CONCILIATORY AND APPARENTLY PREPARED FOR SERIOUS CONCESSIONS.  US BELIEVES,  HE CONTINUED,  THAT BOTH SIDES HAVE TO MAKE ADDITIONAL CONCESSIONS AND OUR APPROACH WILL BE TO ENCOURAGE THEM TO DO SO.  AT PRESENT US UNABLE MAKE SPECIFIC PROPOSALS CONCERNING SC DEBATE UNTIL WE HEAR WHAT EGYPTIANS WANT.  YUGOSLAVIA IN THIS SITUATION HAS UNIQUE OPPORTUNITY PLAY CALMING AND CONSTRUCTIVE ROLE TO KEEP ARABS FROM EXTREMIST POSITIONS. \n5.  SCALI EXPRESSED HOPE THAT EGYPT AND OTHERS WILL NOT WISH ALTER BALANCE OF RES 242  SINCE IT IS ONLY BASIS FOR PEACEFUL SOLUTION SUPPORTED BY BOTH SIDES.  US WOULD STRONG OPPOSE ANY SUCH INITIATIVE.  IF EFFORT IS MADE REDRAFT RES,  OR REINTERPRET IT,  OR ADOPT PUNITIVE MEASURES,  ME SITUATION WILL BE SET BACK.  SCALI STRESSED THAT IT WOULD BE SERIOUS ERROR FOR ARABS AND OTHERS TO CONCLUDE THAT US HAS DOWNGRADED ITS BELIEF THAT ME IS HIGHLY VOLATILE AREA,  WHICH HAS HIGHEST PRIORITY  WITHIN USG.  "" YEAR OF EUROPE""  DEFINITELY DOES NOT MEAN ANY CHANGE IN PRIORITY GIVEN TO ME BY HIGH US OFFICIALS. \n6.  MOJSOV REPLIED THAT HIS GOVERNMENT WAS AWARE OF THIS VIEW.  DURING RECENT BRANDT- TITO TALKS,  TITO HAD ASKED BRANDT TO TRANSMIT HIS GREAT CONCERN OVER ME TO PRESIDENT NIXON DURING BRANDT- NIXON TALKS AND TO ASCERTAIN WHETHER PRES INTENDED CONTINUE EFFORTS FOR PEACEFUL SETTLEMENT.  FOLLOWING BRANDT S RETURN TO GERMANY,  HE HAD SENT LETTER TO TITO STATING THAT HE WAS VERY SATISFIED WITH HIS TALKS WITH PRES NIXON FOR HE HAD RECEIVED ASSURANCE US NOT SATISFIED WITH PRESENT ME SITUATION,  IT IS VERY CONCERNED AND IT READY TO CONTRIBUTE  CONFIDENTIAL      TO SEARCH FOR PEACE.  TITO HAD TRANSMITTED TO SADAT THESE INDICATIONS OF CONTINUING US INTEREST.  SCALI\n7.  TITO,  MOJSOV CONTINUED,  HAS "" BEEN GIVING MUCH THOUGHT TO WHAT MIGHT BE DONE TO LESSEN TENSIONS AND GET DIPLOMATIC PROCESS UNDERWAY.""  HE HAD CONCLUDED THAT FOUR POWERS COULD STILL PLAY SIGNIFICANT ROLE.  TITO WAS THINKING NOT OF RESUMPTION OF OLD FOUR- POWER FORUM,  WHICH HAD FAR TOO OFTEN BEEN USED FOR POLITICAL AND PROPAGANDA ADVANTAGES,  BUT RATHER A SPECIAL EFFORT BY FOUR TO PLAY MEDIATORY OR GOOD OFFICER ROLE.  FOUR POWERS COULD,  TITO THOUGHT,  LIST POINTS OF AGREEMENT BETWEEN ME PARTIES AS WELL AS POINTS OF DISAGREEMENT AND THEN USE THEIR RESPECTIVE INFLUENCE TO DECREASE POINTS OF DIFFERENCE.   TITO HAD MADE THIS SUGGESTION TO SADAT WHO,  ALTHOUGH SKEPTICAL,  GAVE GREEN LIGHT. \n8.  MOJSOV SAID THAT MUCH OF UN TALK REVOLVED AROUND VARIETY OF NEW MECHANISMS.  YUGOSLAVIA DID NOT BELIEVE JARRING COULD BE REACTIVATED ON OLD LINES.  CAREFUL EXAMINATION OF  CONFIDENTIAL      OTHER IDEAS FOR NEW MECHANISMS REVEALED SERIOUS DEFICIENCIES.  YET,  CLEARLY,  SOMETHING HAD TO BE DONE IN VIEW OF PRESENT DANGEROUS ME SITUATION.  YUGOSLAVIA AGREED RES 242  SHOULD NOT BE UNDERMINED;  NOTHING BETTER COULD BE DRAFTED AND YUGOSLAVIA HAD PASSED THIS VIEW TO EGYPT. \n9.  LOOKING AHEAD TO DEBATE,  MOJSOV NOTED THERE ARE  TWO ASPECTS TO SC CONSIDERATION:  A)  PUBLIC DEBATE WHICH IS OFTEN MEANT FOR HOME- CONSUMPTION;  B)  BEHIND THE SCENES NEGOTIATIONS.  YUGOSLAVIA WILL NOT BE DISTURBED IF PUBLIC RHETORIC IS AT HIGH LEVEL FOR THAT IS NATURAL,  BUT BELIEVES EGYPT WILL BE FLEXIBLE IN REAL NEGOTIATIONS BEHIND SCENES.  SCALI REPLIED THAT US "" FAILS TO BE EXCITED""  BY NEW MECHANISMS FOR EACH HAS,  AS MOJSOV STATED,  SERIOUS DEFICIENCIES.  US ALSO HELD STRONG VIEW THAT REVIVAL OF FOUR- POWER FORUM WOULD NOT BE HELPFUL.  FOUR POWERS,  SCALI SAID,  COULD NOT IMPOSE SETTLEMENT AND WERE FACED WITH SAME DIFFICULTIES WHICH JARRING OR ANY OTHER MECHANISM CONFRONTED.  DIFFERENCES BETWEEN PARTIES ARE SO WIDE THAT US HAD TO BE STRONGLY SKEPTICAL THAT ANY UN MECHANISM CAN GIVE "" HOPEFUL THRUST""  TO SEARCH FOR PEACE.  US CONTINUES BELIEVE INTERIM ARRANGEMENT REPRESENTS BEST HOPE OF UNFREEZING PRESENT DEADLOCK. \n0.  SCALI REITERATED POINT THAT CONCESSIONS BY BOTH SIDES WILL PROVE NECESSARY.  HE NOTED THAT PRES NIXON AND BREZHNEV WILL UNDOUBTEDLY DISCUSS ME AT SUMMIT MEETING IN JUNE.  HE BELIEVED THAT IT WOULD BE MOST USEFUL TO AVOID HEATING UP ME SITUATION  PRIOR TO NIXON- BREZHNEV DISCUSSIONS WHICH SHOULD BE HELD IN AS HARMONIOUS AND ATMOSPHERE AS POSSIBLE.
