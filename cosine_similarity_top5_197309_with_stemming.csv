reftels the DAO and other elements of the Embassy have                            worked urgently to put together the requested presentations for FY 75 ref A and for FY 7579 ref B The FY 75                            material for the Department is contained in ref C The main elements of                                DAOs 5year projection are now                            scheduled to reach CINCPAC Sept                            72 We have addressed this question as requested but as our work                            progressed it became increasingly clear to me that in the existing and                            foreseeable conditions achievement of the US objectives in VietNam would simply be impossible if we                            were either confined by the dollar guidelines given in ref B or by the                            constraints of a conversion to MAP from                                MASF The structure of MAP was not intended for the situation in                            VietNam To try to cope with this major concern of American policy                            within the OMB dollar ceilings and the                            inevitable and inescapable restrictions of MAP procedures is folly of such proportion that it verges                            on stupidity and I simply will not participate in a process which will                            lead us down the primrose path of selfdeception until it may be too                            late to do what must be done3 I have therefore instructed the staff to project MAP requirements on the basis of what is                            needed without reference to the dollar guidelines The resulting                            figures among other things emphasize the absolute necessity of keeping                                MASF at least for the next two                            years The crucial importance of this to the completion of our national                            objectives in VietNam and the critical next two years merits the                            consideration and judgment of highest levels of this government We                            simply must make a major effort to keep our assistance to VietNam under                            flexible and promptreaction procedures of MASF I consider this quite within the realm of the

said that although he has been a strong opponent of continuing our military assistance                            and military sales programs he will vote for military assistance for                            VietNam and Cambodia4 These are some of the reasons for keeping MASF:A MAP was not intended and is totally                            impractical for a country engaged in sustained hostilities and under                            threat of a renewed major aggression as VietNam currently is The                            cumbersome programming and funding procedures of MAP preclude timely resupply even on the limited                            oneforone basis contemplated by the Paris AgreementB MASF screens and lowers the                            visibility of our continuing military assistance to VietNam thereby                            making it more difficult for the North Vietnamese and others to engage                            in their routine distortions in relation to Article 7 of the ceasefire                            The more open procedures of MAP give a                            continuing greater exposure of our ongoing assistance programs and the                            necessary Congressional testimony and debate would give the Hanoi                            propagandists a field dayC Headquarters costs PCHT and

uniformed personnel who have staffed the                                MAAGs These could not be brought                            to VietNam in significant numbers because of the limitation on DAO uniformed personnel in relation to                            ceasefire2 It is questionable whether a staff adequate for administration of the                            worlds largest MAP could be                            accommodated at all under our DAO                            personnel ceilings JUSMAG Korea for                            example with a program equal to perhaps 25 per cent of the program                            contemplated for VietNam consists of over 400 authorized spacesE A large VietNam MAP would be                            continuously vulnerable to raiding by MAP administrators to meet shortages in other country                            programsF Additions to a requirement of some 134 billion for VietNam to the                            current request of some 650 million for all other countries creates                            such an obvious distortion that it would encourage disproportionate                            Congressional cuts which Vietnam would have to share with others to the                            loss of all This would be true even if VietNam MAP were as some have proposed a separate line item in                            the MAP legislationG And perhaps most importantly the transfer of VietNam military aid                            from MASF to MAP would signal to the enemy a lessened US commitment to give full support to the                                GVN and could encourage the North                            Vietnamese to mount another major offensive action or try to raise the                            level of subversive violence within South VietNam5 Over the years notably in the offensive of 1972 the enemy has taken                            crippling losses Despite his continuing belligerent position he has a                            number of weaknesses and vulnerabilities At the same time the GVN is slowly consolidating its political                            position and has shown itself militarily able to handle the North                            Vietnamese when it has the necessary equipment and other defense                            resources US objectives in VietNam are                            well on the way to achievement Therefore I simply will not accept the                            fact that something so vital to the final consolidation of that                            achievement can be so lightly thrown away simply because we do not make                            the effort we are capable of making on the Hill No one department can do it alone but a concerted                            wellplanned wellcoordinated effort by the White House State and                            Defense can certainly get MASF for                            VietNam extended to the end of FY                            19756 But it wont get done if we keep wringing our hands and telling each                            other how difficult it is and we must prepare for a fall back to MAP as a contingency If one really senior                            level person who knows the Hill                            is given a clear direction that it is MASF not MAP for VietNam                            and is given the capable assistance of one thousandth of the man hours                            we have already wasted in this exercise there will be no doubt of the                            outcome7 I make no apology for the bluntness of this message Its time we                            adjourned The Childrens Hour and got back to serious business My                            assignment from the President was to keep this country afloat viable                            and increasingly capable of standing on its own feet I take the                            Presidents instructions seriously It can be done I intend to do it                            And I must have MASF at least through                                FY 1975 If the rest of the                            Washington bureaucracy takes the Presidents instruction as seriously as                            we do here we will get itMartin,frus1969-76v10d105,"1. IN RESPONSE TO REFTELS, THE DAO AND OTHER ELEMENTS OF THE EMBASSY HAVE WORKED URGENTLY TO PUT TOGETHER THE REQUESTED PRESENTATIONS FOR FY 75 (REF A) AND FOR FY 75-79 (REF B). THE FY 75 MATERIAL FOR THE DEPARTMENT IS CONTAINED IN REF C. THE MAIN ELEMENTS OF DAOS 5-YEAR PROJECTION ARE NOW SCHEDULED TO REACH CINCPAC SEPT 7.\n2. WE HAVE ADDRESSED THIS QUESTION AS REQUESTED BUT AS OUR WORK PROGRESSED, IT BECAME INCREASINGLY CLEAR TO ME THAT IN THE EXISTING AND FORESEEABLE CONDITIONS, ACHIEVEMENT OF THE US OBJECTIVES IN VIET-NAM WOULD SIMPLY BE IMPOSSIBLE IF WE WERE EITHER CONFINED BY THE DOLLAR GUIDELINES GIVEN IN REF B OR BY THE CONSTRAINTS OF A CONVERSION TO MAP FROM MASF. THE STRUCTURE OF MAP WAS NOT INTENDED FOR THE SITUATION IN VIET-NAM. TO TRY TO COPE WITH THIS MAJOR CONCERN OF AMERICAN POLICY WITHIN THE OMB DOLLAR CEILINGS AND THE INEVITABLE AND INESCAPABLE RESTRICTIONS OF MAP PROCEDURES, IS FOLLY OF SUCH PROPORTION THAT IT VERGES ON STUPIDITY AND I SIMPLY WILL NOT PARTICIPATE IN A PROCESS WHICH WILL LEAD US DOWN THE PRIMROSE PATH OF SELF-DECEPTION UNTIL IT MAY    SECRET  BE TOO LATE TO DO WHAT MUST BE DONE.\n3. I HAVE, THEREFORE, INSTRUCTED THE STAFF TO PROJECT MAP REQUIREMENTS ON THE BASIS OF WHAT IS NEEDED WITHOUT REFERENCE TO THE DOLLAR GUIDELINES. THE RESULTING FIGURES, AMONG OTHER THINGS, EMPHASIZE THE ABSOLUTE NECESSITY OF KEEPING MASF, AT LEAST FOR THE NEXT TWO YEARS. THE CRUCIAL IMPORTANCE OF THIS TO THE COMPLETION OF OUR NATIONAL OBJECTIVES IN VIET-NAM, AND THE  CRITICAL NEXT TWO YEARS, MERITS THE CONSIDERATION ANDJUDGMENT OF HIGHEST LEVELS OF THIS GOVERNMENT. WE SIMPLY MUST MAKE A MAJOR EFFORT TO KEEP OUR ASSISTANCE TO VIET-NAM UNDER FLEXIBLE AND PROMPT-REACTION PROCEDURES OF MASF. I CONSIDER THIS QUITE WITHIN THE REALM OF THE POSSIBLE, BUT WE HAVE TO SERIOUSLY START TO WORK ON IT-- NOW. THERE ARE WELL-DISPOSED ELEMENTS IN CONGRESS BUT WE CANT GET THEIR VOTES BY NOT ASKING FOR THEM OR ASKING TWO HOURS BEFORE THE VOET IS TAKEN. EVEN REPRESENTATIVE CLARENCE LONG OF MARYLAND RECENTLY IN BOTH SAIGON AND PHNOM PENH SAID THAT ALTHOUGH HE HAS BEEN A STRONG OPPONENT OF CONTINUING OUR MILITARY ASSISTANCE AND MILITARY SALES PROGRAMS, HE WILL VOTE FOR MILITARY ASSISTANCE FOR VIET-NAM AND CAMBODIA.\n4.THESE ARE SOME OF THE REASONS FOR KEEPING MASF:\n1.34 BILLION FOR VIET-NAM TO THE CURRENT REQUEST OF SOME $650 MILLION FOR ALL OTHER COUNTRIES CREATES SUCH AN OBVIOUS DISTORTION THAT IT WOULD ENCOURAGE DISPROPORTIONATE CONGRESSIONAL CUTS WHICH VIETNAM WOULD HAVE TO SHARE WITH OTHERS TO THE LOSS OF ALL. THIS WOULD BE TRUE EVEN IF VIET-NAM MAP WERE, AS SOME HAVE PROPOSED, A SEPARATE LINE ITEM IN THE MAP LEGISLATION.\n5. OVER THE YEARS, NOTABLY IN THE OFFENSIVE OF 1972, THE ENEMY HAS TAKEN CRIPPLING LOSSES. DESPITE HIS CONTINUING BELLIGERENT POSITION HE HAS A NUMBER OF WEAKNESSES AND VULNERABILITIES. AT THE SAME TIME, THE GVN IS SLOWLY CONSOLIDATING ITS POLITICAL POSITION AND HAS SHOWN ITSELF MILITARILY ABLE TO HANDLE THE NORTH VIETNAMESE    SECRET  WHEN IT HAS THE NECESSARY EQUIPMENT AND OTHER DEFENSE RESOURCES. US OBJECTIVES IN VIET-NAM ARE WELL ON THE WAY TO ACHIEVEMENT. THEREFORE, I SIMPLY WILL NOT ACCEPT THE FACT THAT SOMETHING SO VITAL TO THE FINAL CONSOLIDATION OF THAT ACHIEVEMENT CAN BE SO LIGHTLY THROWN AWAY SIMPLY BECAUSE WE DO NOT MAKE THE EFFORT WE ARE CAPABLE OF MAKING ON THE HILL.NO ONE DEPARTMENT CAN DO IT ALONE, BUT A CONCERTED WELL-PLANNED, WELL-COORDINATED EFFORT BY THE WHITE HOUSE, STATE AND DEFENSE CAN CERTAINLY GET MASF FOR VIET-NAM EXTENDED TO THE END OF FY 1975.\n6. BUT IT WONT GET DONE IF WE KEEP WRINGING OUR HANDS AND TELLING EACH OTHER HOW DIFFICULT IT IS AND WE MUST PREPARE FOR A FALL BACK TO MAP AS A CONTINGENCY. IF ONE REALLY SENIOR LEVEL PERSON WHO KNOWS THE HILL IS GIVEN A CLEAR DIRECTION THAT IT IS MASF NOT MAP FOR VIET-NAM AND IS GIVEN THE CAPABLE ASSISTANCE OF ONE THOUSANDTH OF THE MAN HOURS WE HAVE ALREADY WASTED IN THIS EXERCISE, THERE WILL BE NO DOUBT OF THE OUTCOME.\n7. I MAKE NO APOLOGY FOR THE BLUNTNESS OF THIS MESSAGE. ITS TIME WE ADJOURNED ""THE CHILDRENS HOUR"" AND GOT BACK TO SERIOUS BUSINESS. MY ASSIGNMENT FROM THE PRESIDENT WAS TO KEEP THIS COUNTRY AFLOAT, VIABLE, AND INCREASINGLY CAPABLE OF STANDING ON ITS OWN FEET. I TAKE THE PRESIDENTS INSTRUCTIONS SERIOUSLY. IT CAN BE DONE. I INTEND TO DO IT. AND I MUST HAVE MASF AT LEAST THROUGH FY 1975. IF THE REST OF THE WASHINGTON BUREAUCRACY TAKES THE PRESIDENTS INSTRUCTION AS SERIOUSLY AS WE DO HERE, WE WILL GET IT.

    level of subversive violence within South VietNam5 Over the years notably in the offensive of 1972 the enemy has taken                            crippling losses Despite his continuing belligerent position he has a                            number of weaknesses and vulnerabilities At the same time the GVN is slowly consolidating its political                            position and has shown itself militarily able to handle the North                            Vietnamese when it has the necessary equipment and other defense                            resources US objectives in VietNam are                            well on the way to achievement Therefore I simply will not accept the                            fact that something so vital to the final consolidation of that                            achievement can be so lightly thrown away simply because we do not make                            the effort we are capable of making on the Hill No one department can do it

                material for the Department is contained in ref C The main elements of                                DAOs 5year projection are now                            scheduled to reach CINCPAC Sept                            72 We have addressed this question as requested but as our work                            progressed it became increasingly clear to me that in the existing and                            foreseeable conditions achievement of the US objectives in VietNam would simply be impossible if we                            were either confined by the dollar guidelines given in ref B or by the                            constraints of a conversion to MAP from                                MASF The structure of MAP was not intended for the situation in                            VietNam To try to cope with this major concern of American policy                            within the OMB dollar ceilings and the                            inevitable and inescapable restrictions of MAP procedures is folly of such proportion that it verges                            on stupidity and I simply will not participate in a process which will                            lead us down the primrose path of selfdeception until it may be too                            late to do what must be done3 I have therefore instructed the staff to project MAP requirements on the basis of what is                            needed without reference to the dollar guidelines The resulting                            figures among other things emphasize the absolute necessity of keeping                                MASF at least for the next two                            years The crucial importance of this to the completion of our national                            objectives in VietNam and the critical next two years merits the                            consideration and judgment of highest levels of this government We                            simply must make a major effort to keep our assistance to VietNam under                            flexible and promptreaction procedures of MASF I consider this quite within the realm of the                            possible but we have to seriously start to work on itnow There are                            welldisposed elements in Congress but we cant get their votes by not                            asking for them or asking two hours before the vote is taken Even                            Representative Clarence Long of Maryland recently in both Saigon and                            Phnom Penh said that although he has been a strong opponent of continuing our military assistance                            and military sales programs he will vote for military assistance for                            VietNam and Cambodia4 These are some of the reasons for keeping MASF:A MAP was not intended and is totally                            impractical for a country engaged in sustained hostilities and under                            threat of a renewed major aggression as VietNam currently is The                            cumbersome programming and funding procedures of MAP preclude timely resupply even on the limited                            oneforone basis contemplated by the Paris AgreementB MASF screens and lowers the                            visibility of our continuing military assistance to VietNam thereby                            making it more difficult for the North Vietnamese and others to engage                            in their routine distortions in relation to Article 7 of the ceasefire                            The more open procedures of MAP give a                            continuing greater exposure of our ongoing assistance programs and the                            necessary Congressional testimony and debate would give the Hanoi                            propagandists a field dayC Headquarters costs PCHT and                            training covered by the DOD budget in                            the case of MASF must be met by MAP funds thus diminishing worldwide                            amounts available for investment and OMD MAP for VietNam would create two                            major personnel problems:1 The skills for MAP administration are                            found almost exclusively in uniformed personnel who have staffed the                                MAAGs These could not be brought                            to VietNam in significant numbers because of the limitation on DAO uniformed personnel in relation to                            ceasefire2 It is questionable whether a staff adequate for administration of the                            worlds largest MAP could be                            accommodated at all under our DAO                            personnel ceilings JUSMAG Korea for                            example with a program equal to perhaps 25 per cent of the program                            contemplated for VietNam consists of over 400 authorized spacesE A large VietNam MAP would be                            continuously vulnerable to raiding by MAP administrators to meet shortages in other country                            programsF Additions to a requirement of some 134 billion for VietNam to the                            current request of some 650 million for all other countries creates                            such an obvious distortion that it would encourage disproportionate                            Congressional cuts which Vietnam would have to share with others to the                            loss of all This would be true even if VietNam MAP were as some have proposed a separate line item in

IN THE REVIEW WE HAVE MADE IN RESPONSE TO REFS A AND C, MY FINDING IS THAT $1.3415 BILLION WOULD BE NECESSARY FOR MILITARY ASSISTANCE TO VIET-NAM FOR FY-75, INCLUDING TRAIN- ING, PCH&amp;T AND THE OVERHEAD OF ADMINISTERING THE MAP. AL- THOUGH TRAINING, PCH&amp;T AND THE OVERHEAD COSTS OF ADMINISTERING THE MAP ARE NOT INCLUDED IN THE PROGRAM FOR THE REPUBLIC OF VIET-NAM, IT SHOULD BE POINTED OUT THAT THESE COSTS WOULD ADD A LARGE SUM, $150 MILLION, TO THE TOTAL WORLD-WIDE MAP REQUEST. THE FIGURE IS THE SAME AS THAT IDENTIFIED FOR FY-75 IN THE FIVE- YEAR 1975-79 PROJECTION BEING FORWARDED SHORTLY BY DAO IN RESPONSE TO REF C. THE FY-75 PROJECTION ACCEPTS THE ASSUMPTION SET FORTH BY SECDEF IN REF C OF A 1.1 MILLION FORCE LEVEL WITH A 66 SQUADRON AIR FORCE, AND COMBAT ACTIVITY AT THE LEVEL OF APRIL-MAY 1973.

JUSTIFICATION AND BREAKDOWN. THE MAIN JUSTIFICATION FOR THE PROPOSED PROGRAM IS THE MASSIVE INVESTMENT THE UNITED STATES HAS ALREADY MADE TO ACHIEVE ITS OBJECTIVES IN VIET-NAM COMBINED WITH THE GROWING STRENGTH OF THE RVN IN CONSOLIDATING ITS POLITICAL AND MILITARY STRENGTH, AND THE IMPORTANCE OF PROVIDING WITHIN THE LIMITS OF THE CEASE-FIRE AGREEMENT THE DEFENSE RESOURCES WHICH WILL INSURE THE RVN CAPABILITY TO PREVENT THE NORTH FROM CONQUERING IT BY FORCE. THE FIVE-YEAR PROJECTION TO BE FORWARDED SHORTLY BY DAO TO CINCPAC AND DOD WILL OUTLINE THE FY-75 PROPOSALS IN DETAIL.

THE REQUIRED REPLACEMENTS ARE MAINLY (A) AIRCRAFT LOST BOTH IN OPERATIONS AND BECAUSE OF AGE OR OBSOLESCENCE; (B) PATROL GUNBOATS REPLACED BECAUSE OF AGE; (C) ARMORED AND REGULAR SUPPORT VEHICLES (APCS, TRUCKS, ETC.); (D) TANKS AND WEAPONS (HAND, CREW-SERVED INFANTRY, AND ARTILLERY) LOST BOTH OPERATIONALLY AND BE- CAUSE OF AGE AND OBSOLESCENCE; AND (E) OTHER SUPPORT EQUIPMENT (ENGINEERING, SIGNAL, MEDICAL, ETC.). $47.7 MILLION IS REQUIRED FOR 216 M-48 TANKS TO REPLACE EXISTING M-41S AS WELL AS 12 M-48S TO COVER PROJECTED LOSES. THE M-41S ARE NOT COMPARABLE TO THE SOVIET T-54 TANKS HELD BY THE NORTH VIETNAMESE IN SOUTH VIET-NAM.

          lead us down the primrose path of selfdeception until it may be too                            late to do what must be done3 I have therefore instructed the staff to project MAP requirements on the basis of what is                            needed without reference to the dollar guidelines The resulting                            figures among other things emphasize the absolute

       objectives in VietNam and the critical next two years merits the                            consideration and judgment of highest levels of this government We                            simply must make a major effort to keep our assistance to VietNam under                            flexible and promptreaction procedures of MASF I consider this quite within the realm of the

         VietNam and Cambodia4 These are some of the reasons for keeping MASF:A MAP was not intended and is totally                            impractical for a country engaged in sustained hostilities and under                            threat of a renewed major aggression as VietNam currently is The                            cumbersome programming and funding procedures of MAP preclude timely resupply even on the limited                            oneforone basis contemplated by the Paris AgreementB MASF screens and lowers the                            visibility of our continuing military assistance to VietNam thereby                            making it more difficult for the North Vietnamese and others to engage                            in their routine distortions in relation to Article 7 of the ceasefire                            The more open procedures of MAP give a                            continuing greater exposure of our ongoing assistance programs and the                            necessary Congressional testimony and debate would give the Hanoi                            propagandists a field dayC Headquarters costs PCHT and                            training covered by the DOD budget in                            the case of MASF must be met by MAP funds thus diminishing worldwide                            amounts available for investment and OMD MAP for VietNam would create two                            major personnel problems:1 The skills for MAP administration are                            found almost exclusively in uniformed personnel who have staffed the                                MAAGs These could not be brought                            to VietNam in significant numbers because of the limitation on DAO uniformed personnel in relation to                            ceasefire2 It is questionable whether a staff adequate for administration of the                            worlds largest MAP could be                            accommodated at all under our DAO                            personnel ceilings JUSMAG Korea for                            example with a program equal to perhaps 25 per cent of the program                            contemplated for VietNam consists of over 400 authorized spacesE A large VietNam MAP would be                            continuously vulnerable to raiding by MAP administrators to meet shortages in other country                            programsF Additions to a requirement of some 134 billion for VietNam to the                            current request of some 650 million for all other countries creates                            such an obvious distortion that it would encourage disproportionate                            Congressional cuts which Vietnam would have to share with others to the                            loss of all This would be true even if VietNam MAP were as some have proposed a separate line item in                            the MAP legislationG And perhaps most importantly the transfer of VietNam military aid                            from MASF to MAP would signal to the enemy a lessened US commitment to give full support to the                                GVN and could encourage the North                            Vietnamese to mount another major offensive action or try to raise the                            level of subversive violence within South VietNam5 Over the years notably in the offensive of 1972 the enemy has taken                            crippling losses Despite his continuing belligerent position he has a                            number of weaknesses and vulnerabilities At the same time the GVN is slowly consolidating its political                            position and has shown itself militarily able to handle the North                            Vietnamese when it has the necessary equipment and other defense                            resources US objectives in VietNam are                            well on the way to achievement Therefore I simply will not accept the                            fact that something so vital to the final consolidation of that                            achievement can be so lightly thrown away simply because we do not make                            the effort we are capable of making on the Hill No one department can do it alone but a concerted                            wellplanned wellcoordinated effort by the White House State and                            Defense can certainly get MASF for                            VietNam extended to the end of FY                            19756 But it wont get done if we keep wringing our hands and telling each                            other how difficult it is and we must prepare for a fall back to MAP as a contingency If one really senior                            level person who knows the Hill                            is given a clear direction that it is MASF not MAP for VietNam                            and is given the capable assistance of one thousandth of the man hours                            we have already wasted in this exercise there will be no doubt of the                            outcome7 I make no apology for the bluntness of this message Its time we                            adjourned The Childrens Hour and got back to serious

the rest of the                            Washington bureaucracy takes the Presidents instruction as seriously as                            we do here we will get itMartin,frus1969-76v10d105,"1.

(S) RTG AMBASSADOR TO US ANAND PANYARACHUN REQUESTED    SECRET\n3. (S) US FORCE REDUCTIONS. ANAND SAID THAT A RETURN TO THE TOTAL OF 32,000 US MILITARY PERSONNEL IN THAILAND WICH EXISTED PRIOR TO THE 1972 BUILDUP WAS DESIRABLE. ASKED IF HE WAS EXPRESSING A PERSONAL VIEW ANAND SAID THAT THIS WAS AN MFA POSITION WHICH HE THOUGHT CERTAIN THE RTG AS A WHOLE WOULD ACCEPT SOON.\n4.(S) ANAND CONTINUED THAT IF FURTHER REDUCTIONS BEYOND THE\n5.(S) ECONOMIC IMPACT. ANAND ADDED THAT THE ECONOMIC IMPACT OF THE WITHDRAWAL OF US FORCES HAS BEEN EXAGGERATED BY THOSE WHO SEEK TO JUSTIFY CONTINUANCE OF THE US PRESENCE AT A HIGH LEVEL. A RAPID REDUCTION COULD MAKE THE RTG FACE THE NECESSITY OF ECONOMIC REFORM. A LARGE MILITARY ASSISTANCE PRO- GRAM AND US PRESENCE CAN UNDERMINE THAI CONFIDENCE IN ABILITY TO SOLVE THEIR OWN PROBLEMS. THE ECONOMIC IMPACT OF US FORCES ""IS NOT ALWAYS POSITIVE."" ANAND ADDED:  ""WE CAN SURVIVE WITHOUT IT.""\n6. (S) B-52 WITHDRAWALS. THE AMBSSADOR NOTED THAT US FORCES WHICH ARE NOT COMMENSURATE WITH REQUIREMENTS CAN BE REDEPLOYED ANYTIME. HE ASKED SPECIFICALLY HOW MANY OF THE 50 B-52 AIRCRAFT IN THAILAND WILL BE WITHDRAWN. MR. DOOLIN RESPONDED THAT THE B-52 QUESTION IS STILL UNDER STUDY IN THE USG. ANAND COMMENTED THAT HE HOPED THAT ALL IN THE USG AGREE THAT SOME SHOULD BE WITHDRAWN.    SECRET\n7.(S) LONG-TERM PRESENCE. IN RESPONSE TO A QUESTION FROM MR. DOOLIN AS TO THE LONG-TERM LEVEL OF US FORCES, ANAND SAID THAT PERSONALLY HE THOUGHT A FEW THOUSANDS WOULD BE APPROPRIATE BUT THAT WE SHOULD SEE WHATIS FEASIBLE OVER THE NEXT TWO OR THREE YEARS. MR. DOOLIN COMMENTED THAT REENTRY RIGHTS WOULD GREATLY ASSIST OUR PLANNING. ANAND SAID THAT HE SAW NO PROBLEM ON THAT QUESTION.\n8. (S) MILITARY ASSISTANCE. ANAND SAID THAT THE RTG HOPED THAT THE LEVEL OF DOLS 60M CAN BE MAINTAINED AND THAT THE PRIME MINISTER MAY RAISE THE MATTER OF ASSISTANCE LEVELS DURING SECRETARY CLEMENTS VISIT TO BANGKOK 14 SEP. MR. DOOLIN REPLIED THAT THE REAL TEST IS ON CAPITOL HILL. ANAND SAID THAT HE HAD TRIED TO EXPLAIN THE CONGRESSIONAL MOOD TO THE PRIME MINISTER AND THE DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER BUT HE WAS NOT SURE THAT THEY APPRECIATED THE DIFFICULTIES.\n9. (S) MR. DOOLIN SAID THAT, FOR EXAMPLE, THE CONTINUING RESOLUTION AUTHORITY (CRA) GIVES ONLY DOLS 36M WORLDWIDE FOR THE SECOND QUARTER FY 74. AT THE RATE THE CAM- BODIAN ARMED FORCES ARE EXPENDING AMMO, THERE MAY BE LITTLE OR NOTHING LEFT FOR OTHER COUNTRIES. THE PIPELINE CONTINUES FROM PREVIOUS YEARS BUT THIS YEAR LOOKS BAD. ANAND ASKED HOW MANY COUNTRIES ARE COVERED AND MR. DOOLIN NAMED A NUMBER OF THEM, NOTING FOR EXAMPLE THAT THE ROK MOD PROGRAM IS SOME DOLS 230M BEHIND SCHEDULE. ANAND COMMENTED THAT CONTRARY TO SUCH COUNTRIES AS MALTA, THAILAND ""HAS NEVER BEEN THE BENEFICIARY OF MONEY IN RETURN FOR USE OF FACILITIES -- A MATTER OF RESENTMENT.""\n0. (S) ANAND SAID THAT DURING HIS RECENT VISIT TO BANGKOK THE PRIME MINISTER AND THE DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER WERE TALKING OF INCREASED US MILITARY ASSISTANCE LEVELS. ANAND SAID HE TOLD THEM THAT IS ""WISHFUL THINKING."" HOWEVER IT HELPS IF SUCH WORDS COME FROM THE ""HORSES MOUTH."" HE HOPED THAT SECRETARY CLEMENTS DELEGATION WOULD MINCE NO WORDS. IT IS BETTER FOR THE RTG TO HEAR REALISTICALLY WHAT THE PROSPECTS ARE.\n1. (S) MR. DOOLIN NOTED THAT NOW THAT THAILAND COMES UNDER MAP RATHER THAN MASF, CONSIDERABLE FLEXIBILITY HAS BEEN LOST. ANAND SAID THAT THE RTG KNOWS THE THEORETICAL DIFFERENCE BETWEEN MAP AND MASF BUT NOT THE PRACTICAL DIFFERENCES. MR. DOOLIN EXPLAINED THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS INVOLVED UNDER MAP AND THAT CONGRESS IS THE FINAL ARBITER OF OVERALL MAP    SECRET\n2. (S) IN CLOSING ANAND SAID THAT THERE ARE THREE ISSUES WHICH HE HOPES CAN BE COVERED DURING SECRETARY CLEMENTS MEETING WITH PRIME MINISTER, ON A CANDID AND FRANK BASIS: A. EXPECTATIONS FOR MILITARY ASSISTANCE, SO THAT THE RTG ENTERTAINS NO FALSE HOPES GIVEN THE MOOD OF CONGRESS. ANAND ADDED THAT HE SEES NOTHING BUT REDUCTIONS AHEAD. B. THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN MAP AND MASF. C. PROSPECTS FOR FURTHER US FORCE REDUCTIONS. MR. DOOLIN SAID THAT HE WOULD RELAY THIS TO SECRETARY CLEMENTS. GDS 31 DEC 81.\n",1367753

investment and OMD MAP for VietNam would create two                            major personnel problems:1 The skills for MAP administration are                            found almost exclusively in uniformed personnel who have staffed the                                MAAGs These could not be brought                            to VietNam in significant numbers because of the limitation on DAO uniformed personnel in relation to                            ceasefire2 It is questionable whether a staff adequate for administration of the                            worlds largest MAP could be                            accommodated at all under our DAO                            personnel ceilings JUSMAG Korea for                            example with a program equal to perhaps 25 per cent of the program                            contemplated for VietNam consists of over 400 authorized spacesE A large VietNam MAP would be                            continuously vulnerable to raiding by MAP administrators to meet shortages in other country                            programsF Additions to a requirement of some 134 billion for VietNam to the                            current request of some 650 million for all other countries creates                            such an obvious distortion that it would encourage disproportionate                            Congressional cuts which Vietnam would have to share with others to the                            loss of all This would be true even if VietNam MAP were as some have proposed a separate line item in                            the MAP legislationG And perhaps most importantly the transfer of VietNam military aid                            from MASF to MAP would signal to the enemy a lessened US commitment to give full support to the                                GVN and could encourage the North                            Vietnamese to mount another major offensive action or try to raise the                            level of subversive violence within South VietNam5 Over the years notably in the offensive of 1972 the enemy has taken                            crippling losses Despite his continuing belligerent position he has a                            number of weaknesses and vulnerabilities At the same time the GVN is slowly consolidating its political                            position and has shown itself militarily able to handle the North                            Vietnamese when it has the necessary equipment and other defense                            resources US objectives in VietNam are                            well on the way to achievement Therefore I simply will not accept the                            fact that something so vital to the final consolidation of that                            achievement can be so lightly thrown away simply because we do not make                            the effort we are capable of making on the Hill No one department can do it alone but a concerted                            wellplanned wellcoordinated effort by the White House State and                            Defense can certainly get MASF for                            VietNam extended to the end of FY                            19756 But it wont get done if we keep wringing our hands and telling each                            other how difficult it is and we must prepare for a fall back to MAP as a contingency If one really senior                            level person who knows the Hill                            is given a clear direction that it is MASF not MAP for VietNam                            and is given the capable assistance of one thousandth of the man hours                            we have already wasted in this exercise there will be no doubt of the                            outcome7 I make no apology for the bluntness of this message Its time we                            adjourned The Childrens Hour and got back to serious

the rest of the                            Washington bureaucracy takes the Presidents instruction as seriously as                            we do here we will get itMartin,frus1969-76v10d105,"1.  BELIEVE FIVE SPECIAL REFTEL REQUESTS OF KING SHOULD BE DISCUSSED WITHIN CONTEXT OF PAST AND PENDING MAP PROGRAMS IN JORDAN.  FOLLOWING REPRESENTS EFFORT BY USG BE RESPON- SIVE TO JORDANIAN NEEDS AT TIME OF GROWING CONSTRAINTS ON BOTH AVAILABILITY AND FUNDING FOR MILITARY ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS.  \n2.  BELIEVE AT THIS POINT YOU SHOULD ELABORATE FOR KING EXTRAORDINARY EFFORT USG MAKING TO MEET JORDANIAN NEEDS    SECRET  THIS YEAR.  CONGRESS HAS NOT YET VOTED A BILL.  THE SENATE AUTHORIZATION FOR MAP MATERIAL CALLS FOR 420 MILLION DOLLARS AND THE HOUSE AUTHORIZATION FOR 550 MILLION DOLLARS. PROBABLE COMPROMISE IS LIKELY TO BE UNDER 500 MILLION DOLLARS WHICH SHOULD BE COMPARED TO ADMINISTRATION REQUEST OF 652 MILLION DOLLARS.  AS RESULT, WE HAVE HAD TO TRY TO PROJECT WHERE CUTS WOULD BE MADE.  \n3.  AT MOMENT USG HAS AUTHORITY TO OBLIGATE ONLY 123 MILLION DOLLARS IN FIRST QUARTER.  FIRST PRIORITY IS GOING TO CAMBODIA FOR A SHOOTING WAR.  THE NEXT LARGEST CHUNK IS GOING INTO F5E AIRCRAFT, FOR JORDAN AND KOREA.  NO OTHER   EQUIPMENT FOR ANY OTHER COUNTRY IS BEING FUNDED IN THIS QUARTER.  REMAINDER GOES TO TRAINING, PCHT AND ADMINISTRA- TIVE COSTS.  THE SECOND QUARTER PROMISES EVEN LESS LATITUDE OF CHOICE.  \n4.  DESPITE MANY DIFFICULTIES INVOLVED, THE USG IS PREPARED TO DIVERT FROM INVENTORIES OF ITS OWN AIR FORCE ONE C-130B AIRCRAFT.  THIS AIRCRAFT WOULD BE AVAILABLE IMMEDIATELY FOR RECONDITIONING AND BE EXACTLY LIKE THE AIRCRAFT NOW IN RJAF INVENTORY.  IF AMBASSADOR FEELS APPROPRIATE AND CON- SISTENT WITH DISCUSSION REPORTED IN AMMAN 4749, HE MAY INFORM KING THAT WE PLAN APPLY TO C-130B 2.1 MILLION DOLS PROGRAMMED IN FY 73 RPT 73 FOR HELICOPTERS.  THESE MAP FUNDS NOW AVAILABLE FOR REPROGRAMMING AS RESULT KINGS HELICOPTER CANCELLATION AND ARE SUFFICIENT TO FUND C-130B WHICH COSTS APPROXIMATELY 1.3 MILLION DOLS.  THIS INCLUDES COST OF AIRCRAFT, RECONDITIONING, AND ONE SPARE ENGINE. FYI.  2.3 MILLION DOLS ORIGINALLY PLANNED FOR BALANCE OF UH1HS IN FY 74 RPT 74 IS NOT RPT NOT AVAILABLE BECAUSE OF ANTICIPATED FY 74 MAP APPROPRIATION SHORTAGES.  END FYI. EXCHANGE OF C-119S IS NOT RPT NOT POSSIBLE.  MAP FUNDS TO REHABILITATE THESE AIRCRAFT HAVE LONG SINCE BEEN SPENT AND THERE IS NO OTHER MAP PROGRAM IN WHICH THESE AIRCRAFT MIGHT BE USED, THUS FREEING FUNDS FOR JORDAN.  IN VIEW JAF PROBLEMS WITH 3 C-119S AND O AND M BURDEN TO MAINTAIN THEM, U.S. WILL PROBABLY WISH TO REPOSSESS THEM FOR DISPOSAL PURPOSES.      SECRET  5.  WE HOPE (ALTHOUGH THIS BY NO MEANS CERTAIN AT THIS TIME) TO BE ABLE TO FUND FULL FY 74 COST OF F5E PACK- AGE WHICH MIGHT COST AS MUCH AS 31.9 MILLION DOLS.  FUND- ING LAST SIX M60A1  TANKS IN FY 74 (AND 0.3 MILLION DOLS COMMO GEAR) WILL DEPEND ON WHETHER OTHER FUNDS AVAILABLE AFTER COVERING F5E PACKAGE.  HOWEVER, BALANCE OF 32 FUNDED BUT UNDELIVERED TANKS, WHICH WE PREVIOUSLY ACCELERATED BY DIVERSION FROM USA UNITS, WOULD ARRIVE ON SCHEDULE.  AS OF NOW, ALL TANKS (EXCEPT UNFUNDED SIX) WILL BE AVAILABLE FOR SHIPMENT TO JORDAN WITHIN 6-7 MONTHS.  FURTHER ACCELERA- TION OF M-60A1 TANK DELIVERIES HAS BEEN CONSIDERED, AS RE- QUESTED BY THE KING, BUT CANNOT BE ACCOMPLISHED BECAUSE THAT WOULD BE EXTREMELY DISRUPTIVE INTERRUPTION OF PRODUC- TION LINE (SINCE JAF TANKS ARE WITHOUT ADD-ON STABILIZATION\n6.  IN ADDITION TO FUNDS FOR F5ES, USG PLANS TO PROVIDE FUNDS FOR TRAINING AND SUPPLY OPERATIONS.  WE REGRET POS- SIBLE SHORTFALL, BUT DO NOT VIEW IT AS INCONSISTENT WITH OUR RELATIONSHIP OF COOPERATION AND MUTUAL UNDERSTANDING.\n7.  POSSIBLE REDUCTION OF FY 74 PROGRAM SHOULD BE VIEWED AGAINST RECENT DELIVERIES OF LARGE QUANTITIES OF EXCESS DEFENSE ARTICLES (EDA) (WHICH WERE VALUED AT 20.5 MILLION DOLS ACQUISITION COST IN FY 73) AND PROVISION OF 9 MILLION DOLS IN ADDITIONAL UNPROGRAMMED MAP THAT WE FURNISHED IN FY 72-73.  LATTER INCLUDES ONE C-130B, ONE F-104B REHAB., 20 TWO AND ONE HALF TON TRUCKS, AND 5.4 MILLION DOLS IN SPARE PARTS.  EQUIPMENT PROVIDED UNDER EDA  WAS IMPORTANT CONTRIBUTION TO JORDAN DEFENSE, AND COMPLETELY OVER AND ABOVE REFUNDED MAP PROGRAMS.  EDA ALLO- CATED TO JORDAN IN FY 73 ALONE INCLUDED 1220 TRUCKS, 45 SELF-PROPELLED 40 MM GUNS, 6 CENTURION TANKS, SEVEN 26- FOOT BOATS, 297 TRAILERS, ENGINEERING EQUIPMENT LIKE SCRAPERS, LOADERS AND CRANES, GENERATORS, AMMO, COMMO SPARES, AND VARIOUS OTHER ITEMS.  IN U.S. VIEW, MILITARY AID TO JORDAN HAS SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED NOT DECLINED, OVER PAST FEW YEARS, IN LINE WITH INCREASE IN SUPPORTING ASSISTANCE, WHICH HAS ALSO HELPED TO COVER GROWING MILI- TARY COSTS OF LAST THREE YEARS.  IN LAST TWO YEARS JORDAN HAS BEEN CUT APPROXIMATELY 10 PER CENT AS OPPOSED TO WORLDWIDE PROGRAM CUTS OF 40 PER CENT.  AT THIS POINT    SECRET  WE CANNOT TELL EXTENT OF WORLDWIDE CUTS IN FY 74 BUT WE EXPECT THEY WILL BE AS MUCH AS OR GREATER THAN IN PAST 2 YEARS.  \n8.  IF ASKED, AMBASSADOR MAY SAY THAT WE WILL BE HAPPY TO DISCUSS ALTERNATE HELICOPTER IN CONTEXT OF ON-GOING MAP PROGRAM.  DISCUSSION CAN TAKE PLACE WITH JAF OFFICERS AT NEXT US-GOJ MILITARY CONFERENCE.  \n9.  KING ALSO RAISED 2 QUESTIONS WHICH NOT TIED TO MAP FUNDING.  ACCELERATION OF F5E DELIVERIES AND REPLACEMENT FOR SALADIN ARMORED CARS.  \n0.  F5ES:  FYI.  ONLY FEASIBLE F5E SOURCES ARE PRODUCTION FOR IRAN, KOREA AND VIETNAM.  DIVERSION OR LOAN FROM THESE COUNTRIES IS EXTREMELY DIFFICULT FOR COMPELLING MILITARY AND POLITICAL REASONS, AS WELL AS FOR TECHNICAL REASONS ARISING FROM PRODUCTION SCHEDULES AND INCOMPATIBILITY WITH JORDANIAN F5E CONFIGURATION AND GROUND SUPPORT FACILITIES. YOU SHOULD NOT DISCLOSE OR COMMENT ON THESE POSSIBILITIES. END FYI.  YOU MAY INFORM GOJ THAT AFTER CAREFUL CONSIDERA- TION ALL POSSIBLE ALTERNATIVES, WE UNFORTUNATELY HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE FIND PRACTICABLE WAY TO ACCELERATE F5E DELIV- ERIES; FACT THAT JORDANIAN AIR FORCE WOULD BE PREPARED TO RECEIVE AIRCRAFT ONLY 4 TO 6 MONTHS IN ADVANCE OF CURRENT DELIVERY SCHEDULE SEEMS MAKE IT ADVISABLE STICK TO PRESENT SCHEDULE.  F5ES ARE ONLY NOW BEGINNING TO COME OFF PRODUC- TION LINE AND VIRTUALLY ALL OF FIRST YEARS PRODUCTION IS ALREADY COMMITTED.  \n1.  USG HAS MADE EXTRAORDINARY EFFORT TO SUPPORT THE REQUEST OF KING FOR M-48A3 DIESEL TANK AS REPLACEMENT FOR\n3.8 MILLION DOLLARS).  PCHT, CSP AND ADMIN COSTS WOULD BE ADDITIONAL.  RUSH\n",1357953

Telegram 6462 from Tehran September 12 described an                            article in the officiallyinspired Iranian press which argued that                            policymakers in Iran wanted the industrial nations to adopt zero growth                            policies and to receive a moderate shock from OPECs meeting on oil prices which was scheduled for                            September 1516 Ibid RG 59 Central                            Foreign Policy Files no film number1 At end of audience granted to introduce General Duval Brett new Chief of ARMISHMAAG Shah referred to increased                        crude oil prices in Indonesia Nigeria and Venezuela He commented Granted                        that much of this oil is of low sulphur content it would not make sense for                        us to ask less for our oil than they are getting for theirs The Shah then                        switched to a discussion of commodity and other price rises stating It is                        fantastic how prices of food and other items have risen in the United                        States Some are up 3 and 4 hundred percent Where is all this going to                        bring us As oil prices go up it will cause even further increases in the                        price of goods and commodities which we must import I never anticipated                        that the increases would come so fast or be so large If you and the                        Europeans do not get together and do something about these spiralling                        prices I cannot see how serious trouble for the Western economy can be                        avoided At this point I moved in to emphasize favorable crop reports from                        the United States which would have some effect on existing food prices I                        also pointed out that the United States had this year planted 55 million                        additional acres of food which in ten months to a year would inevitably have                        an effect not only on availability but also on prices From the expression                        on his face it was clear that the Shah had not appreciated the significant                        dimension of this US agricultural move2 As indicated in reftel B the Shah                        is not only deeply concerned but also torn over how to proceed in the                        economic field He said that he intended to keep down the price of domestic                        wheat since he had found it difficult to reduce prices once they had been                        raised and he emphasized the problems he has with prices and shortages on                        such items as sugar vegetable oil fertilizer and particularly cement It                        is interesting to note that his                        preoccupation with the economy has suddenly come into focus within the last                        two weeks since he made no mention of these matters when I had an hours                        talk with him on August 283 The Shah said nothing to indicate that the prognoses about oil prices in                        reftels A and B are inaccurate4 Comment: There have been many indications from                            GOI Ministries of growing concern over                        the effects of world inflationary pressures on Irans own price                            stabilityIn airgram A166 from Tehran                            November 17 the Embassy observed that Iranian inflation was seriously                            affecting the poor who found various essential food items either                            unavailable or too costly and that the recent strike in Abadan see                            footnote 4 below showed the importance of quick action As it has in                            the past the government has taken notice of the complaints but GOI actions made doubly difficult by                            inefficiency and corruption have been largely cosmetic and have                            sometimes tended to worsen the situation The Embassy concluded that                            the most important domestic reasons for the inflation were an increased                            money supply too few goods booming economic growth and large                            budgetary deficits caused by high military expenditures National                            Archives RG 59 Central Files 197073                            E 81 IRAN The Shah has long been proud of GOI extraordinary record in this regard                        However it is becoming more and more expensive for Iran to continue to                        subsidize wheat meat sugar vegetable oil and other sales to the public                        Failure to do so now would cause serious and perhaps active                            dissatisfactionTelegrams 6747 and 6796 from                            Tehran September 22 and 24 reported on the strikes at the Abadan and                            Bandar Mahshahr oil refineries where to offset recent price hikes                            workers demanded new ration cards for the company store and a 20 percent                            salary increase Ibid Central Foreign Policy Files no film                            numbers In telegram 6822 September 25 the Embassy noted that the                            government was refusing to give in to workers demands and that refinery                            officials were blaming Iraqis for orchestrating the strike Ibid                            According to telegram 6900 from Tehran September 27 the strike had                            ended due to managements threats of violence but that future                            disturbances were likely Ibid These concerns have obviously                        found their way to the Shah in concentrated form He appears to be seeking                        so far without success to find a rational way to approach these multiple                        problems It seems clear that he is torn on the one hand by the need to keep                        his international image as a leader in petroleum affairs intact and on the                        other by a growing realization of the direct effects of international price                        increases on Irans own economic developmentAccording to telegram 7127 from Tehran October 8 the Shahs opening                            speech to Parliament included a pledge to cut back on imports and                            increase domestic production while promising a salary increase for                            government workers by 1978 ongoing government subsidies for staples                            and committees to combat profiteering This speech the Embassy wrote                            emphasizes ineffectiveness to date of government control programs                            Imperial proposals for solution show no intention to abandon past policy                            of favoring industrialists and industryrelated imports However                            proposals do seem to presage belttightening for consumers in some                            sectors IbidHelms,frus1969-76v27d35,"1.

AS INDICATED IN REFTEL (B), THE SHAH IS NOT ONLY DEEPLY CONCERNED BUT ALSO TORN OVER HOW TO PROCEED IN THE ECONOMIC FIELD. HE SAID THAT HE INTENDED TO KEEP DOWN THE PRICE OF DOMESTIC WHEAT SINCE HE HAD FOUND IT DIFFICULT TO REDUCE PRICES ONCE THEY HAD BEEN RAISED, AND HE EMPHASIZED THE PROBLEMS HE HAS WITH PRICES AND SHORTAGES ON SUCH ITEMS AS SUGAR, VEGETABLE OIL, FERTILIZER, AND PARTICULARLY CEMENT. IT IS INTERESTING TO NOTE THAT HIS PREOCCUPATION WITH THE ECONOMY HAS SUDDENLY COME INTO FOCUS WITHIN THE LAST TWO WEEKS SINCE HE MADE NO MENTION OF THESE MATTERS WHEN I HAD AN HOURS TALK WITH HIM ON AUGUST 28.\n3. THE SHAH SAID NOTHING TO INDICATE THAT THE PROGNOSES ABOUT OIL PRICES IN REFTELS (A) AND (B)  ARE INACCURATE.\n4. COMMENT: THERE HAVE BEEN MANY INDICATIONS FROM GOI MINISTRIES OF GROWING CONCERN OVER THE EFFECTS OF WORLD INFLATIONARY PRESSURES ON IRANS OWN PRICE STABILITY. THE SHAH HAS LONG BEEN PROUD OF GOI EXTRAORDINARY RECORD IN THIS REGARD. HOWEVER, IT IS BECOMING MORE AND MORE EXPENSIVE FOR IRAN TO CONTINUE TO SUBSIDIZE WHEAT, MEAT, SUGAR, VEGE- TABLE OIL AND OTHER SALES TO THE PUBLIC. FAILURE TO DO SO NOW WOULD CAUSE SERIOUS AND PERHAPS ACTIVE DISSATISFACTION. THESE CONCERNS HAVE OBVIOUSLY FOUND THEIR WAY TO THE SHAH IN CONCENTRATED FORM. HE APPEARS TO BE SEEKING, SO FAR WITHOUT SUCCESS, TO FIND A RATIONAL WAY TO APPROACH THESE MULTIPLE PROBLEMS. IT SEEMS CLEAR THAT HE IS TORN ON THE ONE HAND BY THE NEED TO KEEP HIS INTERNATIONAL IMAGE AS A LEADER IN PETROLEUM AFFAIRS INTACT AND ON THE OTHER BY A GROWING REALIZATION OF THE DIRECT EFFECTS OF INTERNATIONAL PRICE INCREASES ON IRANS OWN ECONOMIC DEVELOP- MENT.

CANADIAN CRUDE OIL PRODUCTION HAS CONSEQUENTLY BEEN SOLD IN THE U.S. AT THE OPPORTUNITY PRICES AVAILABLE AND THE DOMESTIC CANADIAN CONSUMER HAS SEEN THIS U.S. DEMAND RAISE HIS PRICES TOO. THE PRICES OF PETROLEUM PRODUCTS INCLUDING GASOLINE AND HOME HEATING OIL IN CANADA TODAY HAVE REACHED THE POINT WHERE THE GOVERN- ENT BELIEVES IMMEDIATE MEASURES ARE REQUIRED TO STABILIZE THE ACTION OF THE MARKETPLACE IN THE INTEREST OF CONSUMERS AND THE RATIONAL DEVELOPMENT OF CANADIAN INDUSTRY. ACCORD- INGLY THE FOLLOWING MEASURES ARE BEING ANNOUNCED: (1) THE OIL INDUSTRY WILL BE ASKED TO REFRAIN FROM FURTHER PRICE INCREASES TO CANADIAN CONSUMERS BEFORE JANUARY 30, 1974. THIS PRICE RE- STRAINT WOULD APPLY EXCEPT WHERE, TO THE SATISFACTION OF THE MINISTER OF ENERGY, MINES AND RESOURCES, THE INCREASE IN THE COST OF IMPORTED CRUDE OIL WARRANTS A CANADIAN PRICE INCREASE. (2) THE GOVERNMENT INTENDS TO SEEK A CONTROL MECHANISM WHEREBY HIGHER PRICES IN THE U.S. MARKET WOULD NOT AUTOMATICALLY INCREASE PRICES AT HOME IN CANADA. AN EXPORT TAX, OR A NATIONAL OIL MARKETING BOARD ARE TWO POSSIBLE CONTROL MECHANISMS. DISCUSSIONS WILL BE HELD AS SOON AS POSSIBLE WITH PROVINCES UNCLASSIFIED  AND INDUSTRY PRIOR TO THE INTRODUCTION OF LEGISLATION. (3) THE GOVERNMENT WILL ALSO HOLD EARLY CONSULTATIONS WITH PROVINCES AND INDUSTRY ON THE EXTENSION OF PIPELINE FACILITIES SO AS TO ENABLE CANADIAN OIL TO BE SHIPPED INTO MONTREAL.

YAMANI STATEMENTS MADE IN EXCLUSIVE INTERVIEW WITH MIDDLE EAST ECONOMIC SURVEY (MEES) AND PUSLISHED IN SEPTEMBER\n2. TO OPEN INTERVIEW, MEES ASKED YAMANI TO COMMENT ON SCOPE OF SEPTEMBER 15 OPEC DISCUSSIONS. TEXT HIS REPLY FOLLOWS: ""TEHRAN AGREEMENT IS EITHER DEAD OR DYING AND IN NEED OF EXTENSIVE REVISION. ONE HAS ONLY TO LOOK AT THE WAY MARKET PRICES HAVE OVERTAKEN POSTED PRICES TO REALIZE THIS. QUITE SOME TIME AGO, QATAR SUCCEEDED IN SELLING ITS 1973-75 PARTICIPATION CRUDE ENTITLEMENTS AT PRICES WELL ABOVE PRE- VAILING POSTINGS, AND SINCE THEN WE HAVE HAD DAILY REMINDERS OF HOW FAR POSTED PRICES ARE LAGGING BEHIND REPRESENTATIVE MARKET REALIZATIONS IN GULF AREA. WE IN SAUDI ARABIA WOULD HAVE WISHED TO STICK TO AND HONOR TEHRAN AGREEMENT, BUT THERE HAS BEENA DRAMATIC CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCES, BROUGHT ABOUT BY FORCES BEYOND OUR CONTROL, NAMELY, FIERCE UPWARD PRESSURE ON PRICES AS A RESULT OF RISING DEMAND FOR CRUDE. THESE DEVELOPMENTS HAVE COMPELLED US TO RECONSIDER UNCLASSIFIED OUR POLICY VIS-A-VIS TEHRAN AGREEMENT WHICH WE NOW FEEL SHOULD BE AMENDED AS FOLLOWS:    ""1() THERE SHOULD BE A SIZEABLE LUMP SUM INCREASE IN POSTED PRICES IN ORDER TO ELEVATE THEM SUFFICIENTLY ABOVE MARKET REALIZATIONS TO PERMIT THEM TO RESUME THEIR FUNCTION AS REALISTIC TAX REFERENCE PRICES.    ""(2) MECHANISM SHOULD BE DEVISED WHICH WOULD SERVE TO MAINTAIN POSTED PRICES ABOVE REALIZED PRICES AT ALL TIMES.    ""(3) THE ANNUAL INCREASE IN POSTED PRICES OF 2.5 PERCENT FOR INFLATION PLUS 5 CENTS/BBL PROVIDED FOR IN TEHRAN AGREEMENT SHOULD BE AMENDED TO REFLECT MORE REALISTICALLY CURRENT RATES OF WORLD-WIDE PRICE INFLATION"".\n3. MEES THEN ASKED WHAT HAPPENS IF COMPANIES FAIL TO RESPOND TO THESE DEMANDS. YAMANI REPLIED: ""YOU WILL RECALL THAT OPEC DECLARATORY STATEMATT OF PETROLEUM POLICY IN MEMBER COUNTRIES OF JUNE 158 GIVES GOVERNMENTS OF MEMBERS COUNTRIES UNEQUIVOCAL RIGHT TO DETERMINE POSTED OR TAX-REFERENCE PRICES IN SUCH MANNER AS TO PREVENT ANY DETERIORATION IN THEIR RELATIONSHIP TO PRICES OF MANUFACTURED GOODS TRADED INTERNATIONALLY. IF WE FAIL TO OBTAIN THE COOPERATION OF THE OIL COMPANIES IN AMDNDING THE TEHRAN PRICE AGREEMENT, WE WOULD HAVE TO EXERCISE OUR RIGHTS ON OUR OWN"".\n4. IN RESPONSE ANOTHER QUESTION, YAMANI DENIED SAYING, AS HE HAS BEEN QUOTED RECENTLY, THAT SAUDI ARABIA DID NOT CONSIDER EXISTING PARTICIPATION AGREEMENTS IN SAUDI ARABIA AND OTHER GULF COUNTRIES AS FINAL, ADDING ""THIS DOES NOT MEAN TO IMPLY THAT WE WILL STICK TO THE AGREEMENT OR THAT WE ARE PLANNING TO CHANGE IT"". (HERE MEES COMMENTED THAT YAMANI AND ARAMCO PARENTS HAVE BEEN ""EXCHANGING VIEWS"" ON PARTICIPATION MATTERS IN RECENT WEEKS, WITH NEXT MEETING SCHEDULED FOR SEPTEMBER 13 IN NEW YORK. MEES THINKS FUTURE NEGOTIATIONS POSSIBLE).\n5. FINALLY, YAMANI REITERATED THAT SAUDI POLICY FOR PARTICIPATION CRUDE SALES REMAINS ONE OF DEALING ONLY WITH ""BUYER-USERS"". HE WARNED THAT PROSPECTIVE BUYERS WHO DEAL WITH ""SELF-STYLED INTERMEDIARIES WILL DESTROY THEIR PROSPECTS OF OBTAINING SAUDI PARTICIPATION UNCLASSIFIED CRUDE THROUGH AUTHORIZED CHANNELS"".

Telegram 6462 from Tehran September 12 described an                            article in the officiallyinspired Iranian press which argued that                            policymakers in Iran wanted the industrial nations to adopt zero growth                            policies and to receive a moderate shock from OPECs meeting on oil prices which was scheduled for                            September 1516 Ibid RG 59 Central                            Foreign Policy Files no film number1 At end of audience granted to introduce General Duval Brett new Chief of ARMISHMAAG Shah referred to increased                        crude oil prices in Indonesia Nigeria and Venezuela He commented Granted                        that much of this oil is of low sulphur content it would not make sense for                        us to ask less for our oil than they are getting for theirs The Shah then                        switched to a discussion of commodity and other price rises stating It is                        fantastic how prices of food and other items have risen in the United                        States Some are up 3 and 4 hundred percent Where is all this going to                        bring us As oil prices go up it will cause even further increases in the                        price of goods and commodities which we must import I never anticipated                        that the increases would come so fast or be so large If you and the                        Europeans do not get together and do something about these spiralling                        prices I cannot see how serious trouble for the Western economy can be                        avoided At this point I moved in to emphasize favorable crop reports from                        the United States which would have some effect on existing food prices I                        also pointed out that the United States had this year planted 55 million                        additional acres of food which in ten months to a year would inevitably have                        an effect not only on availability but also on prices From the expression                        on his face it was clear that the Shah had not appreciated the significant                        dimension of this US agricultural move2 As indicated in reftel B the Shah                        is not only deeply concerned but also torn over how to proceed in the                        economic field He said that he intended to keep down the price of domestic                        wheat since he had found it difficult to reduce prices once they had been                        raised and he emphasized the problems he has with prices and shortages on                        such items as sugar vegetable oil fertilizer and particularly cement It                        is interesting to note that his                        preoccupation with the economy has suddenly come into focus within the last                        two weeks since he made no mention of these matters when I had an hours                        talk with him on August 283 The Shah said nothing to indicate that the prognoses about oil prices in

that                            the most important domestic reasons for the inflation were an increased                            money supply too few goods booming economic growth and large

included a pledge to cut back on imports and                            increase domestic production while promising a salary increase for                            government workers by 1978 ongoing

SUMMARY. SINCE LATE SPRING, FOOD PRICES HAVE RISEN SHARPLY. POPULAR REACTION HAS THUS FAR, BEEN CONFINED TO FAIRLY LOW-KEY GRUMBLING. THERE IS SOME POSSIBILITY, HOWEVER, THAT THE REACTION COULD TURN UGLY AND TAKE THE FORM OF LOCALIZED SPORADIC VIOLENCE DIRECTED AGAINST MERCHANTS IN THE DOWNTOWN AND LOW-INCOME AREAS OF KINGSTON AND MONTEGO BAY. END SUMMARY\n2. SINCE THE REMOVAL OF GOVERNMENT SUBSIDIES REPORTED REFTEL, THERE HAS BEEN AN ACCELERATION OF THE COST OF LIVING SPIRAL WHICH BEGAN IN LATE SPRING. A FEW REPRESENTATIVE AND NECESSARILY APPROXIMATE EXAMPLES OF SUCH INCREASES OF CONTROLLED STAPLES FOLLOW.\n3. THERE HAS BEEN MUCH GRUMBLING ABOUT THE PRECIPITOUS RISE IN FOOD PRICES. THE OPPOSITION HAS ATTEMPTED TO LAY THE BLAME ON THE PRESENT GOVERNMENT AND DEMANDED A REINSTATEMENT OF SUBSIDIES. THE FARMERS ARE CALLING FOR HIGHER PRICES. THE PUBLIC IS, OF COURSE, UNABLE TO DO ANYTHING. THE GOVERNMENT, HASTILY DISCLAIMS RESPONSIBILITY, PASSES THE BLAME TO THE US AND OTHER MAJOR SUPPLIERS, AND ARGUES THAT THE POLICIES OF THE PREVIOUS GOVERMENT HAVE BROUGHT ABOUT THE PRESENT SITUATION. THE TRUTH IS THAT JAMAICA IS CAUGHT IN THE SAME SITUATION AS MOSTOTHER COUNTRIES AND THAT THE GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN REMISS FOR HOLDING THE LINE ON PRICES FOR SO LONG, THUS COMPOUNDING THE PRICE INCREASES WHEN THEY FINALLY TOOK PLACE.\n4. WHILE RAPID INCREASES IN THE COST OF LIVING ARE COMMON PLACE THROUGHTOUT THE WORLD, THE INCREASE HAS BEEN ESPECIALLY STEEP IN JAMAICA DURING THE PAST SEVERAL MONTHS. JAMAICA IS ALSO PLAGUES BY RECURRING SHORTAGES OF COOKING OIL, IMPORTED RICE, FLOUR, AND (BELIEVE IT OR NOT) SUGAR. THIS TIME, HOWEVER, NOT ONLY HAVE THE PRICES OF IMPORTED COMMODITIES AND STAPLES RISEN STEEPLY BUT THE PRICES OF LOCALLY PRODUCED STAPLES- BREADFRUIT, GREEN BANANAS, ACKEES, YAMS, AND COOKING OIL- ARE ALSO GOING OUT OF SIGHT AND THESE ITEMS FORM THE LIONS SHARE OF THE DIET OF JAMAICAS URBAN UNEMPLOYED AND POOR.\n5. WHILE THE RISING COU OF LIVING HAS NOT BEEN DIRECTLY LINKED BY THE GOVERNMENT OR PRESS TO THE RECENT SPURT IN THE CRIME RATE, THERE IS LITTLE DOUBT THAT IT PLAYS A ROLE - THE SUPPLY OF FREE MANGOES AND BREADFRUIT IS NOT LIMITLESS. IT HAS CLEARLY PLAYED A ROLE IN THE PRESENT ROUND OF WAGE SETTLEMENTS. THERE ARE NO PRESENT CLEAR INDICATIONS THAT PUBLIC REACTION TO THE RISING COST OF LIVING WILL MANIFEST ITSELF IN MORE UNPLEASENT WAYS. GIVEN CONFIDENTIAL THE LIVING CONDITIONS IN THE EXTENSIVE SLUMS OF WESTERN KINGSTON AND THE LARGE NUMBERS OF UNEMPLOYED IN THE AREA, HOWEVER, THERE IS A FAIR POSSIBILITY THAT SUCH REACTION COULD BECOME UGLY IN THE FORM OF AN OUTBREAK OF LOCALIZED AND SPORADIC VIOLENCE DIRECTED AGAINST RETAIL MERCHANTS IN THE DOWNTOWN LOW-INCOME AREAS OF KINGSTON AND MONTEGO BAY. WITH THE EXAMPLE SET OF THE UNIONIZED WORKER OBTAINING UP TO 50 PERCENT WAGE INCREASES IN SEVERAL IMPORTANT INDUSTRIES, THE URBAN POOR MAY FEEL THAT THEY HAVE NO OTHER RECOURSE. HEWITT\n",1357583

HE SAID ""ALMOST UNANIMOUS"" AGREEMENT WAS REACHED AT THAT MEETING REGARDING NEW POSTED PRICE PROPOSALS TO BE AIRED AT VIENNA OPEC MEETING. HE CLAIMED BELIEF AMONG GULF PRODUCING COUNTRIES THAT NEW PRICES WERE NEEDED PRECEEDED RECENT LIBYAN PRICE INCREASES, BUT HE ADMITTED THAT MAGNITUDE OF INCREASE THAT WILL BE SOUGHT IS FUNCTION OF RECENT DEVELOPMENTS IN LIBYA.\n2. GOK OFFICIAL SAID GULF PRODUCERS HAVE FELT FOR SOME TIME THAT GULF CRUDES UNDERVALUED AND THAT GOK, AT LEAST, WANTS PRICE THAT REFLECTS TRUE VALUE OF CRUDE OIL. IN ADDITION GOK WOULD LIKE TO SEE ADJUSTMENT PROCESS WORKED OUT THAT WOULD BE MORE OR LESS AUTOMATIC SO THAT FUTURE CRISES CAN BE AVOIDED AND PETROLEUM CAN BE DEPOLITICISED.

HE SAID GOK SEEKING ECONOMIC SOLUTIONS TO PROBLEMS SUCH AS PRICES AND INFLATION AND HE DISMISSED TALK OF ARAB BLACKMAIL OR USE OF OIL AS WEAPON. HE DID, HOWEVER, NOTE MUTUALITY OF INTERESTS AMONG PRODUCERS AND CONSUMERS AND NEED FOR LATTER, PARTICULARLY US, TO RECOGNIZE THAT RAPID ACCUMULATION OF DOLLARS RESULTING FROM HIGH LEVELS OIL PRODUCTION WITH ATTENDANT EXCHANGE RISKS WAS BOTHERSOME PROBLEM TO STATES SUCH AS KUWAIT.

INFO SUPPLIED BY TEDROS VERY MUCH AT VARIANCE WITH REPORT OF USG PARTICIPANTS AT PANAFTEL PROSPECTIVE DONORS MEETING HELD ITU HEADQUARTERS GENEVA MAY 21-22.\n2.PURPOSE OF THAT MEETING WAS TO GAUGE ATTITUDE OF POTENTIAL MAJOR DONORS TO CONTRIBUTING TO FUND.  COUNTRIES REPRESENTED INCLUDED CANADA, FRANCE, FRG, ITALY, JAPAN, UNCLASSIFIED NETHERLANDS, SWEDEN, UK AND US.  INVITEES WHO DID NOT APPEAR INCLUDED CHINA, SWITZERLAND AND USSR.\n3.  UPON QUESTIONING OF ADB AND OTHER AFRICAN OFFICIALS IT BECAME CLEAR THAT:\n4.  REACTION OF MOST PARTICIPANTS WAS NEGATIVE TO THIS APPROACH.  BRITISH AND FRENCH REPS WERE PARTICULARLY EMPHATIC IN STATING THEIR GOVTS UNABLE PARTICIPATE IN ANY MULTILATERAL FUND OF THIS NATURE AND SIGNIFIED INTENTION CONTINUE BILATERAL APPROACHES TO FUNDING OF TELECOM PROJECTS.  SEVERAL PARTICIPANTS INDICATED WILLINGNESS TO COORDINATE THEIR INDIVIDUAL BILATERAL TELECOM PROJECTS WITH PROPOSED NETWORK.\n5.  SUBSEQUENT ADB/ITU PROPOSAL FOR A FUNDING COORDINATION MECHANISM (COMMITTEE COMPOSED OF ADB, ITU, ECA, WORLD BANK AND DONOR COUNTRIES), ALSO FAILED OF AGREEMENT BECAUSE MOST PARTICIPANTS INDICATED THEY LACKED AUTHORITY TO APPROVE ESTABLISHMENT OF SUCH COMMITTEE.  THEREUPON PRESIDENT OF ADB LABIDI STATED THAT INFORMAL CONSULTATIVE MEETING WOULD BE CONVENED IN NOVEMBER 1973 AFTER PARTICIPANTS HAVE HAD OPPORTUNITY TO EXAMINE FINAL DETAILED CONSULTANTS REPORTS EXPECTED END OF AUGUST.  DATE AND PLACE OF MEETING WERE LEFT OPEN, ALTHOUGH AT ONE POINT LABIDI SUGGESTED ABIDJAN, ADB HEADQUARTERS, AS SITE.\n6.  SINCE CONCLUSION OF GENEVA MEETING, ONLY MATERIAL UNCLASSIFIED RECEIVED BY USG ON THIS SUBJECT HAS BEEN DRAFT MINUTES OF MEETING.  WE HAVE NOT RECEIVED ANY NOTICE OF SEPTEMBER 9 MEETING MENTIONED BY TEDROS, NOR HAVE DETAILED REPORTS PROMISED AT MAY MEETING ARRIVED.  FURTHERMORE, SINCE ITU PLENIPOTENTIARY CONFERENCE OPENS IN TORREMOLINOS, SPAIN, SEPTEMBER 14, WE STRONGLY DOUBT THAT TIME AND PLACE OF MEET- ING MENTIONED BY TEDROS COULD BE ACCURATE.

SUMMARY: SR NEED FOR LOCOMOTIVES APPEARS LEGITIMATE. MANAGEMENT A PROBLEM BUT IS RECEIVING IBRD ATTENTION. MAINTENANCE DEFICIENCIES DO NOT APPEAR INSURMOUNTABLE AND BEING REDUCED. LOCOMOTIVES ARE NUMBER ONE PRIORITY FOR SR AND MAJOR DEVELOPMENT NEED. PURCHASE JUSTIFIED FINANCIALLY. EMBASSY RECOMMENDS EXIM SUPPORT. END SUMMARY.\n2. FOLLOWING ARE EMBASSY COMMENTS ON QUERIES RAISED REF A AS WELL AS ON OTHER FACTORS WHICH WE BELIEVE SHOULD BE CONSIDERED BY EXIM IN MAKING DECISION RE FINANCING POSSIBLE SALE GM LOCOMOTIVES TO SR. RESPONSES BASED ON INFO AVAILABLE TO EMBASSY AS WELL AS DISCUSSION WITH U/S MIN TRANSCOMM, ABDEL MONEIM ABBAS (REF B) IN WHICH THESE ISSUES EXPLORED:\n5. OTHER EQUIPMENT SEPARATLY  BUDGETED. AS FOR FINANCING, MAJOR SOURCES ARE IBRD, FRG AID AND AFDB. U/S ABBAS STATED ONLY ANTICIPATED NEW COMMERCIAL LOANS (OTHER THAN EXIM) ARE SOME LS 1.4 MILLION FOR SPARED PARTS THROUGH ECGD, AND UNKNOWN, BUT MODERATE, AMOUNTS FROM SPANISH SOURCES TO ROUND OFF AFDB LOAN FOR WAGONS. THUS WHILE EXISTING DEBTS, AS ABBAS HIMSELF NOTED IN JULY, MAY BE SUBSTANTIAL, SRS PLANS AND MODERATE INCREASES DO NOT APPEAR OUT OF LINE.\n3. COMMENT: EMBASSY AGAIN RECOMMENDS IBRD AS EXCELLENT SOURCE DETAILED AND UP-TO-DATE INFO ON SR. UNLESS IBRD FACTS CONTRADICT THOSE AVAILABLE TO US, WE BELIVE EXISTING DATA ARGUE IN FAVOR APPROVING GOS/GM REQUEST FOR FINANCING. CLEARLY, POLITICAL FACTORS HAVE PUSHED NEED FOR LOCOMOTIVES TO CENTER STAGE AT THIS PARTICULAR MOMENT (AND, INCIDENTALLY, GIVEN  UNEXPECTED CHANCE TO US MANUFACTURERS). BUT THESE FACTORS,  WHILE OF MAJOR IMPORTANCE BOTH TO GOS INTERNALLY AS WELL AS TO USG IN TERMS OUR RELATIONS WITH THIS GOVERNMENT, DO NOT APPEAR CONFIDENTIAL  IN THIS INSTANCE TO HAVE DISTORTED EITHER PLANNING OR ECONOMIC FEASIBILITY CRITERIA. THEY HAVE ONLY SERVED HIGHLIGHT IMPORTANCE OF AND NEED FOR ACCELERATED IMPROVEMENT OF SR.\n4. ACTION REQUESTED: EXIM GIVE EMBASSY EARLIERST POSSIBLE INDICATION OF LIKELIHOOD CREDITS BEING EXTENED IN THIS CASE. DCM WAS VERY EXPLICIT IN POINTING OUT TO ABBAS EXIM PROCEDURES AS WELL AS CONSTRAINTS PLACED ON EXIM IN TERMS ITS RESPONSIBILITY TO CONGRESS TO MAINTAIN SOUND LENDING POLICIES. BUT, AS SHOWN DURING BOEING NEGOTIATIONS, GOS IS INCLINED BE OPTIMISTIC IN THESE MATTERS WITH ANY SHORTFALL BECOMING A BILATERAL ISSUE. THUS, EMB WOULD APPRECITE EARLIEST POSSIBLE INDICATION EXIM ATTITUDE. BREWER\n",1357951

EMBOFF RAISED QUESTION OF FRENCH LOAN FOR EXPANSION OF HA TIEN CEMENT PLANT WITH THEROND, OFFICIAL IN EXTERNAL BILATERAL RELATIONS, FRENCH TREASURY, DURING CONVERSATION ON RELATED SUBJECTS (SEPTEL). THEROND MADE THE FOLLOWING POINTS: (A) HA TIEN LOAN IS NOT OPERATION IN FRAMEWORK FRENCH AID TO INDO- CHINA, FOR WHICH PROGRAM NOT YET FIXED. NEGOTIATIONS ON AID TO SOUTH VIETNAM WILL GET UNDERWAY IN OCTOBER. (B) LOAN IS COMMERICAL, GUARANTEED BY COFACE, FRENCH SEMI-PUBLIC EXPORT-CREDIT INSURANCE AGENCY.THERE ARE NO PUBLIC FUNDS INVOLVED IN LOAN. IT HAS, HOWEVER, BEEN TREATED AS ""EXCEPTIONAL CASE,"" AND THUS LOW-INTEREST TERMS ARE POSSIBLE BY ""STRETCHING THE LIMITS OF COFACES TECHNICAL ARSENAL."" (C) NEGOTIATIONS ARE WELL ON ROAD TO COMPLETION, WITH ONLY SOME TECHNICAL POINTS REMAINING ABOUT WHICH HE COULD NOT GIVE DETAILS. HE DID NOTE THAT ONE QUESTION BEING DISCUSSED WAS FUNDS NECESSARY TO COVER INCREASED LOCAL COSTS (APPRENTLY A REFERENCE TO EXTRA 10 MILLION FRACS NOTED REFTEL B). IN SEPARATE CONVERSATION WITH QUAI OFFICIALS ANOTHER EMBOFF TOLD APPROVAL ALREADY GRANTED FOR ADDITIONAL 10 MILLION. CONFIDENTIAL  2. COMMENT: (A) COFACE IS INSURANCE AND NOT LENDING AGENCY. IT IS DIFFICULT TO SEE HOW FRENCH BANKS COULD MADE COMMERCIAL LOAN ON SUCH TERMS (""ABOUT 4 PERCENT,"" WHEN COST OF MONEY IS CURRENTLY MORE THAN DOUBLE THAT FIGURE) WITHOUT SOME SUBSIDIZATION BY GOVERN- MENT OF INTEREST RATE OR OTHER SUPPORT FROM PUBLIC FUNDS,  EXPRESSLY DENIED BY FRENCH TREASURY. THUS, WHILE WE FEEL WE DONT HAVE FULL STORY ON THIS OPERATION, WE SEE NO POSSIBILITY OF  DISCUSSING FURTHER WITH FRENCH AUTHORITIES. A MATTER GOFCLAIMS TO BE PRIVATE. (B) GIVEN NON-GOVERNMENTAL NATURE OF THIS LOAN, FRENCH REGARD ITS TERMS AS VERY FAVORABLE, WHEREAS GVN AND IMF REPRESENTATIVE TAKE OPPOSITE VIEW. IN ANY CASE, SINCE FRENCH TREASURY STATES LOAN IS OUTSIDE SCOPE FRENCH AID PROGRAM, ARGUMENT CAN BE MADE THAT IT IS NOT A PRESCEDENT FOR FUTURE LOANS OF FRANCE OR OTHER COUNTRIES WITHIN FRAMEWORK OFFICIAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS FOR VIET-NAM (PARA 3, REFTEL A).

ON SEPTEMBER 24, ASSISTANT SECRETARY NEWSOM CALLED ON FOREIGN MINISTER MENASSIE HAILE IN NEW YORK. FOLLOWING HIGHLIGHTS CONVERSATION:\n2. IEG WAS SURPRISED BY NEWS OF U.S. WITHDRAWAL FROM KAGNEW. WHILE SECRETARY RUSH HAD ADVISED EMPEROR THIS WAS POSSIBILITY, ACTION CAME MUCH SOONER THAN IEG EXPECTED. THEY WONDERED WHETHER THERE WAS SPECIAL REASON. NEWSOM ASSURED MINISTER REASON LAY IN CHANGES IN TECHNOLOGY AND IN FACT U.S. WAS CLOSING BASES AT HOME AS WELL AS ABROAD.\n3. DR. MENASSIE SAID HE UNDERSTOOD, BUT HE WAS CONCERNED THAT ABSENCE KAGNEW WOULD MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR USG TO JUSTIFY TO CONGRESS MILITARY ASSISTANCE FOR ETHIOPIA, ALTHOUGH ETHIOPIAS NEED WAS JUST AS GREAT. NEWSOM SAID US HAD ALWAYS JUSTIFIED ASSISTANCE TO ETHIOPIA, NOT ONLY ON BASIS KAGNEW, BUT ON ETHIOPIAN SUPPORT FOR COLLECTIVE SECURITY AND BROADER STRATEGIC INTERESTS IN HORN OF AFRICA. WE WOULD CONTINUE TO DO SO. MINISTER    SECRET\n4. NEWSOM STRESSED ASSURANCES OF CONTINUED U.S. INTEREST CONVEYED TO EMPEROR BY CHARGE. MINISTER SAID THESE WERE APPRECIATED, BUT CONCERN OVER ACTUAL LEVELS OF MILITARY ASSISTANCE CONTINUED. NEWSOM SAID WE WOULD TRY TO MAIN- TAIN AT PRESENT LEVELS AND THAT ADVICE ON THIS WOULD SHORTLY BE SENT TO ADDIS TO BE CONVEYED TO PRIORITIES COMMITTEE. MENASSIE SAID HE WOULD ALSO LIKE TO BE ADVISED AND ASKED WHAT PROPORTION OF TOTAL REQUEST MIGHT BE MET. NEWSOM REPLIED ANSWER WAS NOT IN THESE TERMS BUT WAS IN TERMS OF PRIORITY ITEMS.\n5. MINISTER SAID HE HOPED USG WOULD ACTUALLY SEE ETHIOPIAS POSITION IN GLOBAL STRATEGIC TERMS SINCE REAL PROBLEM WAS SOVIET POSITION IN SOMALIA. SOVIETS WERE USING THIS AS LEVER TO BRING CHANGES IN ETHIOPIAS POSITION AND HAD RESPONDED TO IEG OVERTURES BY PLACING THEIR AID TO SOMALIA IN JUXTAPOSITION WITH U.S. AID TO ETHIOPIA. IMPLICATION WAS THAT IF ETHIOPIA MORE FRIENDLY TO SOVIETS, PICTURE MIGHT BE DIFFERENT. CHINESE WERE ALSO READY TO HELP ETHIOPIA AS MEANS OF COUNTERING SOVIETS.\n6. IN RESPONSE TO QUESTION ON CURRENT STATUS OAU COMMITTEE ON HORN PROBLEM, MINISTER REPEATED ETHIOPIAS REJECTION OF TERMS INCLUDING 50 KM WITHDRAWAL PROPOSED IN ALGIERS MEETING. HE SAID NEW MEETING WOULD PROBABLY TAKE PLACE IN DECEMBER. HE ADDED THAT GENERAL GOWON AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMISSION HAD ASSURED IEG THAT THERE WAS NO SENTIMENT IN COMMITTEE FOR CHANGING BOUNDARIES BECAUSE OF TRIBAL DIVISIONS. END. SCALI\n",1357488

AT HIS REQUEST, AMB. KIFLE CALLED ON NEWSOM SEPT. 20. HE SAID HE HAD COME TO TRANSMIT IEGS ASSESSMENT OF POLITICAL DVELOPMENTS IN AREA SINCE EMPERORS VISIT TO PRESIDENT.  KIFLE INDICATED HIS GOVERNMENT HAD FEELING THAT ARABS TRIED TO ISOLATE ETHIOPIA DIPLOMATICALLY AT MAY OAU CONFERENCE.  WHILE ETHIOPIA HAD ALWAYS BEEN ARABS TARGET, THEY HAD NOW DECIDED TAKE OFFENSIVE, MAKING OVERT ATTACKS AND INTENTIONS PUBLIC.  IEG THOUGHT PLAN TO REMOVE OAU HEADQUARTERS FROM ADDIS WAS NOT SIMPLY LIBYAN INITIATIVE BUT WAS COORDINATED PLAN OF SEVERAL ARAB COUNTRIES.  ARABS REALIZED HEDAQUARTERS COULD NOT GO TO ANY ARAB CAPITAL BUT HOPED  TO GAIN BLACK AFRICAN SYMPATHY BY EVENTUALLY ENGINEERING  REMOVAL TO SUB-SAHARAN CONFIDENTIAL LOCATION, FOR EXAMPLE, NIGERIA.\n2.  KIFLE SAID IEG BELIEVED ARABS WERE NOT REALLY CONCERNED OVER ETHIOPIAN RELATIONS WITH ISRAEL, KNOWING THEY ARE NOT AS PORTRAYED BY ARAB PRESS, BUT IEG SURPRISED THAT ARABS CHOSE OAU CONFERENCE TO ATTACK THESE RELATIONS.  IEG BELIEVED ARABS WANTED ETHIOPIA CHANGE ITS POLICY VIS-A-VIS ISRAEL IN ORDER TO OPEN REST OF BLACK AFRICA TO ARAB MANEUVERS.\n3.  KIFLE ASSERTED THAT RECENT SOMALI CHALLENGE CONNECTED WITH ARAB DESIGNS AND THAT SOMALIS WERE ENCOURAGED BY ARABS WHO COORDINATED WITH SOMALIA THEIR ATTACK AT OAU CONFERENCE.  THIS OF GREAT CONCERN TO IEG.\n4.  ACCORDING TO KIFLE, IEG BELIEVES ARABS ARE DISTURBED BY ETHIOPIAN OIL POTENTIAL, WHICH THEY EXAGGERATE, AND BELIEVE FUTURE ETHIOPIAN PRODUCTION WOULD DEPRIVE THEM OF LEVER AGAINST WEST.  THIS CONSIDERATION ENTERED INTO ARAB DECISION TO STIMULATE SOMALI ACTION AGAINST POTENTIALLY OIL RICH OGADEN REGION.  ARABS, SAID KIFLE, CONTINUE TO REGARD REST OF AFRICA AS POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC BACK YARD OF ARAB WORLD.\n5. FINALLY, KIFLE SAID HE UNDER INSTRUCTIONS TO INQUIRE INTO STATUS OF IEG MILITARY ASSISTANCE REQUEST.\n6.  NEWSOM EXPRESSED APPRECIATION FOR RECEIVING ETHIOPIAN VIEWS AND SAID WE HAD NOTED LIBYAS EFFORT TO EMBARRASS ETHIOPIA AND GAIN SUPPORT FOR ITS POSITION AT OAU MEETING.  WE ALSO NOTED THAT MOST OTHER ARABS REMAINED SILENT SO ONE NOT SURE OF THEIR POSITION.  WE HAD FEELING LIBYA RECEIVED LITTLE SUPPORT FOR MOVING HEADQUARTERS FROM ADDIS, PERHAPS ONLY ONE OR TWO COUNTRIES.  (KIFLE CONCEDED THAT THIS WAS SO.)\n7.  NEWSOM SAID IT QUESTIONABLE WHETHER ARABS HAVE CAPACITY TO WORK IN UNITY SO THAT PRESSURES ON ETHIOPIA MIGHT AMOUNT TO SOMETHING.  WE HAVE IMPRESSION THAT SUDAN, FOR INSTANCE, IS NOT PREPARED TO ENGAGE IN HOSTILE CONFIDENTIAL ACTION.  NONETHELESS WE UNDERSTAND WHY ETHIOPIA HAS EVERY REASON TO BE VIGILANT.  FOR ITS PART, US DESIRES CONTINUE SUPPORT TO LIMITS POSSIBLE ETHIOPIAN DESIRE DEFEND ITSELF.\n8.  TURNING TO SECURITY ASSISTANCE, NEWSOM RECALLED THAT WE HAD MADE IT CLEAR TO MINISTER OF DEFENSE AND CHIEF OF STAFF WHEN THEY IN WASHINGTON THAT WE COULD NOT MEET VERY LARGE REQUESTS ON LIST SUBMITTED IN MAY.  WE HAD AGREED RECONVENE PRIORITIES COMMITTEE UNDER AMBASSADORS CHAIRMANSHIP AND IT HAD NOW SUBMITTED FIRST LIST.  THIS PROCESS STILL GOING ON.  WE EXPECTED AMBASSADOR MEET SHORTLY WITH EMPEROR TO INDICATE FY 74 DOLLAR GUIDELINES FOR PLANNING PURPOSES WHICH SUBJECT, OF COURSE, TO REDUCTION BY CONGRESS.\n9.  AFTER DESCRIBING CONGRESSIONAL AND OTHER DIFFICULTIES WE FACE IN TRYING INDICATE ASSISTANCE LIMITS NOW, NEWSOM SAID WE COULD NOT BE VERY DEFINITE UNTIL CONGRESS APPROVES SECURITY ASSISTANCE BUDGET.  OUR RESPONSE TO MOD REQUEST WILL BE COMMUNICATED THROUGH ESTABLISHED CHANNELS IN ADDIS AND WE SHALL SUBSEQUENTLY INFORM KIFLE OF CONTENTS.  NEWSOM WARNED AGAIN THAT OUR REPLY, ITSELF HIGHLY DEPENDENT ON FUTURE CONGRESSIONAL ACTION, WOULD NOT APPROACH VERY SUBSTANTIAL LEVELS REQUESTED. IN REPLY TO KIFLES QUESTION, HE INDICATED WE WOULD NOT BE ABLE COMMIT OURSELVES TO MULTI-YEAR PROGRAMS BECAUSE OF NECESSITY FOR ANNUAL CONGRESSIONAL APPRO- PRIATIONS.\n0.  AFTER HEARING NEWSOMS DESCRIPTION OF WYMANS CONVERSATION WITH EMPEROR ABOUT OUR PLANS FOR PHASE-DOWN AT KAGNEW, KIFLE INDICATED THAT IEG HAD EXPECTED IT TO HAPPEN EVENTUALLY, ALTHOUGH TIMING UNCERTAIN.  FONMIN MINASSE HAD ASKED HIM TO EXPRESS TO NEWSOM IEG HOPE THAT OTHERS WOULD NOT INTREPRET MOVE AS LOSS OF U.S. INTEREST IN THAT PART OF THE WORLD.  NEWSOM GAVE ASSURANCES THAT THIS CONSIDERATION HAD BEEN ONE OF CONFIDENTIAL PRIMARY CONCERNS DURING USG DISCUSSIONS ON MATTER AND THAT WE, TOO, WANT TO MAKE IT CLEAR THAT MOVE HAS NO SUCH EFFECT.  HE WAS SURE DR. KISSINGER WOULD CONVEY SIMILAR STRONG REASSURANCES TO MINASSE DURING THEIR EXPECTED MEETING IN NEW YORK.\n1.

SUMMARY: CHARGE SET FORTH DEPT VIEWS AS GIVEN REF A DURING CONVERSATION WITH PREMIER MORNING SEPT 1. THOUGH CCK DID NOT RENEW REQUEST FOR RETENTION ONE C-130 SQUADRON, HE WAS UNBENDING IN VIEW THAT PROPOSED SEPT 4 ANNOUNCE- MENT WOULD GIVE HIM GREAT DIFFICULTY AND COUNTER-PROPOSED ANNOUNCEMENT BY ROC. TWO HOURS LATER, WHILE EMBASSY WAS ABOUT TO TRANSMIT TELEGRAM REPORTING CONVERSATION, MINISTRY OF NATIONAL DEFENSE ISSUED UNILATERAL STATEMENT.    SECRET  CCKS HASTY ACTION TO PREEMPT US INDICATES DEPTH OF HIS OWN FEELING AND MAGNITUDE OF WHAT HE SEES AS HIS PROBLEMS. EMBASSY RECOMMENDS URGENT REMONSTRANCE TO CCK TO INFORM HIM OF OUR SURPRISE AND EMBARRASSMENT AND OUR DECISION TO PROCEED WITH OUR ORIGINAL ANNOUNCEMENT. END SUMMARY\n2. CHARGE WAS ABLE TO SEE PREMIER ALMOST IMMEDIATELY UPON RECEIPT REF A. AS DEPT HAD HOPED, WHEN TOLD DECISION WAS FIRM, CCK DID NOT RENEW REQUEST FOR RETENTION ONE C-130 SQUADRON ON TAIWAN. HOWEVER, HE WAS UNBENDING IN VIEW THAT OUR PROPOSED SEPT 4 ANNOUNCEMENT WOULD GIVE HIM TROUBLES WITHIN HIS OWN GOVERNMENT WHICH HE THOUGHT WE SHOULD HELP HIM TRY TO AVOID.\n3. CCK DID NOT DISPUTE REFTEL ARGUMENTS NOR DID HE DENY USG HAD MADE EFFORTS TO MEET HIS INITIAL SUGGESTION. RATHER, HE EMPHASIZED THAT OUR PROPOSED ANNOUNCEMENT WOULD ENCOURAGE BELIEF ON TAIWAN THAT USG HAD MADE UNI- LATERAL DECISION WITHOUT CONSULTING GRC, AND HAD DONE SO IN RESPONSE TO SOME UNDERSTANDING WITH PEKING. HE SAID THAT WERE USG TO MAKE CONTEMPLATED SEPT 4 ANNOUNCEMENT, WE WOULD GAIN ONLY A MARGINAL ADVANTAGE IN TERMS OF US INTERESTS AND IN SO DOING WOULD CAUSE HIM BASIC AND DIFFICULT PROBLEMS. CCK REFERRED TO SECRETARY SCHLESINGERS STATEMENT AND ASKED WHY ANYTHING FURTHER NEED BE SAID. HE ASKED THAT CHARGE CONVEY HIS VIEWS TO WASHINGTON. CHARGE ONCE AGAIN REVIEWED REASONS WE FAVORED ANNOUNCEMENT, ESPECIALLY ADVANTAGES TO BOTH US AND ROC OF ONE SIMPLE, GUIDED STATEMENT TO WHICH WE COULD REFER INEVITABLE QUESTIONS.\n4. AT VERY END OF CONVERSATION, CCK PROPOSED NEW IDEA WHICH,  SEEMINGLY HAD JUST COME TO MIND: SIMPLE, UNILATERAL STATEMENT BY GRC. CCK ASKED THAT CHARGE TRANSMIT THIS NEW IDEA TO WASHINGTON ASAP; HE WOULD MEANWHILE DISCUSS WITH HIS MILITARY STAFF. APPROXIMATELY TWO HOURS LATER, WHEN EMBASSY WAS ABOUT TO BEGIN TRANSMISSION OF REPORTING TELEGRAM, FOLLOWING ANNOUNCEMENT WAS ISSUED BY MILITARY SPOKESMAN OF MINISTRY OF NATIONAL DEFENSE: QUOTE WITH REGARD TO THE USAF TRANSPORT UNITS AT CCK AIRBASE IN SUPPORT OF THE WAR IN INDOCHINA, SINCE THE VIETMAN CEASEFIRE A    SECRET  PORTION OF THOSE UNITS HAVE STARTED TO WITHDRAW. THE REST WILL ALSO WITHDRAW IN THE FUTURE, ACCORDING TO PLAN. UNQUOTE.\n5. COMMENT: CCKS DECISION TO PREEMPT US IS AN EXTRAORDINARY ABERRATION IN THE WAY HE HAS HANDLED ALL SUCH MATTERS DURING THE PAST TWO YEARS. PRESUMABLY HE DECIDED TO RISK OUR INEVITABLY UNFAVORABLE REACTION BECAUSE THE ISSUE IS OF SUCH GREAT IMPORTANCE TO HIM IN HIS LEADERSHIP ROLE. IN FACT, WHEN WE GOT WORD OF THE ROC ANNOUNCEMENT WE WERE IN PROCESS OF RECOMMENDING THAT WE GIVE SYMPATHETIC CONSIDERATION TO HIS SUGGESTION SINCE WE THINK CCK DOES FACE A TRICKY SITUATION WITH MANY KEY ELEMENTS OF THIS SOCIETY AS IT IS FORCED TO MAKE PAINFUL ADJUSTMENTS IN RELATIONS WITH US.\n6. CCKS IDEA OF AN ROC ANNOUNCEMENT MAY HAVE BEEN INSPIRED BY THE EXAMPLE OF US-THAI CONSULTAIONS INVOLVING BOTH INFORMAL GOT STATEMENTS AND FORMAL USG/GOT ANNOUNCEMENT. IN ANY CASE, HIS PRIME MOTIVE INTAKING THE INITIATIVE WAS PROBABLY HOPE THAT IT WOULD BLUNT THE EDGE OF FEELINGS ON TAIWAN THAT THE ROC IS ESSENTIALLY A HELPLESS PAWN IN THE PROCESS OF STRATEGIC ADJUSTMENTS GOING ON IN EAST ASIA.\n7. ACTION REQUESTED: REQUEST DEPARTMENTS INSTRUCTIONS AS TO HOW WE SHOULD HANDLE REMONSTRANCE TO CCK. EMBASSY RECOMMENDS CHARGE BE INSTRUCTED TO CALL ON HIM URGENTLY AND TO STATE: A) USG SURPRISED AND EMBARRASSED BY ROCS UNILATERAL ACTION SINCE ISSUE WAS STILL UNDER DISCUSSION BETWEEN THE TWO GOVERNMENTS; AND B) USG WILL PROCEED WITH ITS OWN ANNOUNCEMENT ABOUT WITHDRAWALS OF C-130S FROM TAIWAN. WE WOULD PROPOSE DOING THIS WITH A TONE OF HURT RATHER THAN ANGER.\n8. PLEASE SLUG REPLY NIACT IMMEDIATE. GLEYSTEEN\n",1357834

SUMMARY: THERE WAS NAUGHT FOR PRIME MINISTERS COMFORT IN ADDRESSES TO PROGRESSIVE PARTYS THIRTEENTH NATIONAL CONGRESS IN DURBAN SEPTEMBER 3-4 BY FOUR BLACK HOMELAND LEADERS ESPECIALLY INVITED TO ATTEND AS ""OBSERVERS"" DESPITE PRIME MINISTERS THREATS ONLY SHORT TIME BEFORE (REFTEL). FOUR SPEAKERS, JUDICIOUSLY SPACED OVER TWO DAY MEETING, WERE UNANIMOUS IN THEIR ADAMANT REJECTION OF NATIONALIST GOVERNMENTS RACIAL POLICIES, IN THEIR FIRM DEMANDS FOR BASIC HUMAN RIGHTS FOR ALL CITIZENS IRRESPECTIVE OF COLOR AND THEIR NONE-TOO-SUBTLE HINTS OF IMPENDING DISASTER IF SOUTH AFRICAN WHITES REFUSED FUNDAMENTAL CHANGES IN NEAR FUTURE. ALL WERE ACCORDED STANDING OVATIONS BY ENTHUSIASTIC DELEGATES AND THEIR SPEECHES HIGHLIGHTED WHAT WOULD OTHERWISE HAVE BEEN ROUTINE PARTY CONGRESS.\n2. COLLINS RAMUSSI, DEPTY LEADER OF LEBOWA, LED FOUR HOMELAND SPEAKERS WITH SLASHING ATTACK ON GOVERNMENTS APARTHEID POLICIES, DEMAND FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE OF SUCH ""TRUE LEADERS"" AS NELSON MANDELA AND WALTER SIZULU AND REFUSAL CONDEMN TERRORIST ACTIVITY: ""DO WHITE PEOPLE ACTUALLY EXPECT US TO RESENT TERRORISTS WHEN THEY COME? WHEN THE TERRORISTS STRIKE...MUST WE NOT HELP THEM?"" PROFESSOR NTSANWISI OF GAZANKULU INSISTED THAT HOUR OR DECISION HAD ARRIVED, THAT DECISIONS MUST HENCEFORTH BE MADE JOINTLY BY WHITES AND BLACKS TOGETHER AND THAT POINT HAD BEEN REACHED WHERE CONTINUED SECURITY OF WHITES NOW IN HANDS OF SA BLACKS. M.T. MOLATHLAWA OF BAPHUTHATSWANA, AS DID THE OTHER BLACK SPEAKERS, WARMLY PRAISED PROGRESSIVE PARTY FOR ITS EFFORTS IN BEHALF OF NON-WHITES BUT WARNED THAT AFRICANS WERE FAST LOSING CONFIDENCE IN WHITE MAN. CHIEF BUTHELEZI OF KWAZULU, IN MOST MODERATE OF FOUR SPEECHES, USED PLATFORM AFFORDED HIM TO PUT FORWARD IMPORTANT NEW PROPOSAL FOR INCLUSION IN HOMELAND CONSTITUTIONS, AND EVENTUALLY IN SOUTH AFRICAN CONSTITUTION, OF BILL OF BASIC HUMAN RIGHTS BASED ON UNIVERSAL DECLARATION OF HUMAN RIGHTS. SUCH CONSTITUTIONAL SAFEGUARDS, ""PLACED BEYOND REACH OF FLEETING MAJORITIES, PASSING CONTINGENCIES AND EVER-CHANGING IDIOSYNCRACIES"", WOULD BE A NEW DEPARTURE FOR SOUTHERN AFRICA AND, INDEED, FOR MUCH OF AFRICA HE SAID. HE HOPED IT WOULD HELP ALLAY FEARS OF MINORITY GROUPS, ""ESPECIALLY THE WHITE MINORITY"", AND PROMISED TO DO ALL IN HIS POWER TO BRING IT ABOUT.\n3. REMAINDER OF CONGRESS WAS DEVOTED TO PASSAGE OF NUMEROUS RATHER ROUTINE RESOLUTIONS. THEY REFLECTED NO CHANGES IN PARTY POLICY. AS EXPECTED, COLIN EGLIN WAS RELECTED PARTY LEADER, AND RAY SWART WAS PROMOTED TO NATIONAL CHAIRMAN TO SUCCEED LATE HARRY LAWRENCE.\n4. COMMENT: IT WAS EVIDENT NEITHER PROGRESSIVE PARTY NOR FOUR HOMELAND SPEAKERS WERE IN ANY WAY COWED BY PRIME MINISTERS BLUNT WARNING IN HIS AUGUST 24 PRESS CONFERENCE (REFTEL). BLACK SPEAKERS PULLED NO PUNCHES IN THEIR ADDRESSES, WHICH WERE ENTHUSIASTICALLY APPLAUDED BY OVER 300 DELEGATES. ALTHOUGH PARTY SEEMED PLEAUED IN HAVING TAKEN PLUNGE AND SPONSORED OPEN MULTI-RACIAL MEETING FOR FIRST TIME IN MANY YEARS, SPEAKER AFTER SPEAKER MADE CLEAR THAT REASON WAS URGENT NEED FOR LIMITED OFFICIAL USE\n",1359896

BACKGROUND AND JUSTIFICATION FOR DECISION CONTAINED IN GOI PUBLISHED STATEMENT AS FOLLOWS: (UNNECESSARY WORDS OMITTED) QUOTE: GOVERNMENT HAD UNDER EXAMINATION FOR SOME TIME UNCLASSIFIED TAXATION ARRANGEMENTS IN RELATION TO MINING OF NON-BEDDED MIN- ERALS (COPPER, LEAD, ZINC, PYRITES, AND BARYTES) IN THIS COUNTRY. IT DECIDED THAT 20-YEAR TAX EXEMPTION INTRODUCED IN 1967 ON MINING PROFITS SHOULD BE WITHDRAWN AND BE REPLACED BY ALTERNATIVE SYSTEM OF TAXATION ALLOWANCES. NEW SYSTEM WILL APPLY TO, MINING ENTERPRISES ALREADY IN PRODUCTION AS WELL AS TO THOSE WHICH MAY GO INTO PRODUCTION IN FUTURE. MINISTER FOR FINANCE ARRANGING INTRODUCE LEGISLATION TO GIVE EFFECT TO GOVERNMENT DECISION. GOVERNMENT IS SATISFIED THAT TOTAL EXEMPTION FROM TAX OVER 20 YEARS IS UNDULY GENEROUS BY REFERENCE TO COMPARABLE CONCESSIONS IN OTHER COUNTRIES AND IS NO LONGER APPROPRIATE IN LIGHT OF POSITION NOW REACHED BY MINING INDUSTRY HERE. IF EXEMPTION WERE CONTINUED IT WOULD RESULT IN AN UNJUSTIFIABLY LA- RGE LOSS OF REVENUE TO THE STATE. GOVERNMENT ALSO CONSIDERS THAT OUR MINING INDUSTRY, HAVEING REACHED ITS PRESENT STATE OF DEVEL- OPMENT SHOULD NOW MAKE SUITABLE AND EQUITABLE TAX CONTRIBUTION TOWARDS EVER INCREASING COST OF PROMOTING NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT. NEW TAX PROVISIONS WILL PROVIDE THAT PROFITS FROM MINING OF NON- BEDDED MINERALS WILL BE LIABLE TO NORMAL RATES OF TAX (50 PER- CENT) AFTER DEDUCTING CERTAIN ALLOWANCES RE PROSPECTING, EXPLORATION, DEVELOPMENT AND NEW PLANT AND MACHINERY. FURTHER RE- LIEF BY WAY OF TAX ABATEMENT WILL BE PROVIDED MARGINAL MINES TO ENSURE THEY CAN BE WORKED ECONOMICALLY. GOVERNMENT IS CONFIDENT THAT THE MINING INDUSTRY WILL UNDERSTAND AND ACCEPT REVISION OF THE TAXATION ARRANGEMENTS JUSTIFIED AT THIS STAGE. IT IS WIDELY RECOGNISED THAT TAX EXEMPTION WAS NOT MAIN FACTOR IN GROWTH OF IRISH MINING INDUSTRY IN RECENT YEARS THE DEVELOPMENT WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO RELAT- IVELY FAVOURABLE AND WELL DOCUMENTED GEOLOGY, IMPROVEMENTS IN TECHNOLOGY, GOOD MINERAL LEGISLATION AND IMPETUS GIVEN BY TYNAGH DISCOVERY IN 1961. ALTERNATIVE TAX SYSTEM ENVISAGED WILL BE SPECIALLY DESIGNED TO MEET NEEDS OF THE IRISH MINING INDUSTRY AND WILL BE GENERALLY COMPARABLE WITH MINING TAXATION SYSTEMS IN OTHER COUNTRIES.

IT WAS NOT -- REPEAT, NOT -- IN OPERATION BEFORE THE COUP STARTED, FOR THE SIMPLE REASON THAT WE DID NOT KNOW THAT A COUP WOULD IN FACT TAKE PLACE.   SECONDLY, I THINK THOSE OF YOU WHO ARE FAMILIAR WITH STATE DEPARTMENT PRACTICES AND PROCEDURES WILL NOT BE SURPRISED TO LEARN THAT IT IS STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE TO ESTABLISH A TASK FORCE IN CIRCUMSTANCES OF THIS KIND. WE DO IT FREQUENTLY, AND HAVE AN OPERATIONS CENTER FOR THAT PURPOSE.   Q:  CONTINUE.   A:  FOURTHLY, WITH RESPECT TO AMBASSADOR DAVIS AND HIS LIMITED OFFICIAL USE   LIMITED OFFICIAL USE  RETURN HERE TO WASHINGTON, AND THE INTERPRETATIONS WHICH ARE BEING MADE WITH RESPECT TO HIS RETURN TO WASHINGTON -- I TOLD YOU LAST WEEK THAT WE ANTICIPATED HIS RETURN HERE, AND THAT AMBASSADOR DAVIS WAS AMONG MANY AMBASSADORS FROM ALL OVER THE WORLD, WHO WERE ASKED BY THE SECRETARY DESIG- NATE TO RETURN TO SAN CLEMENTE, OR TO WASHINGTON, TO SEE HIM.   BEFORE LEAVING CHILE, AMBASSADOR DAVIS TOLD THE CHILEAN FOREIGN OFFICE HE WAS GOING TO WASHINGTON FOR CONSULTATION AND THE EMBASSY HERE KNEW THAT HE WAS IN WASHINGTON.   AMBASSADOR DAVIS ARRIVED LAST FRIDAY, HAD CONSULTATIONS IN THE DEPARTMENT, SAW DR. KISSINGER, AND RETURNED TO SANTIAGO ON SATURDAY.  HE WAS, IN FACT, ASKED BY THE SECRETARY DESIGNATE TO COME TO WASHINGTON AT A TIME OF HIS CONVEN- IENCE, SOME DAYS AGO, AND HIS PURPOSE IN COMING WAS CLEARLY NOT TO REPORT ON ANY COUP ATTEMPT.   HE RETURNED TO CHILE IMMEDIATELY AFTER SEEING THE SECRETARY DESIGNATE, BECAUSE OF THE TENSE SITUATION THERE AND THE ADVISABILITY OF HAVING OUR AMBASSADOR PRESENT IN THE COUNTRY DURING THIS PERIOD -- WHICH IS, AGAIN, I REPEAT, A NORMAL PRACTICE OF OURS.  HE DID NOT RETURN BECAUSE WE KNEW A COUP WAS GOING TO TAKE PLACE.   FINALLY, WITH RESPECT TO THE DEATH OF PRESIDENT ALLENDE,   WHICH WAS ANNOUNCED I BELIEVE YESTERDAY AFTERNOON, I WANT TO MAKE THIS COMMENT:  I DO WANT TO EXPRESS REGRET ON THE LOSS OF LIFE IN CHILE AND PRACTICULARLY THAT OF THE CHIEF OF STATE, PRESIDENT ALLENDE.   Q:  PAUL --   A:  YES.   Q:  CAN YOU COMMENT ON THE REPORT THAT THE SENATORS WERE TOLD YESTERDAY THAT A DECISION WAS TAKEN ""AT THE HIGHEST LEVEL"" TO KEEP HANDS OFF?   LIMITED OFFICIAL USE   LIMITED OFFICIAL USE  A:  IM GOING TO TO ON BACKGROUND IN RESPONSE TO THAT QUESTION, BECAUSE WE DID HAVE AN OFFICER OF THIS BUILDING WHO DID GO TO SEE REPRESENTATIVES OF THE SENATE FOREIGN RELATIONS COMMITTEE, YESTERDAY AFTERNOON -- LATE IN THE AFTERNOON.   I HAVE SPOKEN WITH MR. KUBISCH IN THE COURSE OF THIS MORNING, ABOUT HIS DISCUSSION WITH THE SENATORS AND HE ASSURES ME THAT THAT PARTICULAR VERSION, OR THAT PARTICULAR INTERPRETATION, WAS NOT THE CASE, BECAUSE AS I SAID, WE DID NOT KNOW THAT THE COUP WAS GOING TO TAKE PLACE; AND ITS RATHER DIFFICULT TO MAKE A POLICY DECISION IN A STATE OF IGNORANCE.   Q:  WELL LET ME CARRY IT A LITTLE FURTHER.  YOU SAID, ""THERE WERE A NUMBER OF REPORTS OVER THE PREVIOUS DAYS.""   A:  IN PREVIOUS WEEKS -- AND MONTHS.   Q:  -- IT IS POSSIBLE THAT SOMETHING MR. KUBISCH SAID WAS MISCONSTRUED, BUT THAT A POLICY DECISION HAD BEEN MADE THAT IF ANY OF THESE THINGS ACTUALLY DO COME OFF, THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT WILL STAY OUT OF IT -- AND THAT THAT DECISION WAS TAKEN AT THE HIGHEST LEVEL?   I MEAN, IT SEEMS A LITTLE DIFFICULT TO BELIEVE THAT A NUMBER OF SENATORS WERE TOTALLY UNABLE TO COMPREHEND WHAT WAS SAID.   A:  AGAIN, I WANT TO TALK ON BACKGROUND BECAUSE THE MEET- ING WAS IN EXECUTIVE SESSION, AND I HOPE YOU WILL EXCUSE ME.   THE WAY I READ THE STORY, IT SAID THAT -- AS I RECALL IT -- THAT WE KNEW IN ADVANCE OF THE COUP, THAT THE COUP WAS GOING TO TAKE PLACE, WE KNEW THE DAY BEFORE AND BECAUSE OF THAT KNOWLEDGE THAT WE HAD ACQUIRED, WE MADE A DECISION BASED ON THAT INFORMATION TO HAVE A ""HANDS OFF"" POLICY. THAT WAS THE THRUST OF THE STORY IF I RECOLLECT IT.   AND ALL I CAN SAY REALLY IS THAT THIS COULDNT HAVE LIMITED OFFICIAL USE   LIMITED OFFICIAL USE  HAPPENED.   Q:  PAUL I WANT TO SETTLE A POINT HERE.  WHEN YOU SAY, AND YOU HAVE SAID SEVERAL TIMES, THAT YOU WERE TOLD THE COUP WAS COMING AND THAT THERE WAS NO WAY TO PROVE IT -- ITS OBVIOUS -- YOU NEVER KNOW WHEN THE COUP WILL TAKE PLACE.   NOW THE QUESTION IS:   NUMBER ONE:  WHO INFORMED THE UNITED STATES OF THE LAST REPORT THE COUP WAS COMING ON SEPTEMBER THE 11TH?  WAS IT AN OFFICER WHO IS NOW A MEMBER OF THE CHILEAN GOVERNMENT? WAS IT A MEMBER OF THE CHILEAN CONGRESS, OR WAS IT THE NEWSBOY ON THE STREET?   AND NUMBER TWO:  IF THE UNITED STATES GOT SO MANY REPORTS THAT THE COUP WAS COMING -- AT ANY TIME DID IT ATTEMPT TO TELL THE MILITARY NOT TO OVERTHROW THE LEGAL GOVERNMENT OF CHILE?   A:  WITH RESPECT TO YOUR FIRST QUESTION:  I SHOULD POINT OUT THAT OUR EMBASSIES OVERSEAS HAVE AS ONE OF THEIR RESPONSIBILITIES, THEIR FUNCTIONS, TO REPORT ON DEVELOP- MENTS IN THEIR COUNTRY -- THE COUNTRY TO WHICH THEY ARE ATTACHED.   AS I SAID, WE HAD RECEIVED A VARIETY OF REPORTS FROM A VARIETY OF SOURCES ON DEVELOPMENTS IN THAT COUNTRY.  IM NOT ABOUT TO DSICLOSE AND REVEAL SOURCES.   I THINK ITS SUFFICIENT TO SAY THAT THE REPORTS WERE CERTAINLY OF SUFFICIENT STANDING, IN THE VIEW OF THE EMBASSY, THAT THEY SAW FIT TO TRANSMIT IT TO WASHINGTON. BUT BEYOND THAT, I WOULDNT HAVE ANY FURTHER COMMENT.   Q:  COULD I JUST ASK THE QUESTION A DIFFERENT WAY.   YOU CHARACTERIZE SOME OF THE EARLIER REPORTS AS ""COMMON GOSSIP IN SANTIAGO, KNOWN TO A GREAT MANY PEOPLE.""  WAS THAT ALSO TRUE OF THE REPORT DEALING WITH SEPTEMBER 11TH? WOULD YOU CARE TO CHARACTERIZE THAT ONE THE SAME WAY? LIMITED OFFICIAL USE   LIMITED OFFICIAL USE  A:  I WOULD CHARACTERIZE IT PRECISELY THE WAY I JUST DID, AND IT WAS OF SUFFICIENT STANDING IN THE EYES OF THE EMBASSY, THAT THEY SAW FIT TO TRANSMIT IT TO WASHINGTON.   Q. COULD YOU ANSWER THE QUESTION WHETHER YOU MADE ANY ATTEMPT TO TELL THE MILITARY NOT TO OVERTHROW THE LEGALLY   A:  I WILL HAVE TO GO ON BACKGROUND BECAUSE I WOULD HAVE TO CHECK IT OUT THOROUGHLY, TO BE SURE OF MY GROUNDS.  BUT I THINK IT WOULD HAVE BEEN OUR POSTURE NOT TO INVOLVE OURSELVES.   WE SAID THAT WE WERE NOT INVOLVED IN THIS, VERY CLEARLY, YESTERDAY AND, ITS BEEN OUR POLICY NOT TO INTERFERE IN THE INTERNAL AFFAIRS OF ANOTHER COUNTRY.   Q:  NO, NO, NO, NO, I AM NOT REFERRING TO THAT.  I AM REFERRING TO WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF COOPERATION WITH THE LATIN AMERICAN COUNTRY -- THE CONSTANT CONSULTATION OF PROBLEMS OF COMMON INTEREST, AND THIS WOULD INCLUDE THE PROBLEM OF THE COMMUNITY, AND THE PROBLEM OF CONCERN. THE OVERTHROW OF THE GOVERNMENT OF THE COMMUNITY IS A PROBLEM OF CONCERN.  I DONT SUGGEST TO INTERFERE BUT JUST TWO OR THREE DAYS WITH THE MILITARY WOULD BLOCK THE NATION, THAT THE UNITED WOULD OVERLOOK -- ABROGATE THE OVERTHROW OF THE LEGAL GOVERNMENT.   A:  ILL TAKE YOUR QUESTION.   Q:  PAUL, ALONG THE SIMILAR LINES, DID THE GOVERNMENT OF THE UNITED STATES PASS ON TO THE THEN CHILEAN GOVERNMENT ANY OF THE REPORTS WHICH YOU HAVE REFERRED TO?  IN OTHER WORDS,WAS THERE ANY ATTEMPT MADE TO WARN PRESIDENT ALLENDE THAT WE WERE HEARING ABOUT COUPS -- OR GETTING THIS COUP INFORMATION --   A:  ON BACKGROUND, JIM, I DOUBT IF THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN NECESSARY.  BUT CERTAINLY WITH RESPECT TO THE LATTER REPORTS, WHICH I HAVE DISCUSSED, THEY WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN TRANSMITTED SIMPLY BECAUSE THEY WERE READ HERE BY LIMITED OFFICIAL USE   LIMITED OFFICIAL USE  RESPONSIBLE OFFICIALS -- AFTER THE FACT.   Q:  WELL WHAT ABOUT THE EARLIER REPORTS, THE OTHER REPORTS -- WERE THOSE PASSED ON?   A:  ON BACKGROUND, I WOULD DOUBT IT.   Q:  . . . SO YOU ARE SAYING IT WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN NECESSARY.  BUT WHY WOULDNT IT HAVE BEEN NECESSARY?\n",1357983

SPECIFICALLY, EMBASSY WILL ENCOURAGE GSL TO UNDERTAKE THESE MEASURES:\n5. PRINCIPAL PROJECTS UNDERTAKEN:\n6. EMBASSY EVALUATION: PROGRESS CONTINUES SLOW, ALTHOUGH ESTABLISHMENT OF POLICE NARCOTICS DIVISON HAS BROUGHT SOME NEEDED FOCUS TO GSL NARCOTICS CONTROL EFFORTS. ESTAB- LISHMENT SEPT 13 OF NATIONAL NARCOTICS ADVISORY BOARD SHOULD EVENTUALLY MAKE SIGNIFICANT CONTRIBUTION. RATIFICATION OF AMENDMENTS TO SINGLE CONVENTION WOULD BE CONCRETE INDICATION OF STRENGTHENED GSL ATTITUDE TOWARD NARCOTICS, BUT RELATIVELY LOW PRIORITY OF NARCOTICS CONTROL PROGRAM HERE SUGGESTS THAT ACTION WIL NOT BE TAKEN QUICKLY. HAVING OTHER URGENT PROBLEMS, GSL HAS BEEN WILLING TO LIVE WITH NARCOTICS PROBLEM IN SRI LANKA AS IT HAS BEEN PERCEIVIED, THAT IS, LARGE AMOUNT OF TRADITIONAL USAGE OF GANJA, SMALL LOCAL CONSUMPTION OF OPIUM, AND UNKNOWN QUANTITY OF OPIUM TRANS-SHIPPED THROUGH SRI LANKA INTO INTERNATIONAL TRAFFIC. LONG-AWAITED CREATION OF INTER-AGENCY COORDINATING BOARD IS, HOWEVER, SIGN OF GROWING AWARENESS OF NEED TO MOBILIZE ALL RESOURCES IN NARCOTICS EFFORT AND IS HOPEFUL DEVELOPMENT. IF IT WERE DEFINITELY ESTABLISHED THAT LARGE QUANTITIES OF OPIUM WERE BEING SMUGGLED THROUGH SRI LANKA AND ROUTES AND NAMES OF TRAFFICKERS WERE IDENTIFIED, GSL WOULD PROBABLY RESPOND WITH COMPARATIVE VIGOR, WITHIN LIMITES ITS RESOURCES, TO SUPPRESS THIS TRAFFIC.\n7. COUNTRY TEAM RECOMMENDATION: INTELLIGENCE-GATHERING EFFORTS SHOULD CONTINUE TO SEEK TO DETERMINE MAGNITUDE AND ROUTES OF OPIUM SMUGGLING THROUGH SRI LANKA. IN COOPERATION WITH INTERNATIONAL ADVISORY AGENCIES (INCLUDING COLOMBO PLAN AND UN), WE SHOULD ENCOURAGE GSL TO CONFIDENTIAL  STRENGTHEN NARCOTICS LAWS. WORKING-LEVEL CONTACTS BETWEEN EMBASSY OFFICIALS, DEA PERSONNEL, AND GSL POLICE NARTICS CONTROL OFFICERS SHOULD BE CONTINUED. EMBASSY RECOMMENDS HIGH GSL POLICE OFFICIALS BE INVITED TO VISIT UNITED STATES FOR NARCOTICS BRIEFINGS AND CONSULTATIONS, AND THAT KEY OFFICIALS ON NARCOTICS ENFORCEMENT BE GIVEN RELEVANT TRAINING IN UNITED STATES. AS GSL STRENGTHENS ADMINISTRATIVE BASE FOR NARCOTICS CONTROL EFFORTS AND NARCOTICS PROBLEM BECOMES CLEARER, USG MAY WISH SPONSOR TRAINING PROGRAMS FOR GREATER NUMBERS OF GSL NARCOTICS ENFORCEMENT STAFF, PERHAPS IN FORM OF VISIT TO DEA TRAINING TEAM TO SRI LANKA.

BEGIN SUMMARY: REPRESENTATIVES FROM EMBASSIES BANGKOK, RANGOON, TAIPEI, VIENTIANE, CONGEN HONG KONG, CONSULATE CHIANG MAI, AND CINCPAC MET IN BANGKOK AND CHIANG MAI SEPT 18-20. TOPICS DISCUSSED INCLUDED THE CURRENT NARCOTICS SCENE IN BURMA, LAOS, THAILAND AND HONG KONG, TRAWLERS, ACETIC ANHYDRIDE, CARAVANS, GUNS- FOR-NARCOTICS, INCOME SUBSTITUTION, AND REGIONAL CO- OPERATION. THE PARTICIPANTS AGREED ON A NUMBER OF RECOMMENDATIONS (PARA 14). END SUMMARY.\n2. EMBASSIES RANGOON AND VIENTIANE AND CONGEN HONG KONG CONCUR IN THIS REPORT.\n3. ATMOSPHERICS. EMB BANGKOK HOSTED THE THIRD TRI-COUNTRY (BURMA, LAOS, THAILAND) NARCOTICS MEETING SEPT. 18-20. AMCONSUL HONG KONG PARTICIPATED FOR THE FIRST TIME. REPRE- SENTATIVES FROM EMB TAIPEI AND CINCPAC TOOK ADVANTAGE OF THEIR PRESENCE IN THAILAND ON OTHER BUSINESS TO PARTICIPATE ALSO. AFTER DISCUSSIONS IN BANGKOK SEPT. 18 AND 19, THE PARTICIPANTS FLEW TO CHIANG MAI. HEAVY RAINS FORCED CANCEL- LATION OF THE PLANNED VISIT TO THE UN EXPERIMENTAL STATION AT CHANG KHIAN SEPTEMBER 20, BUT PARTICIPANTS MET WITH REPRE- SENTATIVES FROM THE UN PROJECT, US DEPT. OF AGRICULTURE, AND THE RTG DEPT OF PUBLIC WELFARE HILLTRIBE RESEARCH CENTER IN CHIANG MAI. THE CONFEREES ALSO VISITED THE THAI POLICE NARCOTICS SUP- PRESSION CENTER IN BANGKOK AND THE HEADQUARTERS OF THE SPECIAL NARCOTICS ORGANIZATION (SNO) IN CHIANG MAI.\n4. THAILAND.\n5. BURMA. GUB PROGRESS AGAINST NARCOTICS TRAFFICKERS SINCE THE LAST TRI-COUNTRY MEETING IN APRIL 1973 IS UN- PRECEDENTED, WITH THE GUB, ALTHOUGH STILL FIRMLY INDE- PENDENT AND NON-ALIGNED, NOW STRONGLY MOTIVATED AND TAKING ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS. THE GUB CRACKDOWN ON THE KHA KWE YEI (KKY) IN APRIL RESULTED IN THE CAPTURE OF LO HSING MINH, YOUNGER BROTHER OF LO SHING-HAN AND OTHER IMPORTANT TRAF- FICKERS, BEFORE THE LATTERS CAPTURE IN THAILAND IN JULY. GUB-RTG COOPERATION WILL HOPEFULLY BE MAINTAINED AND IN- CREASED, PARTICULARLY IN VIEW OF U NUS DEPARTURE FROM THAILAND.  GUB MILITARY INTELLIGENCE GROUPS SENT DIRECTLY FROM RANGOON HAVE MADE SECRET RAIDS AGAINST SMUGGLERS IN THE SHAN STATES, AVOIDING TIP-OFFS TO TRAFFICKERS FROM CORRUPT LOW-LEVEL LOCAL OFFICIALS. INFORMATION THAT THE USG PRO- VIDED TO THE GUB HAS PLAYED AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN THESE SUC- CESSES. THE GUB IS NOW WORKING OUT PLANS FOR A $5 MILLION, FIVE-YEAR PROJECT WITH UNFDAC. SINCE THE HEROIN PROBLEM HAS NOW REACHED THE MAJORITY ETHNIC BURMESE AND THE SONS OF THE RULING ELITE, THE BURMESE PRESS IS GIVING INCREASINGLY WIDE COVERAGE TO STORIES OF NARCOTICS SEIZURES AND PENALTIES, IS WARNING THE POPULACE OF THE HEROIN MENACE, AND IS REPORT- ING ON REHABILITATION MEASURES. INCREASED FIGHTING BETWEEN THE BURMESE ARMY AND DISSIDENTS, WHO ARE ALSO BEING SQUEEZED BY THE BURMA COMMUNIST PARTY (WHITE FLAG) ADVANCING FORCES, AND INCREASED ENFORCEMENT ACTIVITIES IN TRAFFICKING AREAS HAS RESULTED IN THE PROBABILITY THAT MORE DRUGS MAY IN THE FUTURE COME DOWN THROUGH BURMA TO RANGOON AND INTO INTERNATIONAL MARKETS, OR THROUGH INDIA AND POSSIBLY BANG-    SECRET\n6. LAOS. THE DRUG SITUATION IN LAOS HAS NOT CHANGED SIG- NIFICANTLY SINCE THE LAST TRI-COUNTRY MEETING, BUT THERE HAVE BEEN DRAMATIC CHANGES ON THE POLITICAL FRONT. THE FORMATION OF A NEW COALITION GOVT IS NOT EXPECTED TO DIS- TURB NARCOTICS ENFORCEMENT ACTIVITIES, SINCE THE GROUPE SPECIAL DINVESTIGATION WILL CONTINUE TO OPERATE OUT OF THE PRIMINS OFFICE. HOWEVER, WE DO NOT BELIEVE THE PATHET LAO WILL WANT U.S. ENFORCEMENT PERSONNEL TO OPERATE UP-COUNTRY AS FREELY AS THEY HAVE IN THE PAST OR TO OPERATE AT ALL IN THEIR ZONE OF TEMPORARY POLITICAL CONTROL, EVEN THOUGH PL PUBLIC STATEMENTS HAVE GENERALLY OPPOSED NARCOTICS USAGE. THE WAR IN LAOS, COMBINED WITH INTENSIFIED RLG-USG ENFORCEMENT EF- FORTS, HAS REDUCED OPIUM PRODUCTION IN LAOS FROM AN ESTIMATED\n0. AT THE SAME TIME, RE-ESTABLISHMENT    SECRET\n7. HONG KONG. SINCE THE CITY WAS HISTORICALLY FOUNDED AS AN OUTLET FOR THE OPIUM TRADE, OPIUM LONG MET OFFICIAL TOLERANCE. AS HEROIN HAS REPLACED OPIUM AS A MAJOR DRUG IN HONG KONG, AUTHORITIES THERE HAVE BECOME INCREASINGLY CONCERNED WITH THE DRUG PROBLEM, HOWEVER. HONG KONG HAS INCREASED THE NUMBER OF POLICE WORKING ON NARCOTICS AND THEY ARE TRYING TO DISRUPT DISTRIBUTION OUTLETS. HONG KONG POLICE BELIEVE THAT ONE THAI TRAWLER ARRIVED IN NEARBY WATERS DURING EARLY SEPTEMBER, THE FIRST ONE SINCE EARLY JUNE. ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS IN SOUTHEAST ASIA HAVE CAUSED A SERIOUS SHORTAGE OF DRUGS IN HONG KONG RESULTING IN A 300 PER CENT IN- CREASE IN STREET PRICES AND A DOUBWING OF WHOLESALE PRICES IN THREE MONTHS. ALTHOUGH HONG KONG IS OFTEN ACCUSED OF BEING A JAMOR TRANSSHIPMENT POINT OF NARCOTICS TO THE US, AMCONSULATE HONG KONG HAS NO SUBSTANTIAL EVIDENCE THAT THIS IS SO. HONG KONG AUTHORITIES NEED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND EQUIPMENT FOR A MAJOR ENFORCEMENT EFFORT AGAINST SOME 30-40 SMALL HEROIN LABORATORIES.\n8. TRAWLER TRAFFIC. THERE ARE AN ESTIMATED 2000 THAI TRAWLERS LARGE ENOUGH TO SAIL TO HONG KONG. THE FINANCIER GENERALLY PUTS TOGETHER A MIXED LOAD OF OPIUM, MORPHINE, AND HEROIN AND ARRANGES WITH A TRAWLER CAPTAIN TO CARRY IT TO HONG KONG WHERE THE NARCOTICS ARE UNLOADED OUTSIDE HONG KONG TERRITORIAL WATERS. INCREASED ENFORCEMENT ACTION HAS CAUSED TRAWLER CREWS TO ASK FOR PAYMENT IN ADVANCE.    SECRET\n9. ACETIC ANHYDRIDE. DEA BANGKOK PREPARED AND DISTRIBUTED TO CONFERENCE PARTICIPANTS A DETAILED REPORT ON ACETIC ANHYDRIDE AMONG SOUTHEAST ASIAN NATIONS. ONLY THAILAND AND LAOS HAVE CONTROLS ON THE IMPORT OF ACETIC ANHYDRIDE, BUT THESE DO NOT INCLUDE CONTROL AFTER THE CHEMICAL HAS PASSED THROUGH CUSTOMS. MAJOR SUPPLIERS OF ACETIC ANHYDRIDE SUCH AS JAPAN AND THE U.S. HAVE NO CONTROLS ON EXPORTS. BECAUSE OF THE LARGE AMOUNT OF ACETIC ANHYDRIDE TRADED INTERNATIONALLY FBR LEGITIMATE PURPOSES AND THE SMALL AMOUNT NEEDED FOR HEROIN PRODUCTION IN THE GOLDEN TRIANGLE, THE CONFEREES SAW LITTLE PROSPECT FOR CONTROLLING SHIPMENTS OF ACETIC ANHYDRIDE TO SOUTHEAST ASIA. SNO WILL INTENSIFY ITS EFFORTS THROUGH INFORMANTS AND ROADBLOCKS TO BE ON THE LOOKOUT FOR ACETIC ANHYDRIDE SINCE THERE IS NO LEGITIMATE USE FOR THIS CHEMICAL IN NORTHERN THAILAND. LAO AND U.S. ENFORCEMENT/INTELLIGENCE ORGANIZATIONS WILL CONTINUE TO MONITOR SHIPMENTS OF ACETIC ANHYDRIDE AND OTHER CHEMICALS TO UP-COUNTRY LOCATIONS IN LAOS WHERE NO LEGITIMATE INDUSTRIAL OR COMMERICAL DEMAND FOR THE CHEMICAL EXISTS.\n0. CARAVANS. THE BORDER AREA BETWEEN NORTHERN THAILAND AND EASTERN BURMA IS FREQUENTLY TRANSITED BY CARAVANS MOVING A WIDE VARIETY OF MERCHANDISE ACROSS THE THAI/BURMA BORDER; BEEF, ACIMAL HIDES, TEAK LOGS, ORE, JADE, AND NARCOTICS TO THAILAND; AND ARMS, AMMUNITION, AND CONSUMER GOODS TO BURMA. THE RTG CONSIDERS THIS COMMERCE BENEFICIAL EXCEPT FOR THE NARCOTICS. SINCE JUNE 1973 THAI POLICE HAVE ATTEMPTED TO SEIZE CARAVANS SUSPECTED OF CARRYING NARCOTICS. AS RTG ENFORCEMENT AGAINST NARCOTICS CARAVANS INCREASES,    SECRET\n2. INCOME SUBSTITUTION. CONFERENCE PARTICIPANTS HEARD BRIEFINGS IN CHIANG MAI BY RICHARD MANN, PROJECT MANAGER OF THE UN CROP SUBSTITUTION PROJECT IN THAILAND; DR. WALLACE MANISAN DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE; AND GARY OUGHTEN OF THE RTG DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC WELFARE HILLTRIBE RESEARCH CENTER. ONE MAJOR PROBLEM IS HOW TO CONTINUE THE UN CROP SUBSTITU- TION WORK AFTER THE UN FIVE-YEAR CONTRACT EXPIRES, SINCE THERE IS NO DIRECT RTG PARTICIPATION IN THE PROJECT. ANOTHER NEED IS TO MOVE BEYOND SIMPLE CROP SUBSTITUTION TO OTHER FORMS OF INCOME SUBSTITUTION AND AN INTEGRATED DEVELOPMENT OF THE HILLTRIBE AREAS. IT IS ALSO IMPORTANT TO GET THE PRIVATE SECTOR INVOLVED, ESPECIALLY IN MARKETING HILLTRIBE PRODUCTS. EXISTING ROADS AND TRAILS IN THE HILL- TRIBE AREAS SHOULD BE IMPROVED SO THEY CAN BE USED IN THE    SECRET     WET SEASON. A COMPREHENSIVE REFORESTATION SCHEME INCLUDING A LAND USE PLAN IS NEEDED SINCE THE HIGHLAND AREAS ARE NATURALLY SUITED TO FORESTS RATHER THAN AGRICULTURE.\n3. NEXT MEETING. THE NEXT TRI-COUNTRY MEETING SHOULD BE HELD DURING A SINGLE DAY IN MANILA OR SINGAPORE EITHER IMMEDIATELY BEFORE OR AFTER THE EA-WIDE CONFERENCE IN LATE JANUARY.\n4. RECOMMENDATIONS ON HOW THE US CAN SUPPORT ANTI-NARCOTICS EFFORTS AND FOSTER REGIONAL COOPERATION AMONG SOUTHEAST ASIAN GOVERNMENTS.\n",1370638

BEGIN UNCLASSIFIED PRESS GUIDANCE (SHORT VERSION)        1.  CONGRESSMAN WOLFF REPORTED THIS OFFER TO OUR EMBASSY IN BANGKOK WHEN HE WAS THERE IN AUGUST AND THE MATTER WAS DISCUSSED WITH HIM.        2.  WE DO NOT CONSIDER THE PROPOSAL FEASIBLE BECAUSE:         -- THE PEOPLE INVOLVED ARE UNTRUSTWORTHY AND DO NOT HAVE ENOUGH POWER TO DELIVER ON THEIR PROMISE.  ONE OF THEM IS IN A RANGOON JAIL AWAITING TRIAL FOR NARCOTICS AND OTHER CRIMES.          -- THE PROPOSAL WOULD INVOLVE SUPPORTING A REBELLION AGAINST A FRIENDLY SOVEREIGN GOVERNMENT.  INTERNATIONAL RAMIFICATIONS WOULD BE ENORMOUS.          -- THE PROPOSAL WOULD END GROWING COOPERATION BE- TWEEN THE US AND BURMA ON NARCOTICS AND WOULD DISRUPT BURMESE EFFORTS TO SUPPRESS NARCOTICS TRAFFICKING GROUPS. (SEE NEW YORK TIMES ARTICLE, SEPTEMBER 13, PAGE 7 ON INTENSIFYING BURMESE ANTI-NARCOTICS EFFORTS).  WE BELIEVE OUR ANTI-NARCOTICS OBJECTIVES CAN BEST BE ACHIEVED BY WORKING THROUGH LEGITIMATE AUTHORITIES IN THE AREAS CON- CERNED AND THAT OUR EFFORTS BY THIS MEANS ARE SHOWING INCREASING EFFECTIVENESS.  \n4.  PRESS GUIDANCE (EXPANDED VERSION)       1.  CONGRESSMAN WOLFF REPORTED THIS OFFER TO OUR EMBASSY IN BANGKOK WHEN HE WAS THERE IN AUGUST.       2.  IN DISCUSSION WITH THE EMBASSY IT WAS EXPLAINED TO HIM THAT:          -- THIS IS ONE OF A NUMBER OF SIMILAR PROPOSALS MADE TO AMERICAN AUTHORITIES BY PERSONS REPRESENTING THEMSELVES AS CHANNELS TO VARIOUS DISSIDENT GROUPS IN NORTHERN BURMA.   LIMITED OFFICIAL USE   LIMITED OFFICIAL USE         -- THE PEOPLE INVOLVED HAVE BEEN JUDGED TO BE CON MEN, DISREPUTABLE BROKERS, AND GENERALLY UNRELIABLE PEOPLE WHO COULD NOT DELIVER ON THEIR PROMISES.          -- THERE ARE SERIOUS OBJECTIONS TO THE PRINCIPLE OF PREEMPTIVE OPIUM BUYING IN THE CIRCUMSTANCES PREVAILING IN THE GOLDEN TRIANGLE.          -- CONSIDERATION OF THIS PROPOSAL AND ACCEPTANCE OF IT WOULD HAVE EXTREMELY SERIOUS POLITICAL CONSEQUENCES.          3.  PROBLEMS INVOLVED IN THIS PROPOSAL INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING:          -- IT IS DOUBTFUL THAT THE INDIVIDUALS WHO MADE THE OFFER ACTUALLY HAVE ENOUGH AUTHORITY IN THE SHAN STATE TO DELIVER THE OPIUM THEY DESCRIBE AND TO PREVENT FURTHER   PRODUCTION AND TRAFFICKING.  THIS IS A CHAOTIC AREA IN WHICH SEVERAL RIVAL INSURGENT GROUPS ARE VYING WITH EACH OTHER AND THE BURMESE AUTHORITIES FOR CONTROL.  A DEAL WITH THESE INDIVIDUALS WOULD BY NO MEANS BUY US CONTROL OF THE SHAN STATE AND ITS OPIUM PRODUCTION OR THE COOPERA- TION OF OTHER GROUPS ENGAGED IN THE LUCRATIVE NARCOTICS BUSINESS.          -- POLITICALLY THE PROPOSITION COULD BE DISASTROUS. THE OFFER INCLUDES A US PROMISE TO HELP THESE TWO INSURGENT GROUPS WIN FOR THE SHAN STATE AND THEMSELVES ""AUTONOMY FROM BURMA"".  THUS WE ARE ASKED TO SUPPORT THEM IN A REBELLION AND VIRTUALLY TO GO TO WAR AGAINST A FRIENDLY SOVEREIGN COUNTRY.  EVEN IF WE WERE PREPARED TO DISREGARD THE CONTEMPT FOR INTERNATIONAL LAW AND MORALITY THAT THIS WOULD IMPLY, WE COULD NOT DISREGARD THE FACT THAT IT COULD THREATEN TO INVOLVE US IN AN INSURGENCY SITUATION--AND IN AN AREA VERY CLOSE TO THE PRC BORDER.          -- ANY CONSIDERATION OF THIS OFFER WOULD IMMEDI- ATELY END COOPERATIVE RELATIONS ON NARCOTICS MATTERS WITH THE GUB, WHICH HAS DURING THE PAST YEAR INCREASED ITS COOPERATION WITH THE US AND THE UN ON NARCOTICS MATTERS LIMITED OFFICIAL USE   LIMITED OFFICIAL USE  AND INTENSIFIED ITS OWN EFFORTS TO SUPPRESS NARCOTICS TRAFFICKING BY SUCH GROUPS AS THOSE REPRESENTED BY THE PERSONS WHO APPROACHED CONGRESSMAN WOLFF.  IN THIS CON- NECTION, SEE NEW YORK TIMES ARTICLE OF SEPTEMBER 13, AT PAGE 7, BY BERNARD WEINRAUB.  NOTE ALSO THAT ONE OF THE SIGNERS OF THE DOCUMENT GIVEN TO WOLFF IS LO HSING-HAN (SPELLED ""LAW HSIN-HAN"" IN ANDERSON ARTICLE) WHO WAS APPREHENDED IN JULY BY THAI POLICE, TURNED OVER TO BURMESE AUTHORITIES AND NOW AWAITS TRIAL IN BURMA.          -- THE IDEA OF PREEMPTIVE BUYING OF NARCOTICS IN THIS AREA HAS BEEN CONSIDERED CAREFULLY AND REJECTED AS INFEASIBLE FOR VARIOUS REASONS.  AMONG THEM ARE THAT POTENTIAL SELLERS ARE, LIKE THE INDIVIDUALS INVOLVED IN THE OFFER TO WOLFF, NOT IN A POSITION TO CONTROL PRODUC- TION AND TRAFFICKING THROUGHOUT THE AREA AND THAT PRE- EMPTIVE BUYING WOULD HAVE THE EFFECT OF STIMULATING INCREASED PRODUCTION.  IT WOULD IN EFFECT ADD AN ADDI- TIONAL MARKET AND THUS INCREASE INCENTIVES.  THE SITUATION IN THE SHAN STATE IN THIS REGARD IS VASTLY DIFFERENT FROM THAT IN TURKEY IN THAT OPIUM GROWING AREAS IN TURKEY ARE UNDER EFFECTIVE TURKISH GOVERNMENT CONTROL.          -- WE CONTINUE TO BELIEVE THAT THE BEST AND THE ONLY FEASIBLE APPROACH TO THE NARCOTICS PROBLEM IN THE SHAN STATE IS THROUGH SUPPORTING BURMESE GOVERNMENT   SUPPRESSIVE EFFORTS AS BEST WE CAN, THROUGH THE INCREASED COOPERATION THAT IS DEVELOPING BETWEEN THAILAND AND BURMA ON CROSS BORDER NARCOTICS MOVEMENTS AND THROUGH SUPPORT OF THAI EFFORTS TO STEM THE FLOW OF SHAN STATE OPIUM THROUGH THAI TERRITORY.          -- THE GOLDEN TRIANGLE NARCOTICS PROBLEM IS SERIOUS (EVEN THOUGH A RELATIVELY SMALL PROPORTION OF US NARCOTICS COME FROM THAT AREA), BUT PROGRESS IS BEING MADE.  THE PROBLEM CAN ONLY BECOME WORSE IF WE ADOPT MEASURES THAT ADD TO THE CHAOS AND TURBULENCE IN THAT AREA WHICH HAS LONG PROVIDED  AN ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH NARCOTICS PRODUC- TION AND TRAFFICKING COULD FLOURISH.

DAUD IS VERY UNLIKELY TO PLAY DELIBERATELY INTO SOVIET HANDS                            WHILE UNDOUBTEDLY READY TO MILK THE RUSSIANS FOR ALL POSSIBLE ECONOMIC                            AND POLITICAL

             TRYTNG TO SEIZE POWER ON HIS OWN BUT WE BELIEVE THESE INITIAL TWO                            MONTHS HAVE HAD A SOBERING EFFECT ON YOUNG OFFICERS WHO ARE NOW

SUMMARY: CHARGES INITIAL CALL ON DEPPRIMIN SHARQ PRODUCED WHAT WE INTERPRET AS WELCOME MESSAGE FROM DAUD THAT GOA INTENDS DO ITS BEST MAINTAIN GOOD US-AFGHAN RELATIONS. REGARDING ABORTIVE COUP, SHARQ SAID GOA ABSOLUTELY CERTAIN THAT USG NOT RPT NOT INVOLVED; ONLY GOVERNMENT OF PAKISTAN WHICH WAS IN CONTACT WITH PLOTTERS. ALTHOUGH SOME PERSONS WERE ASSERTING US INVOLVEMENT, GOA HAD ORDERED A STOP TO SUCH RUMORS, DETERMINED PREVENT THOSE SEEKING TO DAMAGE US-AFGHAN RELATIONS FROM HAVING ANY SUCCESS. SHARQ SAID REGIME COMPLETELY SATISFIED WITH MANNER IN WHICH USMISSION AND ITS PERSONNEL HAD CONDUCTED SELVES SINCE JULY 17 COUP. US WOULD SOON SEE THAT ITS ""TRUE FRIENDS"" WERE ""REVOLUTIONARIES"" NOW IN POWER AND NOT ""CORRUPT    SECRET\n2. MY COURTESY CALL ON DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER HASAN SHARQ SEPTEMBER 27 EVOLVED FROM THE INITIAL AND SOMEWHAT BANAL DIPLOMATIC EXPRESSIONS OF US-AFGHAN FRIENDSHIP INTO A SIGNI- FICANT EXCHANGE ABOUT PREVALENT RUMORS CONCERNING ALLEGED US INVOLVEMENT IN THE ""PLOT"" RECENTLY UNCOVERED HERE AGAINST THE DAUD REGIME. INITIALLY STIFF AND FORMAL, THOUGH NOT UNFRIENDLY, DR. SHARQ (WHO SPOKE IN FARSI THROUGH A FOREIGN MINISTRY OFFICIAL ACTING AS INTERPRETER) WARMED PERCEPTABLY DURING OUR DISCUSSION. HE IS SOFT-SPOKEN AND APPEARED SOMNOLENT AT FIRST. HOWEVER, HE BECAME QUITE ANIMATED AS OUR MEETING CONTINUED AND SHOWED CONSIDERABLE FRIENDLY WARMTH TOWARD ITS CONCLUSION. WIDELY CONSIDERED BY DIPLOMATS HERE AS A LIGHT- WEIGHT, IMPORTANT ONLY AS A TRUSTED MOUTHPIECE FOR PRESIDENT DAUD, SHARQ STRUCK ME RATHER AS A WILY, INTELLIGENT MAN OPERATING ON A VERY SHORT LEASH.\n3. TO INITIATE CONVERSATION I ALLUDED TO THE LONG-STANDING US POLICY OF FRIENDSHIP AND SUPPORT FOR AFGHANISTAN WHICH DATES BACK WELL INTO PRESIDENT DAUDS PREVIOUS TENURE AS PRIME MINISTER. I STRESSED THAT WE HOPED TO CONTINUE THIS KIND OF FRIENDLY RELATIONSHIP, PROVIDING BOTH ECONOMIC ASSISTANCE AND POLITICAL ENCOURAGEMENT TO ASSIST AFGHANISTAN MAINTAIN ITS TRADITIONAL INDEPENDENCE AND NON-ALIGNED POSTURE IN THE REGION.\n4. SHARQ RESPONDED THAT THE ""REVOLUTIONARY GOVERNMENT"" SHARED FULLY THE HOPE THAT ITS RELATIONS WITH THE US WOULD REMAIN FRIENDLY AND COOPERATIVE, AND STRESSED THAT THIS WAS THE GOA INTENT. HE FIRST ALLUDED CAUTIOUSLY AND LATER MORE OPENLY TO THE FACT THAT ""THERE WERE INDIVIDUALS SEEKING TO CAUSE DIFFICULTY AND TO WORSEN US-AFGHAN RELATIONS."" HOWEVER, HE ASSURED MEON SEVERAL OCCASIONS DURING THE CONVERSATION THAT THESE UNNAMED ELEMENTS WOULD IN NO WAY SUCCEED IN DISTURBING US-AFGHAN TIES. WHEN I ACKNOWLEDGED THAT WE TOO KNEW THERE WERE THOSE WHO WOULD LIKE TO SEE OUR RELATIONSHIP WORSEN, I INQUIRED WHETHER DR. SHARQ MIGHT SUGGEST ANY WAYS IN WHICH WE COULD HELP TO COUNTER SUCH EFFORTS. HIS REPLY WAS LENGTHY ANS SURPRISINGLY ELOQUENT. HE FIRST SAID THAT WE SHOULD NOT BE MISLED IF A FEW INDIVIDUALS WORKING IN OUR PROJECTS OR IN THOSE OF OTHER FRINDLY DONOR COUNTRIES WERE ARRESTED. THESE INDIVI-    SECRET\n5. DR. SHARQ THEN WITHOUT PROMPTING MOVED TO A MORE DIRECT DISCUSSION OF THE MANY ARRESTS WHICH HAVE OCCURRED SINCE\n6. I EXPRESSED MY GREAT PLEASURE AT HEARING THIS AFFIRMATION, ADMITTED THAT WE TOO HAD HEARD SUCH STORIES, BUT THAT KNOWING AS WE DID THAT THEY WERE ABSOLUTELY FALSE, WE HAD BEEN CONFIDENT THE AFGHAN GOVERNMENT WOULD NOT GIVE THEM CREDENCE. I BRIEFLY SUMMARIZED OUR OVERALL POLICY INTERESTS IN THIS REGION AS BEING WHOLLY DISINTERESTED, IN SUPPORT OF THE INDEPENDENCE AND INTEGRITY OF AFGHANISTAN AS WELL AS THAT OF ITS NEIGHBORS. I EMPHASIZED OUR VIEW THAT STABILITY AND TRANQUILLITY IN THE REGION ARE ESSENTIAL CONDITIONS FOR AFGHANISTAN AND OTHER ADJANCENT COUNTRIES TO DEVELOP IN THE DIRECTION THEIR PEOPLES WISH THEM TO GO.\n7. AS I WAS LEAVING DR. SHARQ AGAIN EMPHASIZED HIS COMPLETE CONFIDENCE IN THE STRENGTH OF US-AFGHAN FRIENDSHIP AND PLEDGED THAT THE REGIME WOULD MAKE SURE THAT NOTHING HAPPENED TO WEAKEN IT. HE ENCOURAGED ME TO CONTACT HIM AT ANY TIME ON ANY MATTER OF CONCERN TO US. HE ADDED THAT WE WOULD SEE IN THE WEEKS AHEAD THAT THE ""REVOLUTIONARIES"" ARE THE ""TRUE FRIENDS OF THE US,"" NOT THE ""CORRUPT REACTIONARIES OF THE OLD REGIME.""\n8. COMMENT: I WAS STRUCK BY THE UNSOLICITED REMARKS SUMMARIZED ABOVE BECAUSE OF SHARQS INTIMATE RELATIONSHIP TO PRESIDENT DAUD AND HIS REPUTATION OF BEING LITTLE MORE THAN A DAUD MOUTHPIECE. IT SEEMS TO US THAT WE HAVE RECEIVED A VERY ENCOURAGING STATEMENT OF PRESIDENT DAUDS CONFIDENCE IN THE FACE OF WHAT HAVE UNDOUBTEDLY BEEN EFFORTS BY OTHERS IN THE REGIME TO LINK US TO THE RECENT PLOT. THIS HAS OCCURED IN TE FACE OF WHAT CERTAINLY SEMS TO BE AN UNSHAKEABLE CONVICTION THAT PAKISTAN HAS BEEN DEEPLY INVOLVED IN THE PLOT, AND THE IMPACT OF BHUTTOS VISIT TO THE US WITH THE STRIKING PUBLIC DEMON- STRATION OF CLOSE US-PAKISTAN TIES. OF COURSE EXTENT TO WHICH SHARQ AND/OR DAUDS CONFIDENCE IN THE PROPRIETY OF US BEHAVIOR HERE IT IS BEING EFFECTIVELY COMMUNICATED DOWNWARD INTO THEM THROUGH THE CENTRAL COMMITTEE TO OHER LAYERS OF THE REGIME MAY BE A DIFFERENT MATTER. SOME DIMINJTION SEEMS TO HAVE ALREADY OCCURRED IN RUMORS ABOUT ALLEGED US INVOLVEMENT. WE WILL TRY TO WATCH AND LISTEN CAREFULLY DURING THE DAYS AHEAD TO SEE IF SHARQS SEEMINGLY AND EVEN FERVENT POLICY STATEMENT IS REFLECTED BY    SECRET\n9. THERE WERE OBVIOUSLY SOME DISTURBING HINTS ABOUT POSSIBLE ARRESTS TO COME, PRESUMABLY AMONG AFGHAN OR THIRD-COUNTRY NATIONAL EMPLOYEES OF THE MISSION WHO MAY BE UNDER SUSPICION. THUS FAR THERE HAVE BEEN SEVERAL CASES OF THESE EMPLOYEES BEING SUMMONED TO THE POLICE STATION AND INTERROGATED ABOUT THE VALIDITY OF THEIR WORK PERMITS AND SO FORTH. HOWEVER, IT CANNOT REASONABLY BE ARGUED THAT WE HAVE BEEN SUBJECTED TO ANY REAL HARRASSMENT TO DATE. SHARQS WORDS LEND HOPE THAT THIS MAY NOT OCCUR. IN AN EARLIER CONVERSATION WITH DEPFONMIN WAHID ABDULLAH I WAS ASSURED THAT AFGHAN GOVERNMENT POLICY DOES NOT LOOK TOWARD PRECIPITATE FIRING OF THIRD-COUNTRY NATIONALS NOW EMPLOYED BY OUR MISSION OR OTHER FOREIGN MISSIONS, WHILE IT DOES URGE REPLACEMENT BY QUALIFIED AFGHANS GRADUALLY AS ATTRITION OCCURS. I WAS HOWEVER WARNED THAT THE GOVERNMENT HAD A ""SERIOUS SPY PROBLEM WITH THE PAKISTANIS HERE"" AND THAT WE SHOULD USE INDIANS RATHER THAN PAKISTANIS AS EMPLOYEES TO AVOID DIFFICULTY.

SOME SORT OF EQUILIBRIUM IS REACHED PROBABLY BEFORE THAT                            TIME HOWEVER IT WILL BECOME CLEAR WHETHER DAUD HAS MASTERED HIS YOUNG                            COLLEAGUES OR THEY HAVE MASTERED HIM6 IT SEEMS HIGHLY LIKELY THAT SOME TIME IN THE WEEKS AHEAD THERE WILL BE                            ONE OR MORE EFFORTS AT SOME KIND OF COUNTER COUP BEFORE AUTHORITY

PREDICTION IS HIGHLY DANGEROUS BUT MY PERSONAL ESTIMATE IS THAT                            THIS THIRD TYPE OF COUP IS THE MOST LIKELY OF THE THREE                            POSSIBILITIES7 THE SOVIET

DAUD IS VERY UNLIKELY TO PLAY DELIBERATELY INTO SOVIET HANDS                            WHILE UNDOUBTEDLY READY TO MILK THE RUSSIANS FOR ALL POSSIBLE ECONOMIC                            AND POLITICAL

ABUNDANTLY CLEAR THAT HE WANTS MASSIVE                            ECONOMIC HELP FROM ALL SOURCES BUT ON HIS OWN TERMS BUT WE ARE NOW                            WITNESSING AND WILL WTTNESS A SUBSTANTIAL INCREASE IN OVERT ANTIAMERICAN SENTIMENT AT                            VARIOUS OTHER LEVELS IN THE NEW REGIME AND WE MUST ANTICIPATE AT LEAST                            SOME DEGREE OF PETTY HARASSMENT IN OUR DEALINGS WITH INDIVIDUAL                            OFFICIALS WHO HAVING BEEN EXCLUDED FROM POWER FOR THE LAST DECADE NOW                            OBTAIN KEY POSITIONS IN THE

             TRYTNG TO SEIZE POWER ON HIS OWN BUT WE BELIEVE THESE INITIAL TWO                            MONTHS HAVE HAD A SOBERING EFFECT ON YOUNG OFFICERS WHO ARE NOW

MOST PROBABLE PROSPECT FOR THE                            REGIME IN THE WEEKS AHEAD TIME IS ON DAUDS SIDE NOT THE YOUNG                            OFFICERS IF HE MANAGES TO STRETCH THE WEEKS INTO SIX

GIVEN AFGHAN COUP OF JULY 17, 1973, WHICH RESULTED IN ESTABLISHMENT OF REPUBLICAN GOVERNMENT OF AFGHANISTAN (GOA) WITH MOHAMMAD DAUD AS PRESIDENT AND PRIME MINISTER, EMBASSY HAS HAD TO RE-EVALUATE AND RE-DIRECT ITS ENTIRE NARCOTICS ACTION PROGRAM TO COMPLY WITH REALITIES OF NEW SITUATION7. THS REALITIES IN RELATION TO NARCOTICS ARE NOT YET CLEARLY DEFINED BECAUSE GOA IS CURRENTLY PREOCCUPIED WITH CONSOLIDATING ITS POWER AND DIRECTING ITS ATTENTION TO PRESSING INTERNAL PROBLEMS. NEVERTHELESS, GOA OFFICIALS (INCLUDING DAUD) HAVE ON SEVERAL RECENT OCCASIONS STATED GOAS COMMITMENT TO ATTACK NARCOTICS PROBLEM MORE EFFECTIVELY. LTEST PRONOUNCEMENT WAS MADE ON AUGUST 28 BY DEPFONMIN WAHID ABDULLAH (REF C). PRES- IDENT DAUD, IN HIS SPEECH TO NATION ON OCCASION OF INDEPENDENCE LIMITED OFFICIAL USE\n2. GIVEN THIS INITIAL, ALBEIT GENER), COMMITMENT BY GOA, EMBASSY WILL NOW DIRECT ITS EFFORTS TOWARD THOSE ELEMENTS WITHIN NEW REGIME WHICH HAVE BEEN OR WILL BE ASSIGNED PRIMARY RESPONSIBILITY FOR NARCOTICS. AT PRESENT, SOLE GOA COMPONENT CHARGED WITH THIS RESPONSIBILITY APPEARS BE MININTERIOR, ALTHOUGH MINJUSTICE STILL RETAINS SOME AS YET UNDEFINED ROLE. CURRENT GOA EMPHASIS APPARENTLY IS ON ENFORCEMENT, ALTHOUGH DAID AND OTHER GOA OFFICIALS STILL MATINTAIN AN INTEREST IN ""DETAILED PLANNING"" ON INCOME SUBSTITUTION AND ECONOMICS DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS IN BADAKSHAN AND NANGARHAR PROVINCES. MINITERIOR NOW BEING REORGANIZED AND PURGED OF ELEMENTS HOSTILE TO NEW REGIME; HENCE, OUR EFFORTS MUST BE CAUTIOUS AND TENTATIVE AT THIS TIME.\n3. MISSION OFFICERS HAVE RECENTLY BEEN IN CONTACT WITH UK, FRG, AND SOVIET EMBOFFS, UN NARCOTICS COORDINATOR (DAVIES), FONMIN AND CHIEF OF STAFF MININTERIOR IN ATTEMPT TO GAIN SOME INSIGHT RE POTENTIAL GOA NARCOTICS ENFORCEMENT CAPABILITIES. CONSENSUS IS GOA APPARENTLY SINCERE ABOUT NARCOTICS ENFORCEMENT, BUT CAPABILITIES REMAIN POOR. IN EFFORT TO IMPROVE MINISTERIOR CAPABILITIES, KABUL DEA REP RECENTLY HAD MEETING WITH CHIEF OF STAFF, MINISTERIOR, MAJOR ABDUL SAMAD AZHAR, WHO EXPRESSED COMMITMENT TO FORM NARCOTICS ENFORCEMENT UNIT UNDER MINIST. HE REQUESTED SOME LIMITED EQUIPMENT FOR ESTABLISHMENT THIS UNIT BASED ON SPECIFIC REQUEST BY PRESIDENT DAUD FOR DEA ASSISTANCE IN FORMATION NARCOTICS UNIT. THIS EQUIPMENT REQUEST WILL B E SUBJECT OF SEPARATE DEA MESSAGE DEA HQS.\n4. GIVEN ABOVE AS BACKGROUND, EMBASSY NOW RE-EVALUATING NEED FOR VARIOUS PROJECTS SUGGESTED IN PREVIOUS NCAP, AS WELL AS REVISING AND RE-DIRECTING NEW PROPOSALS FOR FY 1974 AND FY 1975. THEREFORE REQUEST WASHINGTON CONCURRENCE IN POSTPONEMENT SUBMISSIOM THIS INFORMAION IN FORMAT REQUESTED REF A. REGRET WE CANNOT ESTIMATE WHEN MEANINGFUL AND USEFUL MATERIAL WILL BE AVAILABLE.

JUST PRIOR TO HIS DEPARTURE FROM POST ON SEPTEMBER 10,  AMBASSADOR NEUMANN PAID FAREWELL CALLS ON PRESIDENT DAUD AND HIS BROTHER, MR. NAIM. ATMOSPHERE IN BOTH MEETINGS WAS ESPECIALLY  WARM AND SOMEWHAT NOSTALGIC, WITH BOTH LEADERS EXPRESSING PARTICULAR APPRECIATION THAT AMBASSADOR HAD ATTEMPTED TO MAINTAIN SOME INFORMAL CONTACT WITH THEM DURING TEN YEARS DAUD WAS OUT OF POWER. DAUD PARTICULARLY MADE POINT THAT NO OTHER FOREIGN  CONFIDENTIAL  REPRESENTATIVES HAD DONE SO.\n2. ONLY NEW ITEM OF SIGNIFICANCE IN MEETING WITH NAIM WAS TONE OF DISCUSSION ON PUSHTUNISTAN AND IRAN. NAIM TOOK MUCH MORE BALANCED LINE ON AFGHAN RELATIONS WITH BOTH ITS NEIGHBORS THAN IN PREVIOUS CONVERSATIONS. WITH REGARD TO PAKISTAN, HE SPECIFICALLY STRESSED THAT ""ALL WE WANT IS FOR THE PUSHTUNS TO BE HAPPY IN THEIR OWN COUNTRY,"" A MUCH MORE ENCOURAGING FORMULATION THAN THOSE USED PREVIOUSLY BY GOA SPOKESMEN.\n3. MEETING WITH DAUD ON SEPTEMBER 8 LASTED APPROXIMATELY ONE HOUR, WITH DEPUTY FOREIGN MINISTER WAHID ABDULLAH PRESENT FOR ROUGHLY SECOND HALF. AMBASSADOR REVIEWED CHANGES IN WORLD SITUATION SINCE  THEY HAD FIRST MET IN LOS ANGELES DURING DAUDS EARLIER PRIME MINISTERSHIP. AT THAT TIME, WORLD WAS STILL DOMINATED BY OVER- RIDING EAST-WEST RIVALRY, AND WAS PREOCCUPIED WITH SEEMING  MONOLITHIC CHARACTER OF COMMUNIST BLOCK. THAT TYPE OF CONFRONTATION HAS NOW BEEN MODIFIED. WHILE RIVALRY BETWEEN SOVIET UNION AND US  STILL EXISTS, IN NUCLEAR AGE BOTH SIDES NOW SEEM TO RECOGNIZE THAT DANGERS OF COLLISION ARE TOO GREAT TO RISK. AFGHANISTAN HAS INDEED BENEFITTED ECONOMICALLY IN PAST FROM GREAT POWER RIVALRIES, AND TO SOME EXTENT STILL BENEFITS. AMBASSADOR, HOWEVER, THEN POINTED OUT THAT US POLICY EMPHASIS TOWARD THIS REGION PUTS HEAVY PRIORITY ON STABILITY; AND SOVIET UNION ALSO SEEMS TO DEMONSTRATE CONSIDERABLE SIMILAR INTEREST. GIVEN THIS EMPHASIS ON OVERRIDING POLICY OF REGIONAL STABILITY, AMBASSADOR SAID HE BELIEVED IT WOULD BE VERY DIFFICULT FOR HIS SUCCESSORS TO MAKE AN EFFECTIVE CASE TO EITHER ECONOMIC SUPPORT FOR AFGHANISTAN IF REGIONAL STABILITY WERE TO BE SERIOUSLY THREATENED. WE REALIZE, OF COURSE, THAT STABILITY HARDLY DEPENDS ON AFGHANISTAN ALONE, AND WE HAVE THEREFORE TRIED TO BE HELPFUL IN RESPONSE TO THE GOAS REQUEST FOR OUR ""GOOD OFFICES""  WITH ISLAMABAD IN CONNECTION WITH PUSHTUNISTAN ISSUE. HOWEVER, HE STRESSED, OUR INFLUENCE ON THIS MATTER IS CLEARLY LIMITED. IT IS A PROBLEM WHICH MUST BE RESOLVED BY THE TWO COUNTRIES CONCERNED. HE MERELY WANTED TO UNDERSCORE THAT IN VIEW OF AFGHANISTANS HISTORIC CONCERN FOR PROTECTING ITS OWN INDEPENDENCE BY PRESERVING A BALANCED PRESENCE OF FOREIGN INFLUENCES IN THE COUNTRY, AND IN LIGHT OF THE CURRENT SKEPTICAL CLIMATE IN US CONGRESS WITH REGARD TO FOREIGN ASSISTANCE, PRESIDENT DAUD SHOULD BE EXTREMELY CAUTIOUS AND AS MODERATE AS POSSIBLE IN HIS HANDLING OF PUSHTUNISTAN ISSUE.\n4. IN RESPONSE, DAUD SAID HE DEEPLY APPRECIATED MODERATING COUNCEL WHICH WE HAD GIVEN IN ISLAMABAD AND HOPED WE WOULD CONTINUE TO SUGGEST TO PAKISTANIS THAT THEY BE REASONABLE IN THEIR HANDLING OF THIS DELICATE MATTER. HE SAID HE NOW UNDERSTANDS US POSITION MUCH BETTER. HE HAD ALWAYS TAKEN PAINS TO EXPRESS TO ALL THOSE US AMBASSADORS HE HAD KNOWN OVER THE YEARS THAT AFGHANISTAN ABOVE ALL WISHES TO PROTECT ITS INDEPENDENCE, AND THAT TO DO SO IT NEEDS CONTINUED US SUPPORT. HE EMPHASIZED HIS PEACEFUL INTENTIONS TOWARD PAKISTAN, SAYING HE WOULD DO EVERYTHING POSSIBLE TO HANDLE ISSUE IN A PEACEFUL WAY, AND THAT ONLY UNDER PROVOCATION OF MOST EXTREME OUTBREAK OF VIOLENCE WOULD HE BE FORCED TO A DIFFERENT OUTCOME. (FYI: SUBJECT OF AFGHAN-IRANIAN RELATIONS WAS NOT RAISED.)\n5. IN RESPONSE TO SOME OBSERVATIONS BY AMBASSADOR NEUMANN ABOUT OBVIOUS STATE OF DRIFTG UITSQUBVP NDPUDKLACK OF ECONOMIC DECISIONS, DAUD AGREED THAT ECONOMIC PICTURE WAS A DARK ONE AND SAID THAT STRONGER CENTRALIZED DIRECTION WAS ESSENTIAL. HE SAID THAT GOVERN- MENT WAS MOVING TOWARD SOME SOLUTIONS, BUT THAT US MUST UNDERSTAND  THAT THESE SOLUTIONS WOULD NECESSARILY REQUIRE A MORE ""DIRIGISTE"" ECONOMIC SYSTEM THAN THAT CURRENTLY IN EFFECT. HE SAID THAT FREE ENTERPRISE WAS NEEDED AND MUST BE ENCOURAGED, BUT THAT IT HAD BEEN BADLY MISUSED UNDER PREVIOUS REGIME. HE CITED AS EXAMPLE IMPORT OF GOODS FREE OF DUTY UNDER PRIVATE INVESTMENT LAW, OSTENSIBLY AS RAW MATERIALS FOR LOCAL MANUFACTURE, WHICH WERE IMMEDIATELY RE-EXPORTED ILLEGALLY BY PRIVATE SECTOR. DAUD SAID THAT THROUGHOUT ECONOMY, AT LEAST FOR TIME BEING, ECONOMIC ACTIVITY MUST BE ""DIRECTED""\n6. IN A PARALLEL DISCUSSION OF THE FUTURE POLITICAL SYSTEM HE WISHED TO SEE EVOLVE, DAUD SAID THAT WORK WAS NOW GOING FORWARD ON DRAFTING NEW CONSTITUTION, BUT THAT IT WOULD BE PERHAPS A YEAR IN GESTATION. HE ENVISIONED INITIALLY A ONE PARTY SYSTEM, EVENTUALLY ADDING A SECOND OPPOSITION PARTY WHICH, HOWEVER, WOULD BE CONTROLLED TO SOME EXTENT TO PRECLUDE THE TYPE OF ""IRRESPONSIBLE OPPOSITION"" DEMONSTRATED BY PARLIAMENTS DURING THE PAST DECADE.\n7. COMMENT: TONE AND ATMOSPHERE OF MEETING COULD NOT HAVE BEEN MORE FRIENDLY, AND WE ARE HEARING FROM OFFICIALS AT ALL LEVELS  ECHOES OF DAUDS LINE THAT GOA WISHES NOT ONLY CONTINUE BUT INCREASE CONFIDENTIAL  SUPPORT AND ASSISTANCE FROM US AND OTHER FOREIGN FRIENDS. WE UNDERSTAND THAT SPIRITED STRUGGLE HAS BEEN GOING ON OVER PROPOSAL TO INTRODUCE STRICT EXCHANGE CONTROLS, BITTERLY OPPOSED BY PRIVATE SECTOR AS BOTH UNWORKABLE AND ECONOMICALLY DISASTROUS. OUTCOME NOT YET ANNOUNCED, ALTHOUGH DAUDS REMARKS ABOUT NEED FOR A MUCH MORE ""DIRIGISTE"" ECONOMIC SYSTEM MAKES IT LIKELY THAT CONTROLS WILL IN  SOME FORM BE IMPOSED. LEWIS\n",1358143

DAUD IS VERY UNLIKELY TO PLAY DELIBERATELY INTO SOVIET HANDS                            WHILE UNDOUBTEDLY READY TO MILK THE RUSSIANS FOR ALL POSSIBLE ECONOMIC                            AND POLITICAL

ABUNDANTLY CLEAR THAT HE WANTS MASSIVE                            ECONOMIC HELP FROM ALL SOURCES BUT ON HIS OWN TERMS BUT WE ARE NOW                            WITNESSING AND WILL WTTNESS A SUBSTANTIAL INCREASE IN OVERT ANTIAMERICAN SENTIMENT AT                            VARIOUS OTHER LEVELS IN THE NEW REGIME AND WE MUST ANTICIPATE AT LEAST                            SOME DEGREE OF

BE                            RECOGNIZED AND ACCEPTED AS AN AUTHENTIC AFGHAN NATIONAL LEADER BY THE                            ARMY THE TRIBES THE EDUCATED ELITE THE STUDENTS AND THE MASS OF THE

             TRYTNG TO SEIZE POWER ON HIS OWN BUT WE BELIEVE THESE INITIAL TWO                            MONTHS HAVE HAD A SOBERING EFFECT ON YOUNG OFFICERS WHO ARE NOW

CONSIDERABLY                            BETTER THAN EVEN THAT DAUD WILL GRADUALLY CONSOLIDATE HIS PERSONAL                            CONTROL OVER THE REGIME RECREATING IN LARGE MEASURE THE PRICKLY

MOST PROBABLE PROSPECT FOR THE                            REGIME IN THE WEEKS AHEAD TIME IS ON DAUDS SIDE NOT THE YOUNG                            OFFICERS IF HE MANAGES TO STRETCH THE WEEKS INTO SIX

THE ORATORY WAS MUTED, IN FACT UNCOMMONLY MUTED. EVEN THE EXCITABLE (AND UNSUITABLE) PAKISTANI AMBASSADOR CAME TO THAT CONCLUSION.\n2. PUBLIC INDIFFERENCE WAS MANIFEST. WHY THIS COMEDOWN AFTER THE EARLIER OVEREMPHASIS OF THE DAUD REGIME? (A) I BELIEVE OUR TACTFUL BUT FIRM PRESENTATIONS TO NAIM AND WAHID ABDULLAH HAVE HAD SOME EFFECT -- AFTER DAUD HAD HAD A LITTLE TIME TO REFLECT ON THE IMPLICATIONS OF RASH ACTION. (B) PROBABLY EQUALLY IMPORTANT ( I REGRET TO ADMIT) IS THAT THE SOVIET AMBASSADOR ALSO HAS BEEN COUNSELLING PRUDENCE, ADVISING DAUD NOT TO PUSH PASHTUNISTAN TOO HARD. THIS INFORMATION COMES NOT ONLY FROM SOVIET AMBASSADOR PUZANOV, BUT ALSO FROM DEPFONMIN ABDULLAH WHO RUEFULLY COMPLAINED THAT WE, I.E., THE UNITED STATES, AND THE RUSSIANS ARE ""GETTING CONFIDENTIAL  TOO COZY, SINCE YOU ARE EVEN GIVING THE SAME ADVICE.""  (C) THERE IS REAL FEAR OF WAR AMONG AT LEAST SOME OF THE PUSHTUNISTANIANS"" AND CERTAINLY AMONG MANY OTHERS. (D) THE REGIME IS STILL FAR TOO UNSTABLE AND ITS INTERNAL PERFORMANCE TOO POOR TO ENGAGE IN AN EXCESSIVE FOREIGN ADVENTURE AT THIS TIME.\n3. I APPRECIATE THE FLEXIBILITY THE DEPARTMENTS RECENT MESSAGES HAVE GIVEN ME, AND HOPE THAT AFTER MY DEPARTURE, THE CHARGE AND AMBASSADOR ELIOT WILL BE GIVEN THE SAME LEEWAY.

IDEOLOGICAL AND PERSONAL CONFLICTS IN THIS SOCIETY MOST AFGHAN                            OBSERVERS BELIEVE THAT THE PROCESS WILL REQUIRE UP TO SIX MONTHS TO PLAY                            OUT BEFORE SOME SORT OF EQUILIBRIUM IS REACHED PROBABLY BEFORE THAT                            TIME HOWEVER IT WILL BECOME CLEAR WHETHER DAUD HAS MASTERED HIS YOUNG                            COLLEAGUES OR THEY HAVE MASTERED HIM6 IT SEEMS HIGHLY LIKELY THAT SOME TIME IN THE WEEKS AHEAD THERE WILL BE                            ONE OR MORE EFFORTS AT SOME KIND OF COUNTER COUP BEFORE AUTHORITY

POLICE ELEMENTS CONCERNED                            ABOUT THE DIRECTION OF EVENTS AND THEIR PERSONAL DOWNFALLS WHO MAY SEEK                            TO REINSTATE THEIR OWN PRIMACY UNDER THE COVER

MOMENT                            AND ASSERT FIRMLY HIS SOLE AUTHORITY NO ONE WHO LIVED THROUGH THE                            PREVIOUS DAUD REGIME IN THE 1950S OR WHO KNOWS HIM PERSONALLY BELIEVES                            HE IS TEMPERAMENTALLY SUITED LONG TO PLAY A GENERAL NAQUIB ROLE TN THE                            NEW REVOLUTIONARY REGIME HOWEVER TEN YEARS ABSENCE FROM POWER HAS                            DEPRIVED DAUD OF A NUMBER OF OLDER COLLABORATORS ON WHOM HE WOULD HAVE                            OTHERWISE RELIED AS ALLIES THEY ARE EITHER DEAD OR INACTIVE                            CONSEQUENTLY HIS PERSONAL POWER BASE IS PROBABLY RELATIVELY SMALL A                            MISSTEP IN HANDLING THE EXPLOSIVE PUSHTUNTSTAN ISSUE COULD WELL TRIGGER                            AN UPHEAVAL PREMATURE FOR HIS DESIGNS AND THIS REALIZATION MAY ACCOUNT                            FOR THE GREATER CAUTION HE HAS BEEN SHOWING ON THIS QUESTION IN RECENT                            WEEKS PREDICTION IS HIGHLY DANGEROUS BUT MY PERSONAL ESTIMATE IS THAT                            THIS THIRD TYPE OF COUP IS THE MOST LIKELY OF THE THREE                            POSSIBILITIES7 THE SOVIET

DAUD IS VERY UNLIKELY TO PLAY DELIBERATELY INTO SOVIET HANDS                            WHILE UNDOUBTEDLY READY TO MILK THE RUSSIANS FOR ALL POSSIBLE ECONOMIC                            AND POLITICAL

ABUNDANTLY CLEAR THAT HE WANTS MASSIVE                            ECONOMIC HELP FROM ALL SOURCES BUT ON HIS OWN TERMS BUT WE ARE NOW                            WITNESSING AND WILL WTTNESS A SUBSTANTIAL INCREASE IN OVERT ANTIAMERICAN SENTIMENT AT                            VARIOUS OTHER LEVELS IN THE NEW REGIME AND WE MUST ANTICIPATE AT LEAST                            SOME DEGREE OF PETTY HARASSMENT IN OUR DEALINGS WITH INDIVIDUAL                            OFFICIALS WHO HAVING BEEN EXCLUDED FROM POWER FOR THE LAST DECADE NOW                            OBTAIN KEY POSITIONS IN THE POLICE AND IN THE CIVILIAN MINISTRIES8 FOR THE PRESENT DAUD REMAINS INDISPENSABLE TO EVERYONE FOR HE IS THE                            ONLY FIGURE ON THE HORIZON WHO FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE WOULD BE                            RECOGNIZED AND ACCEPTED AS AN AUTHENTIC AFGHAN NATIONAL LEADER BY THE                            ARMY THE TRIBES THE EDUCATED ELITE THE STUDENTS AND THE MASS OF THE                            POPULATION WHETHER THEY ARE LEFTISTORIENTED OR RATHER MORE ATTACHED TO                            TRADITIONAL AFGHAN VALUES THIS WOULD NOT FORECLOSE SOME YOUNG MAJOR                            TRYTNG TO SEIZE POWER ON HIS OWN BUT WE BELIEVE THESE INITIAL TWO                            MONTHS HAVE HAD A SOBERING EFFECT ON YOUNG OFFICERS WHO ARE NOW

CONSIDERABLY                            BETTER THAN EVEN THAT DAUD WILL GRADUALLY CONSOLIDATE HIS PERSONAL                            CONTROL OVER THE REGIME RECREATING IN LARGE MEASURE THE PRICKLY                            INWARDLOOKING INDEPENDENT HYPERNATIONALISTIC AND UNIQUELY AFGHAN                            TYPE OF POLITICAL SYSTEM WHICH HE LED IN THE LATE 1950S BARRING A MORE

MOST PROBABLE PROSPECT FOR THE                            REGIME IN THE WEEKS AHEAD TIME IS ON DAUDS SIDE NOT THE YOUNG                            OFFICERS IF HE MANAGES TO STRETCH THE WEEKS INTO SIX

RELIABLE SOURCE NOW SAYS ABOUT 650 ARRESTS HAVE SO FAR BEEN MADE, THAT INVESTIGATIONS AND ARRESTS ARE CONTINUING, MOST ARE MILITARY PERSONNEL, AND THAT NO ONE HAS SO FAR BEEN RELEASED. SAME SOURCE ADDS THAT ALL PAKISTANIS IN KABUL ARE NOW UNDER SPECIAL 24-HOUR SURVEILLANCE, AND THAT LARGE NUMBERS OF MILITARY (NOT POLICE) NOW ON SPECIAL SURVEILLANCE DUTY THROUGHOUT CITY IN PLAIN CLOTHESE. ( THIS CONFIRMED TO SOME EXTENT BY DIRECT OBSERVATIONS.)\n2. MANY SOURCES HAVE REPORTED COLONEL SYED AMIR, WHO BECAME COMMANDER AIR AND AIR DEFENSE FORCES AFTER JULY COUP, INCLUDED IN THOSE ARRESTED. TWO SOURCES HAVE INDICATED AMIR HAD PREPARED JET BOMBER WITH BOMBS AND ROCKETS IN ORDER ATTACK DAUDS RESIDENCE. ONE OF THESE SOURCES CLAIMS GOVERNMENT ACTED ONLY TWO HOURS BEFORE SCHEDULED TIMING FOR ATTACK ON DAUD RESIDENCE. OTHER SOURCES HAVE CLAIMED COUP ATTEMPT WAS SCHEDULED FOR SEPTEMBER 21. DIFFICULT AT THIS TIME ASCERTAIN HOW MUCH OF THIS RATIONALSE IS GOVERNMENT INSPIRED, HOW MUCH MERELY RUMOR AND HOW MUCH, IF ANY, ACTUAL FACT. ACTING DEPFONMIN KARIM INFORMED ADCM SEPTEMBER 23 THAT INVESTIGATION STILL CONTINUING BUT HE HOPED PROVIDE US WITH GUIDANCE AND/OR INFORMATION ON COUP ATTEMPT ""IN ONE OR TWO DAYS TIME.""\n3. IN RELATED DEVELOPMENT, KABUL RADIO ANNOUNCED SEPTEMBER 23 GOA HAD REJECTED PAKISTANI PROTEST NOTE CONCERNING PAZHWAKS SPEECH AT NAC (REF C). IN WHAT APPEARS BE RELATED DEVELOPMENT, KABUL RADIO SAME EVENING ENNOUNCED NAIM DISCUSSION WITH INDIAN DEFENSE MINISTER. WHILE RADIO ALSO REPORTED NAIM CALL ON INDIAN PLANNING MINISTER (BUT MADE NO MENTION DISCUSSIONS WITH PRIMIN GANDHI) SEVERAL AFGHAN LISTENERS WERE STRUCK BY IMPLICATION MEETING WITH DEFENSE MINISTER WAS OF PARTICULAR IMPORTANCE. (COMMENT: THIS WOULD SEEM BE EFFORT DRAW ATTENTION PAKISTANIS THAT INDIA MIGHT RPT MIGHT BECOME INVOLVED IF FURTHER DETERIORATION OCCURS IN AFGHAN/PAKISTANI RELATIONS.)\n4. IN COMPARING ""KABUL TIMES"" ENGLISH TEXT OF AFGHAN STATEMENT ON PAKISTAN WITH ""JUMHORIAT"" TEXT, WE FIND SMALL DIFFERENCE WHICH TENDS MAKE ENGLISH TEXT SLIFHTLY SOFTER. ENGLISH TEXT DOES NOT REFER TO WARNING AS ""SECOND"" OR ""FINAL."" IT MERELY REQUESTS PAKISTAN CEASE THIS TYPE PROVOCATION WHEREAS ""JUMHORIAT"" CLEARLY STATES THIS IS SECOND WARNING TO PAKISTAN. NEWLY ARRIVED NON- RESIDENT AUSTRALIAN AMBASSADOR MORRIS PRESENTED CREDENTIALS TO PRESIDENT DAUD SEPTEMBER 23 AND WAS STRUCK BY FERVENT TONE OF DAUDS COMMENTS ABOUT PUSHTUNISTAN ISSUE. HOWEVER, DAUD WAS VERY CAREFUL TO USE PHRASE ""SOME PERSONS IN PAKISTAN"" IN DISCUSSING SUPPORT FOR THE ALLEGED ""PLOT."" NOT RPT NOT THE ""PAKISTAN GOVERNMENT.""\n5. COMMANDER OF POLICE KADIR HAS SENT MEMORANDUM TO AFGHAN POLICE INSTRUCTING THAT SOCIAL CONTACTS WITH FRG POLICE ADVISERS ARE TO CONFIDENTIAL BE AVOIDED. ACCORDING GERMAN SOURCES, AFGHAN POLICE HAVE INTERPRETED THIS AS DIRECTIVE KEEP APART FROM GERMAN ADVISERS, AND OFFICE CONTACTS HAVE BEEN REDUCED AS WELL.\n6. SENIOR OFFICERS MENTIONED PARA ONE REF B ARE GENERAL ABDUL SALAM MALIKYAR AND GENERAL ABDUL JABAR MALIKYAR. IT IS POSSIBLE THAT FIRST GENERAL IS ABDUL SALAM OF GHAZNI WHOSE ARREST WE HAVE REPORTED.

OFFICER CORPS OBVIOUSLY BEING HURT BY THESE ARRESTS, AS IS PUBLIC CONFIDENCE IN REGIME.
