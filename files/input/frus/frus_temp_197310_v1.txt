the                            fighting assured the King that the United States was making every                            effort to end the conflict and agreed that the Security Council meeting                            should lay the groundwork for getting meaningful negotiations going on                            a fundamental settlement Ibid1 Delivered Secretarys message to King at 1100 local after he had finally                        had seven hours of sleep2 He immediately drafted reply which is quoted below This is a personal                        draft and unedited except for some spelling corrections It is good                        representation of his streamofconsciousness style Zaid Rifai read letter                        and made no change in it other than to substitute words as to the status                        quo ante for words on the present lines This comes towards end of                        message3 King asked it be sent immediately He and Zaid then talked of the                        necessity of a prompt simple call for a ceasefire They said that if the                        US wanted to talk about the status quo ante it would be better to say                        status quo ante bellum 19674 Following is Kings message: I do believe very firmly that all efforts                        should be made to bring to an end as rapidly as possible this madness that                        has caused and is causing with every hour more dear losses of life and more                        misery and suffering I know sir of the United States efforts and your                        good self towards this endI believe on the one hand that what has come to be is a direct result of                        Israels lack of contribution since June 1967 towards the establishment of                        an honorable just and durable peace Israels military arrogance                        expansionist demands condescending attitude and overconfidence They sadly                        seemed throughout to lack the courage or ability to believe in a real peace                        which can only exist and last when two sides feel that it came to exist on                        honorable bases causing them to build on it and safeguard it as opposed to                        living within a fortress and with a fortress mentality in isolation from all                        around them and the will to try out another course The only course worthy                        of consideration is that of peace Israel has stated her belief in                        insulating her security otherwise by depending on outposts and positions on                        the ground and the reaction was inevitable and regardless of the outcome                        unless Israels attitude basically changes in the future inevitably                        reactions and responses will come again and again with more chaos anarchy                        suffering loss of life instability and miseryOn the other hand both Presidents Sadat and Assad have taken on their own without any prior                        notification of plan or timing the responsibility for this military action                        which in itself shows that a lesson was learned from the Israelis in terms                        of timing and the use of the element of surprise They were under tremendous                        pressures I have no doubt to do something and I repeatedly warned of that                        but on their shoulders I feel lies the heaviest of responsibilities now                        for the entire future of this area as a result of their decision and chosen                        course Forces are locked in mortal combat and neither side can afford to                        lose Behind the scene are many an interested party to turn this area into                        a real hell and reap the rewards The Soviets have assured us of their                        support and indicated a favorable view to all and total Arab involvement as                        rapidly as possible and there are many in the area who wish either                        defensively such as the Saudis and their desire to send their brigade to                        share in the honor of fighting with those who have obviously that sense of                        honorSyria Iraq wishes us to send them our tank transporters to help them                        move via Jordan to Syria which we refused in both cases since we need our                        own transporters and since there is a direct route into Syria from Iraq                        incidentally there are 200 Iraqi tanks in Syria or on their way with an                        initial two fighter squadrons and possibly four by now There are eager                        elements that wish to thrive and will do so on ruin and disasterAnd there are enormous pressures on us for Palestine is more closely                        connected with our very existence than with any other Arab party involved                        Until now we have taken such action despite these pressures and Israeli                        aerial continued violations and provocations as to maintain calm and self                        control Militarily this is sound at this stage and we have sufficient                        sound military arguments to maintain this stance due to the situation to our north and in Sinai                        but for how long can we exercise this selfcontrol if fighting continues                        together with provocations and pressuresIn                            telegram 1542 from USDAOTel Aviv

tirade stating                            that if Hussein caused any waves                            Israel would dedicate the IDF to the                            task of completely destroying

status quo ante and then a serious effort to bring this conflict                        to a final end Whether this could come soon or whether it would be accepted                        by the fighting parties and others I would not know but it would certainly                        improve the image of the United States enormously to advocate such a course                        and do all

preceded discussion in Ammans 5398 NotalIn                            telegram 5398 from Amman October 10 Brown reported that the King had just told him that he                            was about to authorize dispatch of a Jordanian armored brigade to Syria                            saying that this was the least he could do under the circumstances The                            Ambassador commented that he had not repeated this devastating news                            elsewhere because he hoped that the United States might be able to                            deter or at least defer the decision Ibid Box 1174 Harold H Saunders Files Middle East                            Negotiations Files 1973 Middle East War File 5 October 10 1973 The                                CIA

 desperately looking for some way out of his present dilemma short of                            becoming directly involved in the fighting The King apparently still                            hoped that the Israelis would not attack Jordan in reprisal but he had                            ordered a general mobilization of the Jordanian army just in case                            Ibid King said he is in real trouble No matter how the war                        goes he will be the goat and probably the pariah of the Arab world If he is                        to keep out of the war he must know and be able to convince his people that                        he has taken the right course He needs solid reassurances from the US                        not vague ones He expects us to obtain a ceasefire and prompt progress                        towards a implementation of 242 and b return of Arab Jerusalem to the                        Arabs He also needs to know that he will get the military equipment and                        financial assistance he will require if the Arab states cut him off3 sic I told him to look at the alternatives The                        Israeli generals are in a bitter nasty mood Any military action by Jordan                        will not be merely a tank battle in the Valley wherein if extremely lucky                        Jordan will pick up a few square miles of West Bank territory It will be                        the total destruction of Jordans undefended infrastructure: its port                        refinery power stations

if Hussein was foolish enough to intervene in the war                                Allon noted that Hussein had lost a good deal of his                            Kingdom the last time he had relieved the Syrians and that there would                            be little to reign over if he made the same mistake again Keating reported that he had pointed                            out to Allon that it was in their                            mutual interests that Hussein not                            only not intervene but that he survive the current hostilities Ibid

                response to the questions he has asked but that on my own I wanted to ask                        again about possible Jordanian intervention in Syria I said that King                        should examine his decision very carefully to see if his action would give a                        casus belli to Israel I said that if I judge the frustration and anger of                        the Israeli military rightly he might well be doing that by sending a                        brigade to Syria even if he stood fast on the JordanIsrael line2 King reflected a bit He said that what he is really thinking about is the                        future He will not take any action immediately He will keep in touch with                        us and talk to us in advance3 I said give us real notice I know Washington is working on his problem                        But it takes time4 What he will do is put the 40th Brigade on alert This amused him greatly                        It was the 40th that stood the brunt of the Syrian attack in 19705 What he plans to do is should conditions worsen so far as the Syrians are                        concerned is offer the 40th to take over duties east of Golan and on the                        Jordanian border now carried out by Syrian reserve thus freeing Syrian                        units for combat He said it is not looking for combat with the Israelis He                        is just trying to cover himself with the Arabs if the situation deteriorates                        rapidly If the present stalemate continues he

                        Rifai who was present backed me up At one moment he said                        that while Iraq has no common border with Israel if things went bad it                        might soon have one9 During talk King said that Iraqis had now asked for 14 tank transporters                        after Syrians had said they would do no good He is sending them lets

Before reftel came I was with King                        together with the British Ambassador Events have progressed considerably                        Ambassador gave message to King from Kidron representing still unofficial views of Israelis                        Message states in substance 1 Tell us where your troops will be 2 Give                        us the best assurances possible that you will not open fire Implication is                        that if two questions answered favorably Israelis will avoid fight with                        Jordanian forces3 We spent considerable time negotiating exactly what the answers would be                        In midst of talk message came that Idi Amin would be arriving in Amman any minute King immediately left for                        front with Bin Shaker leaving Rifai                        and Hassan to deal with Amin4 Basically what British Ambassador will reply to UK Embassy Tel Aviv for transmission to the Israelis is that                        Jordanian line will start from Jordanian border east of Wadi Ruggad                        northward towards Sheikh Miskin with northern anchor not yet defined but                        probably definable by dawn As to question of firing that remains moot                        After King left leaving answer to this still up in air but implying that                        Jordanians would be in defensive position Hassan and Rifai argued in long                        and confused fashion as to who would fire at what and under what                        circumstances In order to come to read reftel I left British Ambassador to sort out exactly what he                        would reply The questions were put to the British and not to us He will do                        his best to put best possible light on Jordanian reply5 What is the confusion It is simple Hassan wants to avoid bloodshed but                        have Jordanian presence on the front now that King has so decided Rifai                        told me privately on doorstep that what is required is that there be                        Jordanian martyrs6 What does the King think He seems to share both viewpoints Tonight he is                        Bayard on the white horse7 Comment What we do Nothing The British are the                        gobetween on this one so far as I know Maybe the US also in the act but I am not It looks like reftel is OBE as the Jordanians are in Syria and will not retreat What                        we are now trying to avoid is a JordanianIsraeli

                      various forces Israel should consider the Jordanian expeditionary force of                        the 40th Armored Brigade as hostile as of yesterday morning2 Israelis have also been informed that the King and his headquarters have                        been under pressure directly from Assad to either withdraw the brigade or                        have it carry out its military duties at what was then the 8th day of the                        war The brigade on the 8th day is within the danger zone but had not yet                        taken any action King has informed PM that brigade will inevitably be in                        action Moreover King has also informed PM that as to the probable future                        location of the brigade it has been given so many contradictory orders that                        it is impossible to predict where it will be at any given moment3 Dinitz says that the Israeli                        understanding is that the Jordanian brigade will be working in coordination                        with the Iraqi forces: in effect it is becoming part of the Iraqi movement                        in the area4 In these circumstances according to Israeli Amb the least harm would be done if in addition to this                        force no additional force was sent into action in this region or any other                        region of the front with Jordan and that the existing Jordanian force there                        would receive instructions not to engage heavily in battle This is said                        with the hope that the engagement should it occur will be limited5 Israeli Ambassador went on to say that naturally Israel will be forced to                        fight when they are attacked Ambassador then asked us whether we would do                        everything within our power to impress upon the Jordanians the objectives                        stated above6 Ambassador should see King immediately and weigh in in the above                        sense7 FYI: Dinitz says he knows we carry unit as 40th Armored Brigade                        although his own people insist on calling it the 4th Brigade He and we both curious about the difference                        but assume that reference is unmistakably to the single Jordan brigade thus

it is I am confident that His Majesty will maintain his                        position of statesmanship2 Second our desires and hopes for a peaceful settlement are stronger today                        than ever before In all the many consultations I have had in recent days                        the interests of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan have been very much in the

expression of these responsibilities3 I know Your Majesty with all of your experience and wisdom that you will                        appreciate that I am engaged in delicate and complex discussions I want you                        to know specifically what I am doing We are talking to the Soviets with a                        view to agreeing to a SC resolution which                        calls for a ceasefire in place to be followed promptly by negotiations                        between the parties on a fundamental settlement In such a settlement Your                        Majesty it is inconceivable that the interests of Jordan which you so                        eloquently explained to me would not be fully protected I give you a                        formal assurance to this effect4 Your Majesty we believe that a new strategic situation has been createda                        situation in which the necessity of a political settlement is becoming                        clearer to all parties and in which it will be less difficult for the US                        to exercise effective and constructive influence5 Your Majesty the US knows who its friends are There can and will be no                        settlement without the fullest consultation between us Your views will I                        can assure you be given the full weight they deserve6 During this difficult period in which our intensive diplomatic efforts are                        continuing I urge you to maintain the confidence in what we are seeking to                        accomplish

         resupply schedule we have agreed upon In fact it should be stepped up                        slightly along the lines of the plan described by Schlesinger in our meeting yesterdaySee Document

20 1957Z the White House                            transmitted a situation report that had just been given to Scowcroft by Dinitz The forward thrust of Israeli                            forces west of the canal continued and they were engaged in the                            destruction of large parts of the two Egyptian armies holding the canal                            as well as the missile sites protecting those armies from air attack                            Israeli forces had seized the initiative causing confusion and                            dislocation to the enemy A wedge had been introduced in the Egyptian                            front and the two armies were practically separated from each other The                            report said that when the ceasefire came into force it should find                            Israel holding a line that made sense from a politicomilitary point of                            view The Syrian front had been essentially static throughout the past                            week but Israeli forces had inflicted serious damage on the various                            contingents making up the multinational forces reinforcing

rounded offTo: Secretary KissingerFrom: The President1 I have just written a note to BrezhnevDocument 217 emphasizing to him that you speak with                        my full authority and the commitments you may make in the course of your                        discussions with him have my complete support I also told him that you would be conveying to him my                        strong commitment to devote my personal efforts toward bringing a lasting                        peace to the area2 I believe that beyond a doubt we are now facing the best opportunity we                        have had in 15 years to build a lasting peace in the Middle East I am                        convinced that history will hold us responsible if we let this opportunity                        slip by3 The current Israeli successes at Suez must not deflect us from going all                        out to achieve a just settlement now There is no reason to believe that                        Israel will not win this war now as it has won all the previous ones but                        you and I know that in the long run the Israelis will not be able to stand                        the continuing attrition which in the absence of a settlement they will be                        destined to suffer4 It is therefore even in Israels best interests for us to use whatever                        pressures may be required in order to gain acceptance of a settlement which                        is reasonable and which we can ask the Soviets to press on the Arabs5 Our greatest foreign policy weakness over the past four and a half years                        has been our failure to deal decisively with the Middle East crisis This is                        due to three reasons:A The intransigence of the IsraelisB The unwillingness of the Arabs to engage themselves in discussions on a                        realistic basisC Our preoccupation with other initiatives preventing us from devoting the                        time required to the issue6 I now consider a permanent Middle East settlement to be the most important                        final goal to which we must devote ourselves US political considerations                        will have absolutely no repeat no influence whatever on our decisions in                        this regard I want you to know that I am prepared to pressure the Israelis                        to the extent required regardless of the domestic political                        consequences7 Please convey to Brezhnev the                        following:A Tell him that this is an area as distinguished from MFN where I can deliver on commitments                        without the requirement for Congressional approval Point out to him that if                        he and I together can be reasonable and achieve a Middle East settlement it                        will be without question one of the brightest stars in which we hope will be                        a galaxy for peace stemming from the NixonBrezhnev                        relationshipB Tell him that each of us have very difficult clients and that we must                        therefore keep our commitments in as general terms as possible Assure him                        however that our reluctance to be specific is not the result of any                        intention to avoid reaching a settlement but that it is based on our conviction that this is the only way he                        and I will be able to get our clients in line and thereby achieve a                        settlementC You can also inform him that I remember our discussions on the Middle                        East in my home at San ClementeSee Documents 73 and 74 and that I realize now that he was right in his                        concern about the danger of an imminent explosion in the Middle East One                        war in the Middle East in 20 years would have been too much To have had                        four wars during this period is intolerable and we must now take decisive                        action to resolve the problem Only the US and the Soviet Union have the                        power and influence to create the permanent conditions necessary to avoid                        another war If we fail history and the thousands of brave men who die in                        the next war as well as their widows and children will hold us                        accountableD Now is the time for both of us to face up to the hard choices which we                        have not confronted in the past Neither of us nor any of those nations                        which we support can have a solution fully to its satisfaction There must                        be give on both sides The Israelis and Arabs will never be able to approach                        this subject by themselves in a rational manner That is why Nixon and Brezhnev looking at the problem more dispassionately must                        step in determine the proper course of action to a just settlement and                        then bring the necessary pressure on our respective friends for a settlement                        which will at last bring peace to this troubled areaIn telegram Tohak                            35WH32566 October 20 2343Z Scowcroft

the                            Brezhnev letter and the failure                        to let me know in advance that a press statement be issuedThe letter to Brezhnev is Document 217

with Haig before final decisions were made3 The letter to Brezhnev has already                        been used against me the General Secretary refused to accept it when I told                        him I would have to refer any scheme back to Washington for consideration                        citing the fact that I already had full powers granted me by the                        President4 As a result my position here is almost insoluble If I carry out the                        letter of the Presidents instructions it will totally wreck what little                        bargaining leverage I still have Our first objective must be a ceasefire                        that will be tough enough to get the Israelis to accept it will be                        impossible as part of a global deal If the war continues the consequences                        will be incalculable We can pursue the course the President has in mind                        after a ceasefire made with Israeli acquiescence but not before In the                        meantime a continuation of public comment can only ruin us all around5 It will be a near miracle if we bring off a ceasefire but I think it can                        be done if we stay disciplined The President can then work as he                        wishes6 I want you to know that I consider the tone and substance of his

the fact                            that the instructions had been sent He commented that the message                            dictated personally by Nixon                            was however much I disagreed with it an acute discussion of the Middle                            East problem a remarkable feat of concentration considering the                            Watergate storm raging about him Kissinger noted that the instructions expressed                                Nixons conviction that the                            Soviet Union and the United States should jointly use the end of the war                            to impose a comprehensive peace in the Middle East He remarked that it                            had been a blessing that he had been ignorant of this message during his                            session with Brezhnev since                            American strategy so far had been to separate                            the ceasefire from a postwar political settlement and to reduce the                            Soviet role in the negotiations that would follow the ceasefire Years of Upheaval pp 550551	19731021frus1969-76v25d222	222

Message for the President follows:A After five hours I have agreed with Secretary General Brezhnev on a Security Council resolution                        which:1 Calls for a cease fire in place to be

the Soviet Union and informed them that he had met with                            the Soviet leaders for several hours since his arrival He said that                            they had agreed to the text of a UN                            resolution which would be introduced in the Security Council at 9 pm                            New York time that night and that the United States and the

                  obviously could not tell their governments what to do but he stressed                            that anyone who was interested in a quick end to the fighting would                            presumably desist from trying to make amendments to this Resolution                            The memorandum of conversation October 21 is ibid Box 76 Country

addition two important understandings were agreed to between the                        Secretary General and myself:1 That the negotiations between the parties would be under joint USUSSR auspices as you instructed me to                        accomplish2 That the US and the USSR will press                        for an immediate exchange of all prisoners of warD This is a major accomplishment for the policy which you initiated a week                        ago I hope the Israelis will as they should take this as a major victory                        The settlement makes clear beyond any question that the US is the dominant                        influence in the area without which nothing can be accomplished It will                        stop the fighting with Israeli forces both in Syrian and Egyptian territory                        there is absolutely no reference to 242 most important we have finally                        achieved direct negotiations between the parties we have Brezhnevs pledge that he will produce the                        Arabs on a prisoner exchange and most importantly we have faced down the                        Soviets for all the world to seeE I suggest that simultaneously with the 6:00 pm joint USUSSR request for a Security Council meeting                            Ziegler make an announcement as                        follows:As a result of talks between Secretary General Brezhnev and Secretary of State Henry Kissinger I have directed Ambassador Scali to join with the Soviet UN representative Mr Malik in requesting an immediate meeting                        of the Security Council this evening The United States and the USSR have agreed on a resolution which will                        be submitted jointly to the Council this eveningF Beyond this announcement nothing should be said or hinted or the whole                        thing will come apartG Gromyko and I will draft joint                        instructions to

                 that the President was demonstrating his leadership in the crisis All the                        actions which took place were designed to illustrate that he was personally                        in charge I am sure that you are fully aware of all the motivations behind                        this activity and we discussed some of them before your departure2 The tape issue and the RichardsonRuckelshausCox                        affair is now dominating the news and activities here Initial media                        reaction has appeared quite negative The development of this domestic                        crisis gave additional impetus to efforts Saturday to show that the                        Presidents ability to govern was unaffected by the Watergate related                        turmoil In that regard I should point out that there was no special press                        statement issued yesterday The statement to which you refer came out as a                        part of Jerrys normal briefingSee footnote 3 Document 214 As I have                        reported the specifics of that statement were added at the last minute and                        obviously for the reasons just mentioned3 I have already discussed the letter to Brezhnev It and the instructions to youDocuments 217 and 218 I showed and discussed with                            Haig I was not surprised by                        your reaction to the message of instructions but as you have frequently                        said you need to know the Presidents mood and what he is thinking That                        message of instructions conveyed far better than any description I could                        have given his mood of the moment as I tried to indicate in the                        introductory paragraph with which I forwarded the instructions Had I                        substantially modified the instructions that whole flavor would have been

SC resolution and ceasefire in                        Jordan and that so far as its forces in Syria are concerned they are under                        Syrian commandIn telegram Tohak 102 October 22

accept a ceasefire                            He stated that he was determined that the Iraqis would not be allowed to                            pass through Jordanian lines at the front or through Jordanian                            territory Hussein felt however                            that he could not pull his troops out of Syria at that time nor remove                            them from Syrian command Therefore if Asad did not accept the ceasefire he would announce                            that although Jordan itself supported the ceasefire the Jordanian                            troops in Syria would remain under Syrian command Ibid Kissinger Office Files Box 39                                Kissinger Trip Files HAK TripMoscow Tel Aviv London TOHAK                            61123 Oct 2023 1973 I argued long with King that this is                        not acceptable what he is doing is letting his policy be determined by                        Syria which in turn could be basing its policy on a nonacceptance in                        past of 242 and 2 presence of Iraqi forces It would be ironic and                        nonunderstandable in history for Jordan to enter Syria with its forces in                        order to thwart Iraqis and then have its policy on ME peace determined by those Iraqis I also said that I                        understood that military plans of Syrians called for SyrianIraqiJordanian                        attack at dawn Said Jordanian participation in such attack a few hours                        after ceasefire could be disaster for us all2 I asked King to phone Assad once more and try to get better understanding                        from him Said I assumed that Soviets in touch with Assad in as much as                            Sadat has already announced that                        Soviets had contacted him Seemed to me that Assad owed King some info3 Cannot tell what effect this had King and later Hassan took it all in                        They both feel like pawns in an immensely large chess game where no one has                        told them what the rules are4 I suspect King will do nothing at this moment but await Syrian                        Governments announcement He suggested we get in touch later this                        evening5 As I left I reiterated one point: for Gods sake do not let your army                        get into a fruitless attack tomorrow morning and have the wrath of the world                        descend on

of                            Cox and the resulting resignation                        of Richardson and Ruckelshaus Because the situation is at a                        stage of white heat the ramifications of the accomplishments in Moscow have                        been somewhat eclipsed and their true significance underplayed For this                        reason it is essential that you participate fully in maintaining the                        national perspective and that a major effort be made to refocus national                        attention on the Presidents role in the Middle East settlement An                        impeachment stampede could well develop in the Congress tomorrow although we                        are confident that cooler heads will prevail if the Presidents assets are                        properly appliedAs of now the President believes that it is essential that we have a                        bipartisan leadership meeting tomorrow at the White House during which you                        can report in detail on the Middle East situation lacing this report with                        heavy emphasis on the Presidents accomplishments

considered this to be merely an                            exercise The IDF judged that Syria                            did not yet feel able to occupy the Golan Heights thus it considered                            the Syrian deployment a defensive one In summary the IDF was keeping a close watch on both                            fronts but there were no indications of IDF mobilization or

      consultations he found growing concern with new equipment entering Arab                        inventories from Soviet Union and West Dinitz stressed that Arabs have theoretical capability to                        attack all Israeli population centers either with aircraft or with missiles                        including Soviet supplied Scud Dinitz argued that US and Israel should examine motivation                        for Soviet upgrading of Arab capabilities and see what this means for spirit                        of dtente He added that Israel must also consider how escalation affects                        Israeli arms requirements and recalled that Israeli requests for US                        smart bombs and number of other items were still outstanding Sisco thanked Dinitz for presentation and withheld comment pending study                        of points raised2 Dinitz saidApparent omission in the original That while he                        was in Israel he had found greater concern about military situation than he                        had anticipated Israel sees escalation in both numbers and types of weapons                        Arab states now receiving Soviet                        Union no longer has monopoly since Western arms now flowing in Dinitz felt this makes weird combination                        Soviets finding it necessary to escalate their arms shipments to maintain                        commitment of their Arab clients in face unlimited financial resources of                        some Arab countries and unlimited willingness of Western country like France                        to sell arms Thus Arab inventories contain Sukois Tupulovs MIGs and                        Mirages and boast SAM Twos Sixes and in                        Syria and Egypt FROG missiles FROG is more dangerous in Syria than in                        Egypt since range does not carry Egyptian FROGs out of Sinai but Syrian                        FROGs can reach suburbs of Haifa Dinitz said Israel believes Egyptians and Syrians may now                        have more sophisticated missile in Soviet Scud3 Dinitz said new Arab equipment                        transformed military picture by giving Arabs strategic attack capability                        Arabs now have at least theoretical capability for lowlevel penetration                        raids With Sukoi 20 and new configuration of Mirage 5 Arabs can fly under                        Israeli radar net and reach population centers With these planes plus                        missiles like FROG 7 and Scud Arabs have                        capability to hit practically every population center in Israel4 Dinitz said Israel had to regard                        this as very grave development which raised two problems First is how                        Soviet supplies fit into entire picture of dtente and what Soviet interest                        is in upgrading capabilities of equipment being provided to Arabs Question                        is whether Soviets are simply reacting to escalation of weapons being                        provided to Arabs by West or if it represents policy of deeper Soviet                        penetration in Persian Gulf Israel wonders how this fits in with spirit of                        dtente in world and feels this possibly area for joint USIsraeli                        evaluation5 Dinitz said second problem was how                        Israel should rearm itself to meet this change in balance New equipment                        does not represent upset in balance but does represent change and this is                        trend which must be watched closely This particularly true of Scud missile                        which is introduction of comparatively new element in balance6 Dinitz said he did not want go into                        formal presentation of what this all means in terms Israeli equipment needs                        Fortunately difficult hurdle of agreement on planes is now behind US and                        Israel But there are still many requests pending Dinitz did not want go into details                        equipment outstanding but noted it included number types of bombs which had                        high degree of accuracy in hitting target He added some requests have been                        pending for over year Dinitz                        reiterated his statement this was not formal presentation on these                        outstanding items but had to be mentioned since analysis would not be                        complete without this information7 Dinitz added Israeli analysts now                        convinced Saudi Arabia has sealed agreement with France for Mirage aircraft                            Sisco said US had heard deal                        was for 38 or 39 aircraft but US cannot say deal is firm US asked Saudis for explanation and did not                        receive satisfactory reply Sisco                        added that if Israel has firm information on this it would be helpful to                        pass it on to us Though US may have no doubts as to accuracy of rumors                        there is no way to prove allegation Dinitz promised to pass on any info he could get and said                        this concluded his presentation8 Sisco thanked Dinitz for presentation and said US would                        study points Dinitz raised before attempting

Document                            361 You may confirm to the Shah and Prime Minister that as of Sept 24 the                            USSR has delivered 14 rpt 14 TU22 Blinder medium bombers to Iraq                        This is the first export of this aircraft to nonSoviet forces It is                        understood that this is the result of an agreement reached in early 1973                        between the two countries It is further understood that Iraqi pilots have                        received training in these aircraft in the USSR since midsummer2 Following data on TU22s may be useful to you: aircraft entered service                        in 1962 It has supersonic dash capability of Mach 18 and combat ceiling of                        47600 ft Bomb load is 6600 lb3 It is possible that the deal may have originated in the summer of 1972                        after the Soviets were expelled from Egypt At that time the Soviets made a                        special effort to court Syria and Iraq and as a result Iraq signed a treaty                        of friendship and cooperation with the USSR it seems safe to assume that as a result of signing this                        treaty Iraq got promises of new arms deliveries from the USSR4 It should be noted that Iraqs attitude toward the West and toward its                        neighbors has changed considerably in the meantime Iraq has improved its                        relations with Western Europe considerably has begun trading again with US                        firms two large contracts for Boeing Aircraft and with Brown and Root for an oil terminal have                        been signed recently and has                        moderated its position with regards to its immediate neighbors Kuwait in                        particular5 We recognize however that Iraqi policy has been erratic and that TU22s                        and other recent Soviet arms deliveries give Iraq added military potential                        We will accordingly be keeping situation under careful reviewRush	19731004frus1969-76v27d236	236 Telegram From the Interests Section in Baghdad to the

admission that 12 HawkerHunters are in Egypt to engage the enemy2 These actions show considerable ingenuity in exploiting war situation to                        serve Iraqi interests Given Iraqs isolation from other Arabs and the                        battlefields a dramatic act was required to demonstrate its continuing role                        as avant garde revolutionary Nationalization of last remaining US                        investment was natural choice given regimes conviction that Israels                        strength and militancy are result of US backing Partial nationalization                        is not new idea and Dept will recall it                        was raised as possibility just prior to IPC                        settlement Even though

exports to US fits in same                        category but has little pratical importance in immediate future3 Regimes offer of rapprochement with Iran in name of Muslim solidarity and                        in order to devote full energies to battle confirms in my view that Iraq                        has been working hard for rapprochement but was unable to make new moves                        without losing face in view of Iranian disinterestedness and disdainful                        public utterance of Shah about Baghdad regime Real reason for seeking                        rapprochement remains that it is prerequisite to resolving Kurdish                        problem4 Comment: With possible exception nationalization                        which hard pressed Baath

CONVOCATION                            OF A WORLD FOOD CONFERENCE UNDER THE AUSPICES OF THE UNITED NATIONS WAS                            INSCRIBED ON THE UNGA AGENDA AND                            ASSIGNED TO SECOND COMMITTEE ECONOMIC FINANCIAL WE WILL REQUEST                            SECOND COMMITTEE TO REFER ITEM TO 55TH SESSION OF ECOSOC WHICH WILL MEET IN RESUMED

CALLING FOR THE                            HOLDING OF A WFC UNDER UN AUSPICES AT A GIVEN TIME AND PLACE THE                            RESOLUTION WOULD CONTAIN GENERAL TERMS OF REFERENCE FOR THE CONFERENCE 4 PURPOSE: THE GENERAL PURPOSE WOULD BE TO EXPLORE DESIRABILITY AND                            FEASIBILITY OF VARIOUS MEASURES OF INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION TO COPE                            WITH WORLDWIDE PROBLEMS WHICH COULD ARISE FROM POSSIBLE SERIOUS                            IMBALANCES IN SUPPLY AND DEMAND FOR FOOD INCLUDING THOSE CAUSED BY                            WIDESPREAD CROP FAILURE INCREASING PRESSURE ON FOOD SUPPLIES RESULTING                            FROM POPULATION GROWTH AND RISING INCOMES AND THE FAILURE OF DEVELOPING                            COUNTRIES AS A WHOLE TO INCREASE FOOD PRODUCTION RAPIDLY ENOUGH TO                            IMPROVE OVERALL NUTRITIONAL LEVELS PURPOSE WOULD ALSO INCLUDE SIMILAR                            EXPLORATION WITH REGARD TO INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION TO IMPROVE DISASTER                            RELIEF FOR LOCALIZED EMERGENCIES WE HOPE THAT THE CONFERENCE CAN                            EXAMINE SERIOUSLY IDEAS AND INITIATIVES WHICH ARE ALREADY BEING                            DEVELOPED AS WELL AS ANY NEW PROPOSALS WHICH MAY BE PUT FORWARD5 WE ARE DEVELOPING SPECIFIC IDEAS CONCERNING THE AGENDA FOR THE                            CONFERENCE AND PLAN TO CONSULT WITH MAJOR FOOD PRODUCING AND IMPORTING                            COUNTRIES PRIOR TO OFFERING AN APPROPRIATE DRAFT RESOLUTION FOR UNGA

               AND FACILITIES NECESSARY FOR PREPARING THE CONFERENCE ON THE OTHER                            HAND THE SOVIET UNION IS NOT A MEMBER OF FAO ACCORDINGLY THE WFC                            SHOULD BE HELD UNDER UN AUSPICES BUT WE WOULD PREFER THAT THE FAO                            SECRETARIAT PARTICIPATE IN A MAJOR WAY IN PREPARING FOR THE CONFERENCE                            THIS

REPRESENTATION: WE BELIEVE THAT THE CONFERENCE WOULD HAVE                            GREATEST IMPACT IF IT WERE HELD AT THE MINISTERIAL LEVEL IT SHOULD BE                            MADE CLEAR THAT WE
