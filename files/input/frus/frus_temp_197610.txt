following personal message from President Ford to His Imperial Majesty Mohammad Reza Pahlavi:2 Begin text: Your Imperial Majesty: Your decision                        not to insist upon an oil price increase at the Bali OPEC meeting in May was an act of statesmanship which was important in                        determining the outcome of that meetingSee                                footnote 4 Document 175                        Avoidance of an oil price increase is of such great importance to the                        maintenance of the global economic recovery now underway that I am writing                        to request your continued constructive leadership in order to prevent such                        an increase3 I have been kept fully informed of your concern earlier this year that                        decreased oil exports would seriously affect Irans internal economic                        development and its ability to fulfill its role in the region I have                        carefully noted therefore that the increased economic activity associated                        with recovery in a number of oilimporting countries is reducing the                        difficulties which you had anticipated in financing Irans development and                        defense plans I am told that in the last four months Iranian crude                        production has averaged nearly six million barrels a day4 It now appears likely that the OPEC                        countries will earn 125 billion this year from their oil exports about 20                        more than in 1975 and more than 400 more than they earned in 1973 on a                        similar volume of oil exports In contrast our most careful analysis of the                        dollar prices of exports from the major industrialized countries to the oil                        producers indicates that these prices have risen by only 30 since mid1973                        and only 4 over the past year Prices for our largest exportgrainhave                        actually fallen wheat prices averaged 150 per ton in the first half of                        this year compared to 200 per ton in 19745 The progress of industrialized countries in controlling inflation through                        major policy actions has been dramatic considering all circumstances with                        the average rate of inflation for major countries now standing at half the                        1974 rate In the United States prices are rising at about 6 annually                        compared with 12 in 1974 It is likewise encouraging that certain                        oilimporting developing countries have begun to narrow their current                        account deficits in 1976 as a result of reduced inflation rising exports                        and improved terms of trade However the balance of payments situation of                        many countries remains critical while that of less fortunate energy                        deficient developing countries is truly desperate Many countries have in                        fact virtually reached the end of their ability to borrow6 My deep concern which I bring to your attention in the spirit of our                        close relationship is that the favorable trends toward economic recovery                        will be reversed by the negative inflationary and balance of payments                        effects of a new increase in the price of oil Several important                        industrialized countries which are experiencing economic difficulties and                        the attendant danger of political instability would encounter still more                        severe economic problems if faced next year with a new oil price increase Similarly the energy deficient                        developing nations would suffer additional damage to their prospects for                        economic growth and a further erosion of their already weak borrowing                        ability This would add major new strains to the international financial                        system and intensify pressure on both industrialized and oilproducing                        nations to provide balance of payments support Thus the fragile and uneven                        nature of the global economic recovery requires that responsible nations                        avoid action which would endanger it7 Secretary Kissinger reported fully                        to me on his talks with you last August and noted your concern about the                        need to maintain close cooperation between our two countries despite                        opposition in Congress and other circlesSee                                Document 183 As the Secretary told                        you this administration is determined to continue to assist your nation in                        developing its military establishment and meeting its goals for economic                        development and to cooperate with Iran in seeking solutions to major                        regional and worldwide economic and political problems I am sure you have                        been fully informed of the administrations successful resistance to                        Congressional attempts to block the sale of F16 aircraft and other military                        equipment to Iran The struggle with certain segments of American opinion on                        this subject has by no means been won however and I fear that there will                        be further and perhaps greater pressures next year By working together we                        can overcome these pressures and solidify the close relationship between our                        two countries However Iranian support for an OPEC decision to increase the price of oil at this time would                        play directly into the hands of those who have been attacking our                        relationship8 The determination to strengthen the cooperation between important                        producing and consuming nations which you and I share is not universal                        And yet this cooperation and that between the developing and developed                        worlds is a key element in the pursuit of the global political and economic                        stability which will allow all nations to achieve better lives for their                        peoples I believe that further progress in a number of areas of the                        NorthSouth relationship including the official development assistance made                        available to the developing world should be possible in the coming months                        Your resistance to a further increase in the price of oil could be a                        significant influence in restraining the growth of pressures which threaten                        to divert us from the path of positive achievement in this important                        area9 Given this situation I believe that the outcome of the December OPEC meeting will have far reaching economic                        and political consequences Your Imperial Majestys personal stature and                        Irans position of international leadership provide an opportunity for a                        historically important contribution                        to political stability economic prosperity and cooperation beneficial to                        Iran and to all nations I therefore urge Your Imperial Majesty to give                        these concerns serious and positive consideration in making your decision on                        this matter Sincerely Gerald R                            FordEnd text10 The above letter should be dated October 29 1976Kissinger	19761030

Ref: Pretoria 4458Document                                2131 You should get hold of Fourie                            and convey to him following response from Secretary to Ian Smith:2 Dear Mr Smith: I have just                            received your message in which you express your concern about the                            situation which has developed in the aftermath of your courageous public                            declaration I can understand your concern and I appreciate the fact                            that you have remained steadfast in the face of the difficulties which                            have arisen We are aware of the pressures under which you are                            operating3 I must stress however that we reject the proposition that we forced                            you into making the announcement which you made on September 24See Document                                209 It was clear to me from our discussions in                                PretoriaSee Document 206 that you understood as I do the                            realities which Rhodesia faces are the compelling reasons behind your                            decision It is my firm judgment that had you not taken the wise                            decision the objective facts in one year would have compelled you to                            seek a settlement under worse circumstances Our offer gave an                            opportunitybut not a guaranteefor a moderate solution I want to                            repeat what I told you in Pretoria If you prefer to fight rather than                            to negotiate the decision is up to you Whichever course you choose will                            have no consequence for the United States I must remind you however                            that you can expect no help from us4 I share your concerns about the radicals It may well be their                            strategy as well as that of the Soviets to delay the convening of the                            conference and the installation of moderate African leadership in order                            to improve their military position We should not allow that strategy to                            succeed and the best way to do so is to insure that an interim                            government under moderate leadership is installed rapidly5 We did not know the Angolan Prime Minister would be present at the                            Lusaka meetingSee footnote 2 Document 213 and were as surprised as                            you Nor did we appreciate the rhetoric used in Lusaka I have made it                            clear to the frontline presidents that certain of the public statements                            made in other African capitals have not contributed to progress towards                            a negotiated settlement It is important however to remember that the                            frontline presidents have their own political constituents6 In our judgment the way to a negotiated settlement is open We have                            studied carefully the statements which the presidents made in Lusaka                            There has been no significant rejection of the five points Nor in                            fact has there been a conclusive rejection of the two ministries being                            held by the Europeans7 We believe that the final shape of an interim government will emerge                            in a manner much more acceptable to you through direct discussions with                            the Rhodesian nationalists than if we and the British try to negotiate                            the subject with the frontline presidents before the conference begins                            As you know the British with our strong support are moving quickly to                            call the conference They have done this on the understanding that this                            was something you thought would be helpful8 It is in all of our interests to organize rapidly a meeting which                            will set up an interim government The Rhodesian nationalists who wish                            to participate in the interim government have different purposes I                            suggest you defer your judgment on the positions they will take until we                            have a chance to see what proposals they will put forward9 If we are to continue to be helpful we cannot do so unless the                            misrepresentations and press leaks cease immediately Newsweek has given me a report based on Salisbury sources of                            my conversations in Pretoria The Newsweek                            article is highly tendentious and misleading10 Assistant Secretary Schaufele accompanied by Rowlands will come to Salisbury in the next few days                            and go through in greater detail our perception of the settlement They                            will share with you and your colleagues our assessment In our view the                            essence of point 3 in the proposals we advanced to you can form the                            basis for a solution11 I look forward to hearing from you further after Assistant Secretary                                Schaufele has had an                            opportunity to share with you my views Best regards Henry A KissingerKissinger	19761001

                         Conference: Discussion with Smith Ref: State 264172Document 2161 Ian Smith accompanied only by                            his private secretary received me at 12:30 local time and read slowly                            and carefully the written message which I delivered He took immediate issue with the sentence                            which reads subsequently after consultations with the UK and the African presidents you were                            informed that these two issues would be difficult but perhaps manageable                            and could be included as modifications of the original five points2 While he did not want to pick a fight with the United States Smith                            argued forcefully and returned to the point frequently during our                            meeting that the message of assurance he had received through our                            Ambassador and his representative in Pretoria was quite categorical and                            did not have the same meaning Without our message of assurance that the                            Africans had accepted the five points he would not have attempted to                            sell his acceptance to the Cabinet or his people During the                            conversation he repeated several times that this exercise would never                            have begun without Secretary Kissingers assurances as contained in the message from                            Pretoria3 Smith said that he had the                            message with him in Geneva and could substantiate his point if                            necessary He did not say or give the impression that he planned to take                            the extreme step of making it public John Snell told me after the                            meeting he wanted to send to me the text of the message as Smith received it from Pretoria                                Smith stated that we must                            try to clear this up and that he would be most upset if it were thought                            that he had misrepresented Dr Kissinger4 I then asked Smiths                            permission to complete my oral instructions which he accepted calmly and                            stonefaced He regretted the public discussion of Annex C but felt he                            had been driven to mention it because Richard had referred to Annex C so                            frequently in his meeting of Oct 23 and had made clear to Smith that he regarded it and not the                            five points as the document under negotiationIn telegram 8348 from Geneva October 25 the                                Mission reported on the meeting between Richard and Smith Richard stated the British                                regarded Annex C as a reasonable basis and would do what we could                                to achieve it He noted that the British Government could not                                however be committed to all details without negotiations                                    Ford Library

9Smith said that in their first                            meeting Richard had almost poohpoohed the five points and had said                            we are working to Annex C By the second meeting Smith said Richard                            had changed his tune somewhat and had said that the British would try                            to work with the five principles He had also been forced to mention                            Annex C because he understood from his press officers that the British                            had leaked the fact of its existence to the press His delegation had                            received inquiries from reporters who said the British had done so In                            short he had been forced into his position by the antics of the                            British5 Smiths defense was not logical I told him that the first we had                            heard about the press interest in Annex C was after his press                            conference I also told him that while I could not speak for the British                            I understood the British were giving the five points a hard run with the                            Africans and would wish at an appropriate time in the negotiations to                            work for the best outcome possible drawing from everything available                            including Annex C I reiterated that we view the difference between the                            two documents as his margin of safety which he must do all necessary to                            defend6 His only other comment on the instructed oral points was his defense                            of his speaking out in public and to the press He had to reassure his                            people on the issues of the conference He laid great emphasis on the                            need to not lose his support at home If the people feel he had lied to                            them hed be laughed out of office If I dont reply when the British                            claim I misrepresent the understandings then I had better get out of my                            present job If white Rhodesians become upset we will lose them                            Our lives are at stake we must be careful I told Smith we did not question legitimate                            selfdefense but saw no reason in his discussing detailed negotiating                            positions and issues in public I urged specifically to make no further                            reference to Annex C7 Smith returned to the                            categorical nature of the Secretarys assurances which he described as a                            firm contract and said only our word had convinced the Rhodesian                            people that the presidents would stand by the agreement as they                            promised He said I could only convince my colleagues by assuring them                            of Dr Kissingers prestige and                            power and the power of the United States as the greatest nation I told                                Smith as a personal                            observation that as a man with long African negotiating experience he                            must accept the fact that the five points are a political and not a                            legal document He said he appreciated this point but feared the                            negotiations were heading for the same fate as those which took place at                            Victoria Falls where the African nationalists went back on categorical                            agreements that had been reached between Vorster and the African Presidents He said I hope I am                            wrong but we may be heading in that direction I urged steadiness and                            repeated the Secretarys appreciation for his difficult position and our                            willingness to work with him Smith reciprocated and urged I transmit                            his sincere regrets for the misunderstandings9 Smith was off balance and defensive throughout the meeting His                            justification for mentioning Annex C was not convincingCatto	19761027

your request following is text of Annex C with Rogers added para 10                            as of September 12 1976 which is the currently operative textRhodesia: Possible Constitutional Arrangements for the Period of                            Transition1 It is postulated that:A Any interim administration must be legalized by the British                            GovernmentB Britain would appoint a British Government representative in                            Salisbury2 In British domestic law Rhodesia remains a British colony and the                            Queen as Queen of the United Kingdom is the sovereign of the                            territory This would remain the legal position until the time came to                            grant independence3 In order to legalize the situation in Rhodesia following agreement on                            a constitutional settlement it would be necessary for the British                            Parliament to pass a new act The 1965 Southern Rhodesia Act does not                            confer powers to suspend or revoke the Rhodesian constitution of 1961 or                            to amend that constitution out of all recognition But the 1961                            constitution would not provide an appropriate framework for the period                            of transition4 The new act would be an enabling instrument ie it would empower the                            British Government to impose constitutional change in Rhodesia by orders                            in Council which would probably have to be subject to an affirmative                            resolution by both houses of the British Parliament A bill to enact an                            amendment to the 1965 legislation could not be introduced in the British                            Parliament until it reassembles in midOctober unless it were to be                            recalled earlier for that special purpose5 It would in any case take time to prepare the necessary consequential                            legislation One major technical problem is posed by the need to                            determine which of the postUDI                            enactments of the Rhodesian Parliament should be retrospectively                            validated and which should be annulled or amended It would also be                            necessary to provide for a political amnesty which would on the one hand free                            political detainees and prisoners from Rhodesian restraints and on the                            other protect members of the administration against prosecution or                            civil suit for past illegal actsLegislative and Executive Authority in Rhodesia6 The new act would have to vest legislative and executive authority                            within Rhodesia in local organs of government We envisage the formation                            of a two tier system comprising a Council of State and a Council of                            Ministers and providing for internal checks and balances designed as                            far as possible to be selfregulating and to obviate the need for the                            British Parliament to intervene in the Government of Rhodesia during the                            transitional period7 While the form of any interim administration would be partly a matter                            for the British Parliament its composition would be a matter for                            decision by the Rhodesians themselves The responsibility for choosing                            the members of the Council of State and of the Council of Ministers must                            lie in Rhodesia even though the formal appointment of members of the                            former will have to be made by the Queen of the United Kingdom At the                            same time the allocation of responsibilities set out below must be                            based on the assumption that the members of the organs of government                            during the interim period would by and large have been chosen from                            among those who genuinely subscribed to or acquiesced in the aim of a                            rapid and orderly transition of majority ruleThe Council of State8 For the Council of State we could envisage the following:I Composition: The Council would be composed of between 5 to 7 members                            with a predetermined ratio which would have to be maintained                            throughout between the European and the African members The members of                            the Council would elect their own Chairman He would be primus inter                            pares and would have no special status The ratio of membership could be                            3 to 2 or 4 to 3 in favor of the Africans or there could be parity but                            in that event it would be laid down that the Chairman of the Council                            would be AfricanII Appointment of members: By the Queen of the United Kingdom formally                            acting on the advice of her Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs but                            the latter would have no power of choice: he would endorse local                            Rhodesian choicesA The composition of the first Council of State would be decided in the                            course of negotiations between the European caretaker government and the                            African nationalists In the event that they were unable to reach                            consensus the European and African sides would both have the right to                            nominate the number of representatives to which they were respectively                            entitled Neither side could veto the choice of the other: all those nominated would have                            to take an oath binding themselves to work for a rapid and orderly                            transition to majority rule An additional safeguard and this would                            point to a 7rather than a 5 or 6 man Council would be to provide that                            the Europeans and Africans would have the right to nominate one member                            of the other raceB Subsequent appointments would be by cooption requiring at least a                            twothirds majority The only proviso would be that a departing member                            must be replaced by someone of the same race or that where a departing                            member had been initially nominated by the other side the choice of the                            replacement would lie solely with the members of that other sideIII Voting: The decisions of the Council would normally be taken by                            consensus: where a vote was necessary at least a twothirds majority                            should be required except that a decision to dismiss the Chief Minister                            or the Chief of Staff of the armed forces would have to be                            unanimousIV Legislative authority: Full legislative authority would be vested in                            the Council: it alone would have power to enact primary legislation                            though it could delegate its powers in respect of subordinate                            legislation to the Council of Ministers or to individual ministers                            Responsibility for initiating proposals for legislation would rest with                            the Council of Ministers though in the spheres mentioned in V A                            below the Council of State would have power to amend the formers                            proposals and elsewhere to suggest amendments These latter would stand                            unless overriden by a vote of a predetermined size in the Council of                            MinistersV Executive powers:A The Council of State would have ultimate authority in matters related                            to the implementation of the programme for progress to majority rule and                            see also VI below to defense and internal security In both spheres                            it could issue directives to the Council of Ministers to individual                            ministers or to officialsB It would have the right to be kept informed of the proceedings of the                            Council of Ministers one possibility would be to arrange for a joint                            secretariat to service both CouncilsC The Council would be responsible for the appointments and dismissal of                            all members of the Council of Ministers at its discretion alone other                            appointments and dismissals and the allocation of portfolios would                            however be made only after consultation with the Chief Minister whose                            advice would be bindingD The Council would also be responsible for the appointment and                            dismissal of: members of the judiciary whose dismissal would however                            be subject to the usual safeguards the chiefs of the armed forces and of the police and the                            senior members down to a grade to be determined of the public                            serviceE The Council would also exercise the prerogative of mercyThe Council of Ministers9 For the Council of Ministers we could envisage the following:I Appointment of members: See paragraph 8 IV C aboveII Composition: The Council would be composed of a Chief Minister who                            would be an African and would contain a majority of African                            membersIII Voting: Normally under the doctrine of collective responsibility                            no vote ought to be necessary but where there was a clear division of                            opinion it might be necessary to provide for a vote to be taken In                            such an event it would be important to ensure that a mere majority did                            not suffice for that could theoretically lead to a situation in which                            the European members were permanently outvoted One possibility would be                            to provide for a two thirds majority to be required as the norm and                            where this could not be achieved for the decision to lie with the                            Council of StateIV The quorum: It would be necessary to make provision for a quorum                            perhaps of a least half of the African and half of the European                            membersV The Councils business: The initiative for proposing the agenda would                            lie with the Chief Minister but every member of the Council would be                            entitled to propose items for agenda and should have the right to insist                            on their being discussedThe British Role10 The organs of government would have authority for a predetermined                            period perhaps not exceeding two years11 Britain would remain responsible for external affairs during the                            interim period and there would be a British Government representative in                            Salisbury He would not be a representative of the Queen His function                            would be quasidiplomatic: to monitor the programme of progress to                            majority rule and where necessary to make available his good offices                            to mediate in any matter affecting the carrying through of the                            programmeRobinson	19761027

international energy                        policy making and IEA Note: For Tokyo: We have already discussed text with Kinoshita                            MITI and Karita Gaimusho at CIEC meeting in Paris4 Begin text: At its meeting on November 89 the                        Governing Board is scheduled to take a formal decision on the process and                        timetable for establishing objectives for the reduction of IEA dependence on imported oil The United                        States considers this decision and the process it will launch to be of fundamental importance                        to the viability and future effectiveness of industrialized country                        cooperation in energyThe updated version of the OECDs LongTerm                        Energy Assessment and similar studies by other sources project a total                        world demand for OPEC oil in 1985 of at                        least 40 MMBD on the basis of the energy                        policies now in place in our countries and relatively conservative                        assumptions for our economic growth In the US view the degree of vulnerability to unilateral oil price                        increases and threats of supply interruptions which such dependency would                        entail is clearly unacceptableThere are of course several reasons why industrialized country consumption                        will probably never reach these projected levels First it is very doubtful                        that OPEC would be willing or able to                        produce that much oil by 1985: OPEC                        surplus production capacity has declined and while a few countries most                        notably Saudi Arabia have the potential to increase capacity to meet the                        projected demand we cannot assume they will choose to do so particularly                        since as they have stated repeatedly their revenues at present production                        levels far exceed even their projected future financial requirementsOf more immediate significance however is the fact that as our demand for                            OPEC oil increases during the short                        term future the real price of oil will almost certainly increase either as                        a result of OPECs monopolistic                        exploitation of our vulnerability or simply because of the operation of                        traditional market forces Whichever the reason if present trends continue                        the resulting higher costs for energy within our economies will have a                        significant adverse impact on economic growth As a result our actual                        demand for oil over the medium and longterm probably will be held to levels                        considerably lower than projected But there is little cause for comfort in                        such an assessment when we consider the economic costs to our societies and                        to the world economy generally of such a reduced growth scenarioThere is however an alternative to this profoundly worrying forecast for                        the future: An alternative which hopefully will ensure a continued                        satisfactory increase in our economic growth while at the same time                        avoiding the dangers of the boomandbust energy use patterns just                        described But this will come about only if we act quickly to improve the                        efficiency of our energy consumption and develop our own sources of energy                        so as to bring about a more acceptable longterm global balance of supply                        and demand for energy Current studies indicate that the implementation of a                        series of more vigorous energy policies could reduce the demand of the                            OECD countries for imported oil in                        1985 by as much as one third Whether or not a swing of this magnitude in                        our requirements for imported oil would be feasible cannot at this point be determined However it is                        essential that we begin now to determine:how much of a change in our combined requirements for imported oil is both                        possible and practical given essential economic social and other goals                        andhow individual IEA countries operating                        within our cooperative framework and taking account of individual economic                        and social goals and diverse levels of resource endowment and patterns of                        energy use can contribute to this shift in the global energy balanceBearing in mind the preliminary discussions on this subject which have                        already taken place in the IEA the US believes several key points concerning                        issues and procedures have emerged which should be endorsed by the Governing                        Board at its next meeting:First it is clear that each individual country must retain sole control                        over its own energy decisions: An exercise in which supranational decisions                        are imposed on governments is not envisioned However the assessment of the                        current and potential performance of individual countries must be a mutual                        one This is a further step towards the necessary interlocking although not                        the integration of our national energy programs In the end we must each                        be satisfied that the acceptance of responsibility for contributing to the                        desired shift in our collective energy balance reflects equitable sharing of                        costs and benefitsSecond we need a quantitative group objective for reduced dependency                        supported by individual country acceptance of responsibility for meeting                        their fair share of that objective including the concrete policy measures                        that will be required For its part the US                        could itself envision accepting a quantified national reduced dependency                        objective expressed in terms of millions of barrels of imported oil by 1985                        Other countries may choose to express their share of responsibility for                        meeting the groups target in a different manner Regardless of the specific                        method chosen however it should provide a quantifiable standard against                        which individual country performance can be measured The sum of all of                        these individual national commitments when expressed in terms of quantified                        impact on oil consumption for the group should be able to be described in                        terms of a projected import dependency objective for the group as a                        wholeThird national commitments to these objectives must be credible and of a                        roughly parallel nature This is a difficult issue in view of the                        differences among our various governmental systems The US would envision a process of political                        undertakings not legally binding commitments However we have already                        begun the process of consulting with the US                        Congress concerning the establishment of the USnational objective within the                            IEA in order to help ensure that the                        goal chosen is a national goal with Congressional support for the                        concomitant policy measures required to reach it The review of national                        performance through the IEAs annual review                        procedures would ensure that there is parallelism in the carrying out of                        such national commitmentsAnd fourth the establishment of these objectives and their regular review                        in terms of actual performance must take place at the policymaking not the                        technical level within the IEA and                        national governments themselves Therefore we believe that while initial                        development of these objectives would be done at Governing Board levels                        their formal establishment and the ultimate enunciation of the political                        commitments underlying them should take place at the Ministerial levelThe US believes that the process paper                        circulated recently by the SLT Chairman is                        generally consonant with the US position                        outlined above We would agree however with the statement by Chairman                            Davignon at the last Governing                        Board meeting GB 76 38 Add1The text of Davignons statement was transmitted in telegram 31468                            from USOECD Paris October 25                            Ibid that although the evaluation of government measures is                        always a difficult exercise such evaluation and the development of                        yardsticks are unavoidable The US believes                        such yardsticks must be quantitative in nature and that the process                        adopted by the IEA should make this clear                        We therefore believe an additional step should be inserted between steps B                        and C of the present draft to read as follows:Countries may choose to express their share of responsibility for meeting                        the group target in different ways Regardless of the specific method                        chosen however it should provide a quantifiable standard against which                        individual country performance can be measured The sum of all of these                        individual national commitments when expressed in terms of quantified                        impact on oil consumption for the group should be able to be described in                        terms of a projected import dependency objective for the group as a                        wholeWith this amendment the US believes the                        process paper could serve as an appropriate basis for the development of                        an agreed IEA process for the establishment                        of reduced dependency objectives We strongly believe therefore that the                        Governing Board at its November 89 meeting should reach agreement along                        these lines and that the process described in the SLT Chairmans note for the articulation of the reduced dependency objectives should begin                        promptly thereafter End textAccording to telegram 33425 from USOECD Paris November 10 the IEA Governing Board took important step                            November 9 and adopted satisfactory decision to initiate process for                            establishing reduced dependence objectives by 1985 for IEA as proposed by Secretary Kissinger during last OECD Ministerial despite efforts by                            some delegations particularly UK to                            weaken exercise IbidRobinson	19761027

satisfactory global balance of energy supply and demand during and                        beyond the transition period will require major capital investment in the                        exploration development and utilization of new energy both conventional                        and nonconventional It is recognized that in order to create a climate                        more conducive to investment under mutually satisfactory conditions                        international cooperation on a continuing basis should be intensified2 The industrialized countries recognize the need to facilitate investment                        in the development of energy resources conventional and nonconventional                        in their own territories and in the developing countries commensurate with                        the urgent need to assure adequate world energy supplies In this regard                        they recognize the need to maintain and improve access to capital markets by                        the developing countries3 The oil exporting countries recognize the need to take account of the                        worlds requirements for energy and in particular requirements for oil and                        gas during the transition period in formulating their plans for investment                        in new production capacity and supporting infrastructure4 The participating countries recognize that the accelerated development of                        the indigenous energy resources conventional and nonconventional of the                        energy deficient developing countries is essential to the economic progress                        of these countries This development will require major amounts of capital                        The industrialized and oil exporting countries to a greater or lesser                        extent are the primary sources of such capital5 Participating countries recognize the important role the private sector                        plays in providing much of the capital as well as much of the technology                        and knowhow for the exploration and development of the energy resources of                        the energy deficient developing countries It is also recognized that in                        order to facilitate the flow of such capital into energy resource                        development in the EDDCs unnecessary constraints should be reduced In this                        respect cooperation agreements between investing and host countries could                        be appropriate in some cases Foreign investment should be consistent with                        the needs of the host countries and make an optimum contribution to the                        fulfillment of their economic development plans6 The Energy Commission conducted a preliminary examination of the proposal                        to establish an International Resources Bank to facilitate investment in raw                        materials including energy in developing countries with particular                        attention to its potential to facilitate increased investment in energy                        development in the energy deficient developing countries The participating                        countries welcome the recent decision by the IBRDIMF Development Committee                        to study the International Resources Bank proposal and suggest that the                        Development Committees examination                        of the proposal take account of the urgent need of many developing countries                        to reduce their dependence on imported energy7 It is also recognized that the official international lending institutions                        have played and will continue to play an important role in the development                        of indigenous energy resources in the energy deficient developing countries                        Participating countries recommend that these institutions in the context of                        their overall development lending activities recognize the urgency of the                        energy investment requirements including infrastructure of such                        countriesEnd textKatz	19761029

PROGRESS AS RAPIDLY AS                            POSSIBLE AND THAT CREDIBILITY OF THE PROGRAM WOULD BE CONSIDERABLY                            ENHANCED BY A FIRM COMMITMENT BY USG TO                            DEFEND THE PHILIPPINES AGAINST EXTERNAL AGGRESSION2 WITH REGARD TO THE QUESTION OF THE SPRATLY ISLANDS ROMULO SAID HE WAS AWARE THIS                            WOULD HAVE SOME BEARING ON USG

INTENTION OF INVOLVING THE UNITED                            STATES IN THE RESOLUTION OF THE SPRATLYS QUESTION BECAUSE THE GOP FEELS IT CAN RESOLVE THE ISSUE ON THE                            BASIS OF

STATEMENT ON THOSE OUTLYING AREAS                            WOULD HAVE TO BE SO QUALIFIED AS TO BE NEARLY UNSATISFACTORY FROM GOP POINT OF VIEWS ROMULO RESPONDED BY

ON DRAGGING IN THE                            SPRATLYS WE WOULD HAVE TO INCLUDE COMPLICATED FORMULATIONS AND ESCAPE                            CLAUSES WHICH WOULD CAUSE MORE PROBLEMS THAN THEY SETTLED

A BILLION DOLLARS THE                            SECRETARY REPLIED THAT THIS WAS TOTALLY UNREALISTIC AND SUGGESTED THAT                            AS AN ALTERNATIVE THE GOP SHOULD ATTEMPT                            TO DEFINE ITS PRIORITIES IN TERMS OF EQUIPMENT WHICH HE WOULD THEN TRY                            TO SUPPLY ROMULO                            RESPONDED THAT ANOTHER WAY OF APPROACHING THE PROBLEM WOULD BE IN TERMS                            OF HOW IMPORTANT THE BASES REALLY ARE TO THE US THE SECRETARY REPLIED                            THAT IN AN ALLOUT WAR WE COULD DO WITHOUT THE
