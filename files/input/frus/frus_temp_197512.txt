pass to General Scowcroft White House Subj: Possible                        Change in Iranian Foreign Policy1 At audience on afternoon of December 30 Shah informed me that he was                        going to have to rethink Iranian foreign policy in light of significant                        revenue losses caused by dropoff in oil liftings of a million barrels per                            dayDIA                            Defense Intelligence Notice DIADIN 333875 December 19 noted that                            Irans dropoff in oil sales was due to its overpricing of heavy crude                            oil in a market depressed by unseasonably warm weather and the economic                            recession in the West Washington National Records Center OSD Files: FRC 330780058 Iran 300900                            1975 After pointing out that any foreign policy involved                        military and economic considerations as well as political ones the Shah                        explained that he cannot go on lending money to countries like Britain and                        France nor can he go on buying arms and civilian goods from the United                        States unless he has the revenue to make this possible Having identified                        the extent to which military power promotes political leverage in foreign                        affairs he said that Iran would be obliged to give up the idea of extending                        its influence outward and would be obliged to be entirely inwardlooking                        You and Saudi Arabia can handle the policing of the Indian Ocean he                        quipped He added that there was no possibility of naval patrolling as far                        as South Africa if indeed he is obliged to cancel the Spruance purchase and                        the development of a naval base at Chah Bahar which he is seriously                        considering doing I will be obliged to have a purely defensive navy The                        Shah ruled out military aid to                        other countries cf Lebanon but said he would not pull out of Dhofar since                        his commitment to Sultan Qaboos was firm The Shah went over in some detail                        the other military purchases he is intending to cancel including AWACS AMST the F16 and reducing the number of IHawk battalions now on order In summarizing                        the Shah emphasized that he would tailor his foreign policy objectives and                        his military purchases entirely to the income his country derives from                        oil2 At the conclusion of his comments involving the United States the Shah                        went on to say that since Britain and France were responsible for 60 percent                        of the oil takeoff from Iran he would be talking to those countries along                        the same lines that he had talked to me He said that it might be necessary                        to cancel weapons purchases from Britain cf Rapier Missile and he might                        be obliged to cancel understandings with France for building a subway system                        in Tehran and nuclear power plants in other parts of Iran3 During course of day December 30 three approaches were made to US                        officials here: the Shah spoke to me and General Toufanian Vice Minister of War and                        purchaser of all Iranian weapons systems spoke with both DefRep Von Marbod and me separately The message                        was exactly the same The application of pressure to increase oil liftings                        was clearAccording to telegrams 12136 and                            12152 from Tehran December 15 and 16 the Shah had argued for several                            weeks that with rising arms prices Iranian purchases could not proceed                            unless the United States prevailed upon oil companies to increase                            exports from Iran Ford Library National Security Adviser

oil companies were                            treating Iran better than most other Persian Gulf nations and that Iran                            was asking the United States to try to achieve indirectly what it knows                            it could not achieve directly: a reduction in liftings from Saudi Arabia                            to make more room in the market for Iranian oil Ibid                            D7504410496 Exactly what the Shah in the end will do is not so                        clear After 33 years in power he has endured much and has had many ups and                        downs He is essentially a pragmatist and is quite capable of making                        unpleasant decisions when he decides they are justified Therefore it would                        not be advisable for the USG to conclude                        that he is bluffing He is ambitious for his country he wants to improve                        the standard of living of his people and he desires a larger role for Iran                        on the world scene Nevertheless he is not consumed by his shiny goals and                        as he once said to me in another context The people of my country can                        always go back to subsisting on goat cheese as they did for centuries4 In light of the foregoing General Toufanians trip to Washington in midJanuary assumes                        additional importance and should not be postponed if it is at all possible                        to accommodate him The visit can have distinctly constructive aspects in bringing about                        reassurance on DOD performanceHelms	19751231

     with several key African leaders on Angola to explain our position and                            assure them of our continued resolve to oppose foreign intervention and                            to exchange views on ways by which the OAU might facilitate a negotiated settlement in Angola I                            said we wanted to consult with Mobutu as a first step and then reviewed with

                      Ambassadors from other African countries and would instruct them to make                            the same points to their respective host governments Mobutu expressed agreement with my                            presentation and satisfaction that we were taking such an initiative at                            this time3 With respect to our own efforts in Angola I said that despite                            problems with the Congress we remained determined to resist Soviet                            military intervention until a peaceful solution could be worked out I                            noted that the issue had by no means been played out in the Congress                            and if necessary the administration was prepared to renew the battle                            when Congress reconvenes next month For now however we have                            sufficient funds to meet present military requirements4 Mobutu said the Congress                            action posed serious problems both from the standpoint of limiting                            prospects for additional help and the adverse effect on the attitudes                            and will of others trying to help Of even greater concern he went on                            was the question of Zaires own security in the face of Soviet threats                            not only to the south in Angola but also on other sidesin Cabinda and                            Congo Brazzaville While the Soviets poured military equipment into                            those areas Zaire remained essentially unprotected: none of the                            countrys vital areasInga Dam the copper belt the capital the                            portshad any protection from military attack Nor did Zaire have any means for making its own                            armaments While the Soviet Union and its friends guaranteed continued                            support until the end to those threatening Zaires security Zaire had                            no such assurances I expressed understanding of Mobutus concerns assured him we                            would continue to do our best to help and discussed in this context our                                FMS and economic assistance                            programs for the coming year5 I then turned to the urgent matter of preventing any additional                            recognitions of the MPLA before the                                OAU summit noting that Zaire was                            in a position to play a key role in this effort and that we for our                            part were ready to lend support in any way possible Mobutu reiterated his belief that no                            more than twenty African states will have recognized the MPLA by the time the OAU convenes leaving a clear majority                            with which to work at the meeting He conceded however that the MPLA and its backers were waging a                            vigorous campaign which had to be watched carefully Mobutu blamed Algeria in particular                            for trying to drum up support for MPLA                            in the name of nonalignment We then reviewed the status of                            individual states: Cameroon was shaky but visits by both Bula and me during the next few days                            should help Chad was also doubtful but Mobutu working through Bongo had assured them of some military assistance as a                            counter to the Soviets help The Nigerians I said were worth                            continued attention since despite their recognition of the MPLA they had told us they still                            supported the idea of a coalition government Mobutu agreed On the other hand                                Mobutu thought Ghana had                            caved because of Nigerian pressure and was not salvageable6 Comment:Mobutu was obviously concerned                            about developments in Washington and their effects on both the Angolan                            effort and our ability to continue contributing to Zaires own security                            However he was not discouraged and seemed readily to accept my                            assurances that we have every intention of staying in the game Somewhat                            to my surprise he did not raise the question of South African forces in                                AngolaSee Document                                    165 as I thought he might with a view to seeking                            our intercession to keep them there While we did not get into the                            substance of Mobutus views on a                            possible OAU settlementand I am not                            sure his thinking has progressed very far along this line or that he                            concerns himself with such detailsit is clear that he views the OAU summit as a major challenge and                            opportunity for movement on the political front He did point out that                            the heavily armed and equipped position of MPLA forces makes ceasefire disadvantageous for the other                            movements and Zaire It is also clear that he shares our concern for                            holding the line on MPLA recognition                            before the summit In this connection Foreign Minister Bula will be sent shortly to Zambia and Uganda as well                            as Cameroon to maintain pressure on this issue7 I am convinced that while we can continue to count on Zaire in the                            military sphere we cannot look to Mobutu to provide the major impetus for effectively                            organizing politicaldiplomatic efforts among friendly African states                            prior to or during the OAU meetingCutler	19751227

sharp shock wave                            through our Embassy and the American community in Greece As of late                            this morning December 24 we still have no hard information as to who                            committed this terrible crime and why2 The Greek Government has been cooperative and vigorous in initiating                            an extensive investigation and is making a major effort to apprehend                            those responsible In addition senior Greek officials have informed me                            that additional security measures have been undertaken for the                            protection of US officials in Greece3 During the night I spoke repeatedly by telephone with Minister of                            Coordination Papaligouras the senior Minister in Athens at the present                            time in view of Caramanlis absence in Corfu Defense Minister                                Averoff and Foreign Minister                                Bitsios Averoff also personally came to the                            Embassy during the night on instructions from the Prime Minister to                            convey officially the regrets of the Greek Government over this tragic                            event and to assure me that the Greek Government was taking all                            appropriate action to get to the bottom of it In addition President                                Tsatsos abruptly terminated an                            official dinner last night and sent his Diplomatic Counselor to see me                            to convey his personal and official regrets Prime Minister Caramanlis                            also personally called me from Corfu early this morning for the same                            purpose4 Despite the shock and sadness we all feel here over Dicks death the                            Embassy is of course open today and functioning as normally as possible                            although I have ordered that certain additional security measures be                            taken We are also flying the flag at half mast for today We have                            received innumerable calls and visits from Greeks and representatives of                            other Governments expressing their sympathy and abhorrence over this                            event5 Although we do not as yet have any firm clues as to who the                            perpetrators of this crime are or why they did it the environment in                            which we operate here certainly has played a part You are undoubtedly                            aware that we continue to be subject to attacks and criticism in the                            pressalthough somewhat more muted nowand there has been a renewed                            upsurge lately of virulent antiCIA                            stories based mostly on news stories filed from Washington This was                            given a special impetus last month when the English language Athens News                            published a list of alleged CIA                            officials in Athens Athens 9252Dated                                November 26 Ibid Dick Welch was named as the CIA Station Chief here in this and other                            stories that followed which also gave his home address Some papers                            also printed pictures of his residence6 In addition to this general atmosphere of animosity toward the CIA there are of course numerous groups                            in Greece including Greek Cypriot students refugees and others who                            have particularly strong feelings about the alleged activities and                            responsibilities of the CIA in                            connection with the junta and the subsequent Cyprus tragedy It is too                            early to say whether the assassins came from these or any other Greek                            Cypriot or Greek group of either extreme Hopefully the investigation                            being conducted by the Greek police authorities will reveal the identity                            of those responsible quickly I intend to see that they

                 had more speculation than facts to report about who was responsible                                for the murder the Athens press has continued to print                            stories on the Welch assassination                            based largely on foreign press reports However the principal story in                            the press on December 30 is the announcement by the Ministry of Public                            Order of monetary rewards for information in connection with the assassination Reports also cover                            the shipment of the remains of the deceased to the US2 The Ministrys announcement states that the Greek Government had                            authorized payment of five million drachmas to anyone providing specific                            information on the identity of the murderers a sum of between one and                            two million drachmas will be given for information which contributes to                            clarification of the affair The announcement asserted that anyone                            providing such information could be assured that his anonymity would be                            protected in every way The Ministry cited as a basis for this the                            justified public interest and the need to accelerate the investigation                            so that an early solution to the crime which is both hideous and                            unprecedented in Greek experience can be found3 Press reports also covered the simple ceremony ref B held on                            December 29 at the Athenai US Air Base when the remains of the                            deceased departed for the United States Several newspapers carried a                            photograph of an honor guard of Marines carrying the coffin onto the                            aircraft4 There have been no leads in the investigation The Greek press had                            reported earlier that two different organizations have claimed credit                            for the Welch murder One called                            itself the Organization of Officers of the National Idea and the other                            the November 17th organization after the date of the 1973 events at                            the

Department USIA and other Washington                            agencies dealing with the media should bear in mind that although a                            virtual blackout exists of local comment on the murder the Greek press                            continues to reproduce foreign press accounts and statements It is in                            fact relying on these to keep the story rolling As usual quotations                            are frequently wrenched out of context and elaborated to suit the                            editorial purposes of individual Greek papers In these circumstances it                            is particularly important for US spokesmen to avoid speculative comment                            of any kind whether for attribution or on

            the International Energy Program We are now in the process of preparing to                        deposit the formal notification of our consent to be bound by the IEPSent on                            January 7 1976 in telegram 4007 to Brussels National Archives                                RG 59 Central Foreign Policy Files                            D7600060262This legislation also contains many of the essential portions of the                        administrations energy programIt establishes a number of important conservation measures which will have                        increasing impact over the next five yearsIt sets average fuel economy standards for automobiles for 1980 and                        1985It extends the authority of the Federal Energy Administration FEA to direct power plants and other major                        fuelburning installations to convert to the use of coalIt requires energy efficiency labeling of major appliances and certain other                        consumer products and sets energy efficiency standards for certain                        categories of appliancesIt requires FEA to set 1980 conservation                        targets for the ten major energy consuming industries thus establishing a                        program to encourage increased efficiency in US industrial energy useIt provides for development and implementation of state energy conservation                        programs with Federal financial and technical assistanceWe estimate that these measures will have a substantial impact on energy                        demand over the next decade and will make a major contribution to the                        ability of the US to meet its goals for                        reduced dependence on imported oil by 1980 and 1985The oil pricing provisions fall short of what we had originally proposed to                        the Congress The Act sets an average price of 766 per barrel for all                        domestically produced oil With the removal of the 2 per barrel import fee                        on December 21 we estimate that prices will decrease about 040 per barrel                        as a result of the rollback The law gives the President authority to adjust                        the composite price upward by as much as ten percent annually with                        Congressional approvalThe Act also contains the following provisions supportive of our joint                        efforts in the IEA:It authorizes prompt initiation of a strategic oil storage program an early                        storage plan to build additional stocks up to 150 million barrels or 25 days                        of imports by 1978 and a longrange reserve of up to one billion barrels                        which will be completed by 1982 This is over and above present stockpiling                        levels of about 100 days under the IEA                        definitionIt requires the President to submit to Congress mandatory conservation plans                        within six months After Congressional approval these plans can be used to                        carry out US obligations to restrain demand                        under the IEPIt authorizes the President to promulgate rules for oil allocation as                        necessary to carry out US obligations under                        the IEP This would not be subject to                        approval by CongressIt establishes a legal basis for US industry                        cooperation with the IEA under a voluntary                        agreementIt provides authority for collection of oil market data and authorizes                        transmittal to the IEA of information                        required under the IEPAlthough it only partly meets our original targets I believe this                        legislation provides a solid foundation for a continuing US effort to                        reduce our dependence on imported oil to an acceptable level Over the next two years we estimate that                            US oil imports will increase marginally                        about 250000 barrels per day because of the effect of this legislation                        After that however the impact of the bill will become much more pronounced                        and our import levels will decline By 1985 US imports are projected at five million barrels per                        daycompared to eight million barrels per day under our prior estimates In                        addition legislation now close to passage by Congress for production and                        exploration of our Naval Petroleum Reserves and other measures proposed by                        the President should reduce US oil imports                        even furtherThis bill reinforces the US commitment to                        joint cooperation in the IEA The Long Term                        Cooperation Program on which we achieved tentative agreement earlier this                        month is essential to ensure that our individual and collective efforts are                        adequate to achieve our energy objectives I look forward to completing this                        agreement at our next meeting With best

negotiations: Summary report for period Dec 1519 19751 Begin summary The final week of the seventh round of the Vienna force reduction negotiations witnessed the formal introduction of the Allied nuclear reduction proposal Option III US rep made the offer in a Dec 16 plenary statementTelegram 623 from the delegation to MBFR December 16 contained the statement Ibid in accordance with NACapproved guidance which NATO Ministers authorized Dec 12Telegram Secto 24038 December 12 reported on the NATO Ministers authorization Ibid D7504320414 for use prior to the winter recess At the Dec 18 plenary meeting Soviet rep Khlestov provided the first official Eastern reaction to the new Western move Khlestov said that the East would study the proposal Soviet rep noted that the West had emphasized the onetime nature of the proposal and that it had been preceded by extensive Western press play involved only US tactical weapons was conditioned on Eastern acceptance of the Western reduction program and would not preclude increases in air forces and nuclear delivery systems by nonUS Western direct participants Eastern comments on the offer to the press and in bilateral exchanges with Western reps generally echoed Khlestovs plenary remarks End summary2 Following months of speculation by Eastern reps here and in the Western press the Allies this week officially added an offer of US nuclear reduction to their negotiating position in the Vienna force reduction talks US rep formally made the offer to the East in a special Dec 16 plenary meeting His presentation followed the NACapproved guidance which NATO Ministers had authorized Dec 12 for use prior to the end of the current round US rep emphasized that the possible withdrawal of 1000 nuclear warheads 54 nuclear capable F4 aircraft and 36 Pershing ballistic missile launchers from the US inventory in the reductions area was a unique offer dependent upon Eastern acceptance of previous Western proposals all of which remained unchanged that it was not a step toward further reductions and that reduction of nonUS Western equipment was not included in it nor would limitations on such equipment be acceptable to the West In connection with this initiative US rep stated that the West now proposed a combined common collective ceiling on ground and air manpower which might be set at approximately 900000 men on each side US rep stressed that West was taking this initiative because of the need for decisive action to break the impasse in the negotiations and move them toward the successful conclusion of a first phase agreement His statement ended with an appeal for a considered and positive Eastern response when the talks resume following the winter recess3 As agreed by the ad hoc group US rep met Dec 15 with Soviet rep Khlestov to brief him on the contents of the Western nuclear initiative While mainatining a noncommittal attitude on the substance of the matter Khlestov was considerably more relaxed than had been the case during a Dec 13 session in which US rep had discussed with him arrangements for the formal introduction of the new Allied proposalNo record of this meeting has been found We would speculate that in the interim Khlestov had received some reassurance that as he had repeatedly warned might be the case Moscow would not instruct him to reject the offer out of hand as a Western propaganda ploy4 Soviet rep Khlestov made the only presentation at the Dec 18 concluding plenary meeting of the seventh round A few paragraphs near the end of his statement provided the first official Eastern reaction to the Allied nuclear initiative He stated that the East as was customary in such cases would examine the contents of the proposal Khlestov observed however that the proposal included only US tactical nuclear weapons and that it was conditioned on acceptance of the Western reduction program to which Eastern objections were well known He noted Western emphasis on the onetime character of the offer and that it would not limit actual increases in air forces and nuclear delivery systems Further Soviet rep wondered what conclusions should be reached from the prolonged detailed and propagandist treatment accorded the move in the Western press given the practice of confidentiality in the negotiations5 The balance of Soviet reps statement contained a measured criticism of the Western position along standard lines and summed up developments during the latest round Under the latter heading Khlestov dwelt on the question of force definitions He termed resolution of this issue essential and faulted the West for continuing to resist agreement to the principle that similar force types should be allocated to the same armed service6 After the Dec 18 plenary the East with Czechoslovak rep Lahoda as spokesman held a press conference His prepared statement consisted mainly of a lowkey synopsis of Khlestovs earlier comments on the Allied nuclear proposal including the fact that it would receive Eastern study The meeting quickly broke up once newsmen discovered that they could not get Czechoslovak rep to expand on the topic7 EastWest bilateral exchanges during the week were similarly guarded Eastern reps generally confined themselves to a ritual expression of disappointment with the contents of the new Western offer particularly its USonly and onetime aspects They also tended to play upon the pressleaksequalspropagandaploy theme By Dec 18 Eastern reps were nevertheless adding that the initiative would receive thorough examination8 The Vienna talks are scheduled to reconvene the week of January 26Resor	19751219

            INTEREST TO US AS PINE GAP WOOMERA AND NORTHWEST CAPE WE BELIEVE THAT                            THE POSITIONS RECOMMENDED IN DEALING WITH THESE SUBJECTS WILL MAKE IT                            LESS LIKELY THAT THE RETENTION OF THE THREE MAJOR FACILITIES HERE WILL                            BECOME A CONTENTIOUS POLITICAL ISSUE IN THE FUTURE WE HAVE IN THE                                FRASER GOVERNMENT A                            CONSERVATIVE GROUP WHICH APPRECIATES THE IMPORTANCE OF AUSTRALIAS                            DEFENSE TIES TO THE UNITED STATES AND WHICH IS PREPARED TO
