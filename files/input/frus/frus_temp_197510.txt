NATO ref bAs reported in telegram 5148 during the September 17 meeting of                                the NAC the Greek representative                                described the background of the Greek decision to change its                                relationship with NATO and his                                countrys sense that it had to look out for itself without the help                                of allies against a menace from within the alliance Looking                            ahead to the process of continuing Greek NATO discussions on this subject ref cAs reported in telegram 5330 Luns met with the Greek                                representative who had stated that Greece would offer proposals in                                October for the evolution of its military relationship with NATO as a basis for                                negotiations following are considerations which are                            presented as a general frame of reference for addressee posts2 We are well aware of the obstacles in the present political                            environment to rapid progress on the GreeceNATO relationship Accordingly we are not optimistic that                            Greece will wish to cooperate in the rapid resolution of outstanding                            issues with NATO and we recognize that                            there are probably limits on how fast US and others can force the pace                            at least in the near future3 At the same time we want to leave no misunderstanding with Greece or                            other allies about our strong view that Greece should resume its full                            responsibilities as a NATO member and                            that productive discussions on this important subject should move                            forward In the US view the quality and integrity of the alliance must                            be preserved on the basis of unqualified participation not on the basis                            of partial membership or special arrangements In the specific case of                            Greece our bilateral defense arrangements less than                                1 line not declassified are intimately linked to the Greek                            role in NATO4 Further we appreciate Turkeys concerns with major questions posed by                            ambiguous Greek role in NATO including                            early warning communications and problems of command and control in                            southeastern Europe These problems would be best worked out in                            cooperation with Greece and through Greeces return to the NATO military structure They are                            however questions that cannot be postponed indefinitely and Greece                            should be kept aware of this fact We are encouraged that Greece in its                            September 17 statement said that practical military arrangements in                            these areas can and will be found5 Against this background we believe the US suggestion ref a that an                            openended ad hoc group under the DPC                            address the Greek NATO relationship is                            a positive one providing a forum which will keep Greece aware of US and                            allied views and permit movement toward resolution of issues while at                            the same time allowing greater flexibility than the more formal DPC framework Similarly we believe the                            suggestion ref a by the chairman of NATOs Military Committee that in parallel with the work of this ad hoc                            group SACEURSHAPE work privately with Greece on                            specific military problems is also positive Conceptually we can                            divide major problems in the GreeceNATO military relationship into two categories One focuses                            on the commitment of Greek forces to NATO The other relates to NATOs requirements for an orderly defense structure in                            southeastern Europe including questions of command and control early                            warning and communications as underscored by Turkey To the extent                            that NATO through SACEUR can develop with Greece a more                            satisfactory pattern of provisional arrangements in both categories                            while at the same time exploring avenues for future progress and                            resolution we believe these problems can be eased for a time The US                            will of course wish to be kept well informed of the status of the                                GreeceSACEUR discussions6 Mission may draw on paras 35 as appropriate with Luns Greek Delegation and other                            allies Mission may also point out that Greece some time ago presented a                            paper on its future NATO relationship                            which was informally discussed with a small group of allies refs c and                            d We are disappointed that results of these discussions were not                            reflected in the Greek presentation September 17 Athens should also                            find occasion to outline these views to GOG including especially that portion of para 3

Ambassador                            Subject: Yeos Report on His Talks                            with French1 Our meetings with de Larosiere                            two hours in the am and ClappierBernard                                Clappier was the Governor of the Bank of France 2 hours in                            the pm were very cordial In general we made the following points:                            exchange rate instability had been somewhat exaggerated in the sense                            that cases of extreme instability were confined to the US dollar and                            several of the key snake countries plus the Swiss franc2 The basic impetus for instability came from the inflationary                            environment We described the impact on real economies eg a boom                            characterized by speculation in commodities inventories and real                            estate and then subsequent recession and not surprisingly the sharpest                            in post World War II history Not only were these real factors working                            to produce rate instability but as inflation and recession affected                            different countries with various degrees of intensity and timing the                            variability of rates was increased3 In our explanation of the sources of exchange rate instability we                            cited a second major factor capital flows We explained that one legacy                            of ten years of inflation was buildup in short term assets This                            resulted from the necessity to finance inflation expansion with short                            term financing the longer term markets being quite limited This                            tendency has been reinforced by the process of financing oil deficits                            The resultant enormous buildup in short term assets has produced the                            raw materials for large and swift capital flows4 During the last six years the balance of power has shifted against                            officials The buildup in the volume of funds handled in the private                            market the incredibly large amounts that private sources can muster in                            moving from one currency to another mean that officials ability to                            influence rates is extremely limited5 In our view this will only change when expectations of price stability                            have revived sufficiently to permit the funding out of the short term                            finance associated with the last ten years In effect one prerequisite                            to exchange rate stability will have to be a refunding of the financing                            of the late 60s and the 70s to date6 I explained that we were very interested in increased stability in                            exchange rates and financial markets in general Our analysis of the sources of instability leads                            us to conclude that the key to reduced variability is effective                            countrybycountry stabilization policies and that we felt that there                            could be more effective consultations in this area7 De Larosiere seemed somewhat                            surprised and quite interested in our opening statement He agreed with                            the analysis and described their own views as to the effects of rate                            variability on the allocation of resources in the French economy and the                            cost of hedging and thus the flow of trade8 He went on to say that they felt something should be done about the                            extreme rate fluctuations After some probing extreme rate                            fluctuations appeared to be viewed as the last excesses of a trend                            end We agreed that because of the change in balance of power nothing                            could or should be done in terms of effecting changes in basic market                            moves or trends Nor should anything be done in resetting rate                            relationships eg the lowering of the snake relative to the                            dollar9 From what was actually said the French view of intervention for                            stabilization would be only two to three shades different from our own                            criteria of intervention for the purpose of assuring the orderly                            functioning of markets We sense that there could be a difference                            between what is said and what is meant The market has administered a                            lesson in foreign exchange to the French During most of August and well                            into September the dollars firming was facilitated and added to by                            large French operations in which dollars were purchased This aggressive                            intervention added to the euphoria that enveloped traders and the dollar                            and helped set the stage for the very sharp downward adjustment that has                            characterized the last two weeks as the bear trap closed aided by a                            slight relaxation in US monetary policy10 We believe that they feel that efforts to intervene would be more                            successful and by a material margin if we were intervening on a                            cooperative basis11 That is what they want a willingness on our part to coordinate and                            cooperate on intervention policy and moves They either feel that this                            will be successful or that its failure will set the stage for enlarged                            intervention efforts In addition they want a general commitment that                            the direction of our efforts ought to lead toward stability that one of                            our principal objectives ought to be stability Their third objective                            seems to be to implant within the IMF a                            mechanism for monitoring or IMF                            surveillance over the efforts of countries to move in the direction of                            stability in rates12 In return we sense that we can obtain a rather narrow description of                            the circumstances and objectives of intervention much narrower than                            their own objectives In addition we ought to be able to settle the                            theology of the exchange rate question in a manner acceptable to us We                            ought to be able to attach to any statement regarding financial stability language reflecting                            our own interpretation of the sources of instability Finally it is                            possible though we have not had a thorough exploration of the subject                            that we can avoid a narrow monitoring of intervention practices by the                                IMF and instead broaden the                            monitoring to include moves taken to deal with underlying causes of                            instability and place this within the context of the Interim                            Committee13 Our sense is that they would very much like to move toward agreement                            before the summit At the end of our conversation de Larosiere asked if we could return                            for a second visit within the context of the current trip Without                            reshuffling scheduled visits our trip could be extended by one day                                FridayOctober 7 which time                            could be spent with de Larosiere14 Other matters mentioned to the French: 1 we planned to make no                            mention of any progress made in our discussions to other interested                            parties 2 We intended to continue our direct approach dealing                            directly with the French and not using third parties eg the                            Germans15 We recommend that we extend for one day The risk is that the general                            good feeling could be disrupted by attempts to move in the direction of                            concrete agreement The advantage is that the desire to avoid the risk                            will facilitate substantive progress in the direction of agreement16 If we extend for one day we would try to achieve something tangible                            in the following areas: 1 Statement of objectives of intervention and                            conditions under which cooperative efforts might occur Our view is that                            anything other than very moderate efforts to facilitate the orderly                            functioning of markets is futile The French say that they agree 2                            Outline of language that would settle the exchange rate question in                            terms of IMF Articles 3 Agreement on                            linking present rate variability with underlying factors and describing                            the objective as not limited to the achievement of stability per se but                            also including a system in which the exchange of goods and service and                            the flow of capital are facilitated 4 Discussions on some improvement                            in the existing mechanisms for dealing with the underlying causes of                            instability 5 Related to point 4 a coupling of the broader causes of                            instability with the narrower specific efforts to deal with it

Treasury Secretary Simon                            Subject: Under Secretary Yeos                            Report on Conversations with GermansOur discussions with Poehl were quite pleasant and frank They centered                            on the following points:1 Poehl indicated that he expected Giscard to make a presentation on exchange rates They                            anticipate that it will cover familiar territory describing recent                            exchange rate fluctuations attributing the current economic stagnation                            to exchange rate variability and calling for establishment of bands or                            zones within which rates should be kept2 This view of the French position as insisting on zones was in no way                            congruent with the tone or specifics of our conversations in Paris with                                de Larosiere or ClappierSee Document                                1073 Interestingly Poehl indicated that they thought an appropriate zone                            with the DM would be 250 to 270 This                            compares with the figures of 240 to 260 mentioned by Emminger in a speech several weeks                                agoOn September 15 the Embassy in                                Bonn reported on an August 26 article written by Bundesbank Vice                                President Otmar Emminger in                                which he discussed the dollars strength visvis the mark and the                                implications of an exchange rate that hovered between DM 240 and DM 260 per dollar a rate below DM 240 would mean trouble for West German exporters                                while a rate above DM 260 would                                raise import prices and exacerbate inflation Telegram 15123 from                                Bonn September 15 National Archives RG 59 Central Foreign Policy                                Files4 Either the Germans are not aware of the current French position as                            described by de Larosiere or they                            themselves are pushing for zones by using the French5 Poehl apologized for their performance in re the SDRaid link at the UN He explained that                            the Chancellor confronted late at night by the urgings of Genscher and Bahr had made the decision to withdraw their                            reservation on the link Following the UN affair the Chancellor had                            been criticized in the press for acquiescing to the link As a result he                            issued an interpretation of their position which in substance stated                            that they are still opposed to the link6 We agreed that the link would destroy the SDR as originally conceived Furthermore the link lacked                            any semblance of conditionality any consultation with a view to                            improving individual countries economic performance and any political                            quid pro quo We suggested that the private banking systems ability to                            continue to finance that part of the LDCs deficits which could be described as structural is                            limited The heavy debt burdens of many LDCs plus the banking systems own limitations suggest that                            the flow of private credit might stagnate or decline somewhat Improved                            world economic conditions might mitigate the LDCs earning problems but to the degree individual LDCs have structural concerns the positive                            effect would be only partial7 It is clear that Poehl and perhaps others in the German Government are                            concerned about the liquidity issue We indicated that the very sizeable amount of                            shortterm economic expansion in recent years should not be confused                            with international liquidity Existence of huge capital flows is not a                            symptom of too much liquidity or too little We indicated that our own                            concern centered on the distribution of official liquidity and the                            related fundamental issue of individual countries comparative earning                            power8 Poehl indicated he personally feared an attempt by the British and                            Italians in conjunction with the LDCs to                            try for a new issue of SDRs9 We agreed this would be undesirable in the sense that it would                            represent an attempt to float everyone off the rocks without addressing                            underlying problems We indicated at some point individual countries                            standards of living must be related to their earning capacities                            Expansion of SDRs would in effect                            transfer income from healthy developed countries to others The                            mechanism would be through the process of inflation engendered by the                            broad issuance of SDRs and this in turn                            would cripple our individual efforts to bring about price stability10 We indicated that Germanys ability to operate as an island of price                            stability in the future would be limited by other countries adoption of                            individual price stabilization programs and in any case meant that                            Germany would have to accept such low real rates of growth that they                            would have in effect embraced a policy of engineered stagnation11 We discussed the New York City problem and gave them a full review of                            the situationThe finances of New York City                                were in such disarray that the city was in danger of defaulting on                                its loans On October 3 Chancellor Schmidt told President Ford: I am also worried about Simons attitude toward New York                                If New York shouldnt pay on the bonds it could be looked on                                outside the United States as kind of a Black Friday There are other                                cities not like New York but that are under some suspicion and if                                New York collapsed they perhaps couldnt sell bonds I am                                sympathetic to the problem of New Yorks mismanagement but there is                                a psychological problem involved Memorandum of conversation                                October 3 Ford Library                                National Security Adviser Memoranda of Conversation Box 15                            It was apparent that they were not familiar with many of the pivotal                            factors in re the overall issue12 We discussed the chairmanship of the Interim Committee Poehl said he                            favored Duisenberg Impartiality                            and a steady and even hand were the most important criteria to us and we                            indicated some reservations re                                Duisenberg Poehl then mentioned Healey and Declerq                            and we indicated both were on our list but we were not prepared as of                            that moment to put forward a nameRichardson	19751014

was held                        in Paris from 7 to 15 April 1975 met again at the International Conference                        Centre from 13 to 16 October 1975 under the technical chairmanship of Mr de Guiringaud Ambassador of France with a                        view to pursuing preparation for the dialogue on energy raw materials                        problems of development including all related financial questions2 The ten delegations confirmed the agreement of their authorities on the                        convening of an international conference on these questions They decided                        that the conference will be called the Conference on International Economic                        Cooperation that it will be held in Paris that it will be composed of 27                        members designated as indicated below and that it will be convened at                        Ministerial level on 16 December 1975 for a session of two or possibly three                        days The SecretaryGeneral of the United Nations will be invited to the                        Ministerial conference3 The European Economic Community the United States and Japan on the one

the other hand will assume responsibility for the designation from among                        their respective groups and according to the procedures which the                        industrialized countries and the developing countries respectively deem                        appropriate of five industrialized countries and twelve developing                        countries to be added to the present participants so as to bring to                        twentyseven the number of participants in the conference The French                        Government will be notified within a period which should not exceed one                        month of the list thus established of the delegations to be invited to the                        Ministerial conference4 The ten delegations also decided that the conference should have two                        cochairmen chosen respectively by each of the two participating groups from                        among its members and that they should preside alternately over the                        meetings in a manner to be agreed between them The participants in the                        preparatory meeting recommend that the two cochairmen should be designated                        as soon as possible after the lists of participants in the conference have                        been completed and they suggest that the two cochairmen should begin                        immediately after being designated to take together all necessary steps in                        liaison with the host country to ensure that the Ministerial conference                        proceeds satisfactorily5 The preparatory meeting proposes to the Ministerial conference that it set                        up a commission for energy a commission for raw materials a commission for                        development and a commission for financial affairs Each of these                        commissions should consist of fifteen members ten of them representing                        developing participants in the conference from among its members6 In determining the composition of its representation in each commission                        each of the two groups at the conference should choose from among its                        members those who because of their special interest and the overall significance of their participation                        seem best suited to take part in order that the work may be carried out in                        an effective and responsible manner7 The chairmanship of each of the commissions should be assumed by two                        cochairmen designated by each of the two groups respectively Joint                        meetings of the cochairmen of the commissions may be planned if the need                        arises8 The preparatory meeting recommends that the intergovernmental functional                        organizations which are directly concerned with the problems considered and                        which the Ministerial conference deems to be able to make a useful                        contribution to their discussion be represented on a permanent basis in the                        corresponding commissions by observers with the right to speak but without                        the right to vote and hence not participating in the formation of a                        consensus In addition to the United Nations Secretariat the list of these                        organizations should include in particular OPEC IEA UNCTAD OECD FAO GATT UNIDO UNDP IMF and IBRD Furthermore each commission may invite appropriate                        intergovernmental functional organizations to participate as observers ad                        hoc in the examination of specific questions9 Members of the conference wishing to follow the work of a commission to                        which they do not belong should be entitled to appoint a representative in                        the capacity of auditor without the right to speak10 The activities of the four commissions whose establishment is recommended                        by the preparatory meeting will proceed on the basis of the relevant                        paragraphs of the aidemmoire annexed to the French invitation:See footnote 4 Document

and the results achieved                        and will be entrusted with facilitating the establishment or reinforcement                        as the case may be of arrangements for accelerating

is understood that the four commissions should function in parallel                        and that the results of their work are linked and should be submitted to the                        Ministerial conference11 It is agreed that any delegation may raise any subject relevant to the                        themes of the dialogue for discussion in the commissions12 It has been agreed in accordance with the relevant paragraphs of the                        abovementioned aidemmoire that the Ministerial conference will be called                        upon to set the general guidelines for the work of the commissions13 The preparatory meeting recommends to the Ministerial conference that the                        relevant paragraphs of the abovementioned aidemmoire as interpreted and                        clarified above as well as the abovementioned guidelines for the                        commissions sic14 Some delegations have already tabled with this preparatory meeting                        documents proposing subjects to be discussed in the commissions The                        preparatory meeting recommends that the Ministerial conference agree that                        these and any other proposals which may be tabled subsequently in accordance                        with the general guidelines be discussed in the commissions15 As regards the practical measures the preparatory meeting recommends                        that the conference adopt English Arabic Spanish and French as official                        languages and working languages16 The preparatory meeting recommends that the conference adopt the rules of                        procedure which it itself had adopted and which are based in particular                        on the principle of consensus according to which decisions and                        recommendations are adopted when the chair has established that no member                        delegation has made any objection17 The preparatory meeting considers that the conference should have an                        international secretariat with an exclusively administrative and technical                        function the Ministerial meeting being responsible on the basis of                        proposals by the two cochairmen for determining its organization                        establishing its operational procedure and allocating the financial costs in                        respect of it It is understood however that pending a decision on the                        provisions to be adopted for the continuation of the work the French                        Government will assume responsibility and provide the secretariat for the                        Ministerial meeting scheduled for December 1975 under the conditions in                        which these services were provided for the preparatory meeting18 The preparatory meeting finally recommends that the Ministerial                        conference decide to meet again at Ministerial level in about twelve months time One or several                        meetings of the conference at the level of government officials could                        possibly be held at least six months after the first meeting of the                        conference19 In conclusion the participants paid tribute to President Giscard dEstaing for the initiative taken                        by him thanks to which a dialogue was successfully initiated and to the                        French Government for all the efforts it has made towards that end End text3 Conference concluded with constructive and conciliatory atmosphere similar                        to that existing at start of meeting General sentiment was that despite

were unsuccessful in this effortThe US negotiators in Moscow led by Under                            Secretary Robinson hoped to                            extract from the Soviets a major oil price discount which would be                            of use publicly in the US as a demonstration of the concessions                            obtained through the use of agropower Rush reported that Robinson told him: The Soviets are not anxious to sell                            us oil in the first place since they already have export commitments                            They are even less anxious to sell oil at a highly concessional price                            because they can readily obtain world market prices from other                            countries Telegram 26519 from

earlier approach using a different and less open price discount                            which had previously produced tentative acceptance from the Soviet side                            Telegram 26555 from Paris October 14 ibid However I believe                        that as result of your initiative commencing in July we have achieved in                        agreements signed today important benefits for the American public farmers and maritime interestsThe letter of intent provided that: 1 the Soviet Union                            would offer to sell 10 million metric tons of crude oil and petroleum                            products annually to the United States 2 the US Government could                            purchase the oil for its own use or US firms could purchase it 3 70                            percent of what the Soviet Union sold would be crude and the rest would                            be products 4 some portion of the crude or products would be shipped                            to the United States partly in tankers used to transport grain from                            the United States to the Soviet Union 5 some portion of the crude

                      level which will assure the interests of both the Government of the                            United States and the Government of the Union of Soviet Socialist

efforts to achieve Soviet acknowledgment of                        oil price discount we can recover from this Further negotiations leading                        to a secondstage oil agreement calling for transfer of advanced US                        technology and equipment to expand oil production from existing Soviet                        facilities could prove beneficial to both sides in this effort Our                        challenge will be to continue to signal US agripower and at same time                        develop new economic dimensions with the Soviets thus further

Paris who may comment directly Hormats is working on a scenario paper and                        draft communiqu for your returnOmitted here are paragraphs unrelated to energyVI Energy105 Our underlying objectives are A to reduce the OPEC manipulation of price and supply and                        thus B to restore the independence of action of industrial countries under                            US leadershipState of Play:106 Deadlock with the Congress has undercut our leadership on most energy                        issues107 In the absence of an effective US lead few countries have taken more                        than perfunctory action on conservation Britain Germany and France have the best program or on                        alternative supplies nuclear is lagging in all countries and government                        policies on petroleum and gas pricing and taxes inhibit development in                        Canada and Britain as well as the US108 Despite this weakness fewer industrial countries now think that the                        solution can be found in negotiations with the producers than did six months                        ago This is because of repeated evidence at Prepcons I and II of producer                        reluctance to negotiate on oil prices combined with repeated failure in                            IEA exercises to identify multilateral                        oil deals that would be both in our interest and negotiable The best we                        could get most people reason is the current price indexed That would                        provide protection against an eventual increase in the real price but the                        future is so uncertain that most countries are not interested in committing                        themselves Only France seems at this moment to retain interest in an oil                        commodity agreement109 The latest OPEC price increaseSee footnote 4 Document                                82 was taken lying down by the Europeans but it has                        stiffened the Japanese who now talk of taking a firmer line with the                        producers110 With this conjuncture chances now are fair that the IEA will adopt its Long Term Program on                        December 1 with a minimum safeguard price at about 7 a barrelSee Document 90 Canada                        worried about having to soften its nationalistic stand on foreign access to                        Canadian energy Japan worried about Diet reaction to MSP and France which sympathizes with the                            MSP concept but wants to preempt any                            IEA action and is trying to get the                            EC to block action each presents a                        problem But all of these resistances seem to be reducible as of this point                        October 22111 The United States also has a major possible action

The emerging bill will have most of the provisions we want except                        oil decontrol By law oil price controls come off November 15 Congress is                        pledged to complete action beforehand The President can thus go to the                        Summit with an agreed bill the best he can get but with a low conservation                        content Or he can veto or plan to veto the HouseSenate bill The                        Presidents willingness to face the unpopularity of a veto on oil price                        decontrols is his most important energy card visvis the Europeans and                        Japanese112 In their new tough mood the Japanese are talking about using the Summit                        to complete consumer solidarity ie bring the French into IEA We have however no indication from                        Paris that this would be feasible                        if anything the Gaullists are even more opposed to membership now than last                        year when they won a Cabinet debate on the questionConclusion:113 The most important thing is that the President will have made up his                        mind on oil decontrol by the time he leaves for the Summit Further                        uncertainty on this issuethe key to the administrations energy                        policywould be destructive This is particularly true since the President                        is scheduled to lead off on energy The Europeans and Japanese will be                        nervous about an energy policy by veto But even with decontrol by veto the                            US would recover some of its lost                        prestige in energy The President has enough strength to sustain a veto                        provided he gives some or all of the 2 import fee114 With such a base the Summit can give a sense of direction on two                        issues: Negotiations with the producers and reduced dependence On the first                        it would be worthwhile talking through the issue: The damaging economic and                        political effects of high oil prices the relative unattractiveness of                        indexation it gives you protection against real price increases but                        ratifies cartel gains and exposes political leaders to charges they are                        conspiring with producers to put prices up and makes cartel management                        easier the unlikelihood of obtaining a cut in prices and therefore the                        difficulty of attempting to negotiate prices with the producers On that                        basis we are forced back on what we can do within our own borders The                        Summit should recommit IEA members and                        France to lessened dependency115 There is likely to be little advantage and much potential mischief in                        following the Japanese idea of trying to get France in the IEA Giscard has no internal political base                        for such a move even if he wanted to make it Attempts to negotiate with                        France now would only delay the Long Term Program and demoralize the                        agency The Japanese should be turned off in

frus1969-76ve06d287	287 Memorandum From the Director of the Bureau of Intelligence and Research Hyland to Secretary of State Kissinger Washington October 15 1975 Hyland responded to the analysis presented in Zaire telegram 9078 Document 286 finding that it contained some valid observations but that its recommendations were ultimately naive and almost guaranteed to produce the results it warned against	None	1975-10-15 00:00:00	Hyland	Kissinger	DEPARTMENT OF STATEOctober 15 1975To:The SecretaryFrom:William G HylandComments on Embassy Kinshasa Cable on AngolaThe basic thrust of this critique and recommendations Tab A is that we                            should limit our commitment in Angola because the risk of becoming more                            deeply involved outweighs any objectives that are within our grasp The                            Embassy officers  who not having been briefed are only deducing the                            nature and extent of our Angolan operations  estimate that the present                            policy has only the slimmest chance of success they fear that unless we                            limit our commitment to Mobutu                            he will overreach himself and the net result will be that either he will                            opt out after achieving his own immediate aims or that he will go so                            far that his position in Zaire will be endangered1 ObjectivesThe Embassy officers start with a statement of our maximum objectives: to                            block a communist or communistdominated government in Angola and to                            remain ostensibly neutral in doing so This ignores some other aspects: to demonstrate to Mobutu and Kaunda and other Africans that we are                            not paralyzed that as a great power we will stand against the intrusion                            of Soviet power This is especially important if Zaire is in a shaky position                            certainly Mobutu is more                            likely to turn against the US if he thought we were passive observers                            and had no concern at all about his problems than if we make some effort                            to help him2 RisksThe risks described by the Embassy are selfevident ones: 1 Mobutu may opt for a narrow solution                            preserving his own aims 2                            Zaire could overcommit itself and destroy Mobutus own regime 3 a Zairian grab for Cabinda                            would compromise his image and jeopardize his American and European                            financial assistance 4 we could lose Congressional support                            especially for an extended or escalating commitment and this is                            precisely the required kind of commitment to win if the Soviets have                            the determination to outlast us 5 we lose credibility if having                            supported friendly forces in Angola we are forced to climb down 6                            too close an involvement with Mobutu in an unpopular involvement in Angola will                            jeopardize our relations with a successorThe risks of the present course would have to be weighed against the                            risks of any alternative: for example it is likely that Zaire will opt                            for its own solution in any case that Cabinda is clearly up for grabs                            that we lose credibility if we take no action just as much as if we                            make some effort Congressional support cannot be an overriding                            criterion since it can oscillate on any given issue and would probably                            not be opposed to successThe only serious analytical point is the danger of Mobutus going too far because he                            will assume that we have given him a blank check This is a valid                            appreciation of the risks and certainly one that has to be faced as the                            present commitment is exhausted3 RecommendationsThe Embassy recommendation seems naive or if not naive almost                            guaranteed to produce the results they warn against Their                            recommendations are: 1 fix a sustainable level of involvement with                            failsafe check points such as no shipment of USsupplied weapons no                            advisors 2 inform Mobutu                                Savimbi and Roberto that our support is not                            unlimited 3 make clear to Mobutu that too open and deep involvement in Angola                            could jeopardize US and other bilateral financial assistance 4 spell                            out the following objectives to Mobutu: a settle for less than optimum ie a                            coalition government b the US advocates free elections in Angola and                            Cabinda c US does not encourage Mobutu to take action in Cabinda 5 continue to                            challenge the communist initiative  but make an international demand                            for a ceasefire and negotiations under US auspices 6 lobby for free                            electionsIf we were to adopt this course then all the major participants would                            have to conclude that we were close to opting out altogether: explaining                            the limit of our commitment at this time can only be read in this way                            calling for free elections and hinting we can accept a coalition at                            this critical juncture can only guarantee that each of our participants                            will conclude we are looking for a way out and suggesting they do the                            same In this case the Embassys prediction of failure almost certainly                            would then prove correct Overall this seems a typical dissent: a                            fairly well reasoned critique but limp and with almost meaningless                            alternative policy suggestionsThe Present ProspectsLeaving aside this message however the outlook is not promising: It is highly unlikely that either the FNLA or UNITA will gain                            any significant ground between now and the Portuguese withdrawal MPLA will have a strong territorial                            and military position and will gain the recognition of a large number                            of African and Soviet bloc countries FNLA and Mobutu will riot acquiesce in MPLA domination some level of fighting will continueSavimbi will be more of a                            question mark but will probably continue in opposition to the A lastminute facade of coalition might be arranged by the OAU but it will not lastThus the Embassy is correct in a sense in raising the question of the                            limits of our commitment in the political circumstances that are likely                            to prevail inThe outlook is for a continuing civil war and a temporary partition of                            Angola Over time the MPLA assuming                            strong Soviet support will gain control over most of the country                            forcing Savimbi to come to terms especially if Kaunda believes he must                            deal with the MPLA for access to the                            sea in this case Mobutu will                            probably also look to a settlement and probably seize Cabinda  or have                            it occupied by FLEC elements he                            controls  in the processThe main point for the US is that the African participants should not be                            led to this conclusion because they find us a weak reed if they choose                            to live with the MPLA in Angola it                            must be their decision and not ours	19751015

IN WHICH THE WORLD                            ORGANIZATION WOULD PUT ITSELF ON THE POINT OF OFFICIALLY ENDORSING                            ANTISEMITISM WHO SAID THE UNITED NATIONS IS DESTROYING ITSELF THIS                            NIGHT IN THIS ROOM3 AND YET STRONG THINGS SHOWED THROUGH ALSO THE MOST STRIKING WAS THAT                            THE BLACK AFRICANS BROKE WITH THE ARABS WHO PROPOSED TO USE THEM IN THE                            MOST CYNICAL AND SELF SERVING WAY NOT ONE MIGHT ADD FOR THE FIRST                            TIME RECORDED IN HISTORY IN THIS REGARD THE UNITED

BY ABORTING                            THE PROPOSED DECADE TO COMBAT RACISM AND RACIAL DISCRIMINATION AN                            EFFORT WHICH THE AFRICANS HAS PROPOSED AND FOR WHICH IN THE ABSENCE

AGAINST THE RESOLUTION EQUATING ZIONISM WITH RACISM                            WITH PRIOR UNDERSTANDING THAT IF THE LATTER RESOLUTION PASSED WE WOULD                            THEREFORE VOTE AGAINST ALL THREE RESOLUTIONS WHEN THEY CAME TO THE                            GENERAL ASSEMBLY THE AFRICAN STATES WHICH ARE PERFECTLY CAPABLE OF                            SEEING THEIR TRUE INTERESTS IN SUCH MATTERS SAW THAT THE ARABS WERE                            TAKING SOMETHING OF VALUE FROM THEM AND GIVING NOTHING IN RETURN IN THE                            KEY VOTE ON A RESOLUTION OF SIERRA LEONE SECONDED BY ZAMBIA TO PUT OFF                            CONSIDERATION OF THE ANTISEMITIC RESOLUTION UNTIL 1976 ONLY 42 PERCENT                            OF THE BLACK AFRICAN STATES VOTED WITH THE

MORNING A YEAR                            AGO THE ARABS HAD AN AUTOMATIC MAJORITY OF COMMUNIST AFRICAN AND                            ASIAN NATIONS AND THE NERVOUS ABSTENTIONS OF MOST WEST EUROPEANS WELL                            THIS TIME THE WEST EUROPEANS GOT HOLD OF THEIR NERVE AND AS THE POST                            REPORT CONTINUES THE AFRICANS REBELLED4 APART FROM THIS THE MOST STRIKING SHOWING THROUGH WAS THAT OF LATIN                            AMERICA WHICH OVERWHELMINGLY SIDED WITH THE COMMUNIST AND ANTISEMITE                            SIDE ONLY THE TINY STATES OF COSTA

OF THE EVENING WAS THE VOTE BY CHILE IN FAVOR                            OF THE COMMUNISTS AND THE ARABS WE HAVE NO RELIABLE INFORMATION AS TO                            WHY THEY DID THIS OPINION IN THE US MISSION IS ABOUT EQUALLY DIVIDED                            ONE GROUP HOLDS THAT FASCISTS ARE NATURALLY ANTISEMITIC AND THAT THE                            GENERALS WERE ONLY DOING WHAT CAME NATURALLY ANOTHER LESS HISTORICAL                            MORE CYNICAL GROUP HOLDS THAT OPINION IN THE UN CORRIDORS IS CORRECT NAMELY THAT THE CHILEANS SOLD                            THEIR VOTE TO THE ARABS IN RETURN FOR AGREEMENT NOT TO PRESS THE REPORT                            OF THE WORKING GROUP OF THE HUMAN RIGHTS COMMISSION PUBLISHED THIS                            WEEK THAT THE CHILEAN

NOT NOTED FOR ACCURACY BUT                            NONETHELESS DIFFICULT TO DISMISS CLAIMS THAT THROUGH A COMPLEX CIPHER                            IT CAN BE SHOWN THAT PINOCHET IS ACTUALLY ALLENDE IN DISGUISE AND THERE                            HAS BEEN NO CHANGE6 LASTLY THERE SHOULD BE NOTED THAT WHILE ONLY TWENTY NINE NATIONS VOTED                            AGAINST THE ANTISEMITIC RESOLUTION THE UNITED STATES CAN BE PROUD OF                            THE COMPANY IT WAS IN AN ISSUE OF HONOR OF MORALITY WAS PUT BEFORE US                            AND NOT ALL OF US RAN
