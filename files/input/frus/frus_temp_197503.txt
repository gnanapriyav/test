062480Telegram 62480 to Saigon March 20 instructed                                    Lehmann: You should see                                    Thieu as soon as possible                                to obtain from him his rationale for the withdrawal of his forces                                from Kontum and Pleiku and the drawdown of his forces in MRI You should tell him that we need a                                clear picture from him as to his intentions and strategy to deal                                with what is now clearly a general North Vietnamese offensive                                Ibid State Department Telegrams From SECSTATE Nodis 11 I had initiated request to see Thieu shortly before reftel was received Latter therefore provided welcome                            and timely guidance2 I saw the President late this afternoon and told him that I personally                            thought I understood what he was doing and why but that if President Ford the Secretary of State                            the Secretary of Defense and other senior advisers were to be fully                            effective in their continuing strong efforts to provide not only the                            300 million supplemental but further military assistance funds they                            needed to know not my assessment but President Thieus own description of his strategy and                            intentions3 President Thieu said Vietnam                            now found itself faced with a stronger enemy force than at any time                            certainly since 1972 That force is being constantly reinforced with                            units or personnel garblefrom North Vietnams strategic reserve                            divisions Thus the enemy is able to concentrate strong superior forces                            in local areas of his choosing leaving his own forces at a distinct                            disadvantage At the same time South Vietnam is not getting the one for                            one replacement of military items provided for in the Paris                            Agreement4 In light of this situation the President said he could no longer                            fight what from a military standpoint had for the last two years been a                            stupid way to fight a war He had to give up territory or face the                            prospect of having his own forces destroyed piece by piece eventually                            producing a situation where because of effort to defend every part of                            the country he could no longer defend any of it5 In the Highlands he might have kept Pleiku and perhaps Kontum                            However with the roads from the coast blocked by the enemy this could                            have been done only at great cost and even then the strong local                            superiority of the enemy would eventually have made a defense of Pleiku                            a suicide mission He had therefore decided to pull out what forces he could Because of the                            close proximity of strong enemy forces he had considered speed and                            surprise to be essential It had been a trade off between losing some                            equipment and aircraft and perhaps at the expense of a carefully                            organized and very orderly withdrawal or losing all of his forces                            because of inability to disengage themselves from an imminent enemy                            attack6 The loss of Ban Me Thuot the President said had definitely been a                            blow It had happened because the North Vietnamese had been able to                            concentrate a force equivalent to two divisions plus supporting units                            If the government had been able to hold Ban Me Thuot he might have used                            it as a base for the eventual recapture of Pleiku Because of the heavy                            investment of resources which an effort to recapture Ban Me Thuot would                            take and then with an uncertain outcome he had decided to forego the                            attempt7 Turning to the rest of the country especially the northern portion                            and to the future the President said there is a soldiers way and there                            is a politicians way of looking at things From the standpoint of the                            soldier what makes sense in the current situation is an effort to                            maintain the integrity of the country from Binh Dinh Province south                            less the Highland provinces which had been given up8 But as a politician he said he had to think of matters differently                            He said in his speech earlier that day that he would not abandon Thua                            Thien ie Hue and that he was determined to defend our                                territoryThe text of President Thieus speech was                                transmitted in telegram 3187 from Saigon March 20 National                                Archives RG 59 Central Foreign                                Policy Files On the other hand he has had to take away from                            General Truong the airborne division without adequate replacement This                            made the present force ratio in MR1 even                            less favorable to the government than it had been previously Guang Tin                            and most of Quang Ngai Provinces are under present circumstances really                            not defensible General Truong has been instructed to do his best with                            the forces he has at hand Hue would not be abandoned but would be                            fought for The President made it clear however that he did not think                            General Truong would be able to hold anything north of the Hai Van Pass                            The President also made it clear that the defense of Danang had priority                            and that an enclave might emerge there It would have to be decided                            later whether to try to hold that enclave If it were to be useful as a                            beachhead for the future recapture of other territory that was one thing                            but if were to be held simply as a suicide mission that would be                            another9 At the end of our discussion the President returned to the theme that                            until now the RVN had fought a war based                            on the premises of the Paris Agreement This premise had made for a                            stupid war militarily with                            scattered units on the governments side trying to defend every piece of                            territory The current North Vietnamese offensive has now ended any hope                            of continuing to fight on the premises of the Paris Agreement                            Therefore consideration of what is militarily most effective in                            defending as much as the population as possible and maintaining the                            integrity of the armed forces would henceforth be the most important                            consideration10 On US assistance the President said                            that he appreciates and is grateful for President Fords determination to seek 300 million                            supplemental this year He pointed out however that the 300 million                            would not provide for replacement of any capital items lost in combat                                Thieu said he would like for                            example for form strike units to take the offensive to the enemy at                            places of his and not the enemys choosing but without replacement of                            major items he would not be able to do so11 In summary Thieu had made a                            basic decision to trade major parts of territory probably including all                            of MR1 and large portions of MR2 in order to provide for an effective                            defense of the remainder with the resources available It is in my                            view a courageous decisionLehmann	19750320

for Period Ending Noon March 271 GeneralThe situation in and around Danang has deteriorated considerably in the                            past 24 hours NVA attacks began the                            morning of March 27 on GVN defensive                            positions south of the city and one RVNAF unit has already been forced from its position                            Within Danang public order is deteriorating rapidly and roads to the                            airport and Marble Mountain Pier are jammed with people In MR 2 the 41st and 42d Regts along with 420                            of the defenders of An Tuc district have broken through NVA forces which had them cut off and are                            presumably making their way to Qui Nhon About 1200 of the Rangers in                            the PleikuKontum convoy have arrived in Nha Trang but the fate of                            those covering the rear of the column is not clear and it is feared they                            may have been destroyed by the NVA In                                MR 3 Tay Ninh is quiet following the                            heavy NVA shelling in that province

launched an attack on                            elements of the 3rd Division in Trang Binh district Quang Tin and Que Son district                            Quang Nam both of which are part of the

doubt they can hold their position2500 members of the 146th Marine Brigade have been successfully                            evacuated by sea to Danang and are presently being deployed to defend

contributing to paralysis in the city                            There is no traffic control and roads to the airport and the Marble                            Mountain Pier are jammed Gunshots are common in the city and were                            fired during a confrontation around the World Airways 727 evacuating                            refugees from the airport Subsequently discipline

3rd Division the only                            viable ARVN Division in Quang Nam and                            critical to the defense of Danang are in Danang making arrangements for

                     Binh Khe by the NVA managed to break                            through and while further word is not yet available are presumably on                            their way to Qui

probably with the two regimentsAbout 1200 Rangers from the PleikuKontum convoy have made it to Nha                            Trang The primary problem facing the MR                            2 command is finding sufficient equipment to refit the returning troops                            Some of the troops entering Nha Trang are relatively disciplined but                            others

virtually everything and North Vietnam has suffered very little You                                may wind up with this option: to pour in massive amounts of                                equipment

not tear the country apart again The Vietnam                                agreements were based on two things: our threat of military support                                and the continuation of aid In July 73 we stopped our support and                                we also cut the aid below the minimum they needed Now we are faced                                with a desperate situation I

telegram                                67019 to Phnom Penh March 25 are in the National Archives RG 59 State Archiving System1 To adopt military format believe it would be helpful to recapitulate                            essential points in exchanges we have had with Department in messages                            referenced above Ref A recommended that in the event of a negative vote                            by the US Congress on further assistance to Cambodia we act promptly                            to reduce overall number of persons for whose evacuation we are                            responsible by moving out approximately 225 persons by fixed wing assets                            immediately This recommendation was based on assumption that such a                            negative vote would cause morale on the GKR side to deteriorate so rapidly as to constitute a                            collapse and that an Eagle Pull extraction would then become                            necessary2 Ref B rejected this recommendation and instructed me to inform                                Lon Nol following a decisive                            congressional vote against supplementary assistance that the US                            Mission will continue to function normally to administer the ongoing aid                            shipments and that we have no present plans to evacuate official                            Americans In an FYI section this                            message noted that the mood in Phnom Penh after an aid cutoff may not                            permit us to hold to this posture on evacuation for very long but that                            I should not order any evacuation without receiving final authorization                            from Washington except in extremis meaning a situation where American                            lives are in immediate danger and I am unable to contact                            Washington3 Ref C asked my views for planning purposes on feasibility of beginning                            to reduce further the number of people included in evacuation plan                            without detracting from our operations and without arousing or                            contributing to GKR concern especially                            in absence of definitive action by the Congress4 Ref D expressed the view that we were receiving conflicting signals                            from the Department on EE planning                            I pointed out that we had                            already made reductions of people included in our evacuation plan that                            we could make further reductions in the persons over whom we have                            control employees and VOLAG                            personnel without detracting unduly from our operations but if we did                            so it would arouse GKR concern and would                            degrade the posture of unflinching support and steadfastness that the                            Mission was under instructions from Washington to project I also noted                            that the largest groups for which we are responsible are either not                            under our control or are groups whose size we can only estimate VIPs                            and Khmer employees of the USG5 Ref E stated that there are no conflicting signals because we were                            only being asked for our views6 I believe conditions have changed significantly since the above                            exchanges so that we need to take another look at this whole question                            The following are new factors to be considered:A The US Congress may simply fail to act on the administrations                            request so that there may be no definitive congressional vote against                            further assistance to Cambodia Even a favorable vote may provide too                            little and too lateB The assistance pipeline is running dry Today we have about a tenday                            supply of rice incountry As for ammunition the following projections                            are extracted from a message prepared yesterday by MEDTC 200500Z Mar 75 which I am having                            repeated to the Department:April 6Ammo stocks at depots incountry will decline to an                                average of 15 days of supply 6000 short tonsApril 11All airdrops to enclaves must terminate due to lack of                                funds for further aerial delivery equipmentApril 20Expanded bird air delivery of MAP supplies will terminate owing to lack of                                fundsApril 25Ammo stocks on hand in Cambodia will reach zero rpt zero balanceMEDTC estimates that FANKs will to fight could collapse                            between April 6 and 17 By the former date it will become apparent to                                FANK that ammo deliveries are not                            keeping pace with depot issues By the latter date zero balances in                            certain critical lines will occur MEDTC comments that FANK                            can reasonably be expected to crack well before the shelves are                            completely bareC Pochentong may be interdicted at any time FANK his failed to retake Toul Leap the KC have broken through the North Dike                            defense line and could bring Pochentong within mortar range shortly                            That would mean the end of the airliftD The Neak LoeungBanam enclave may fall any day now This event would                            release perhaps as many as 8000 KC                            troops to move north to attack the southern and southeastern perimeters                            of Phnom Penh which are only                            lightly defended FANK has no reserves                            to strengthen such a threatened area of the perimeterE The Khmers are watching developments in South Vietnam and many see a                            similar fate awaiting them Both our military and SRF personnel who have close contact with                            Khmers are reporting an increasing level of antiAmerican sentiment                                GKR and FANK morale may collapse even before or in the absence of                            negative action by the US Congress7 I believe we need to reconsider our EE posture Ref B was written at a time when it was                            believed that the congressional decision would come when there were                            supplies still in the pipeline to be delivered and that we had the                            capability of delivering them In light of our present circumstances I                            wish to make two recommendations for the Departments consideration:A That we begin now to move out of country selectively a small number                            but steady flow of personnel included in our evacuation plan with whose                            services we can dispense for example some of the TCNs who work on ammunition logistics                            There would be a calculated risk that this movement would have an                            adverse effect on Khmer morale but I would hope it would not have a                            major impact Our overall presence would still be very large and highly                            visible We can of course do nothing about reducing the numbers in                            categories over which we have no controlB That we again give consideration to moving out some two hundred or                            more persons by fixed wing assets as the first step of an evacuation as                            proposed in Ref A on the assumption that we have been authorized to                            proceed with Eagle Pull That means that once Eagle Pull has been                            authorized the largest contingent possible would use fixed wing assets                            taking advantage of surprise element The balance would be extracted by                            helicopter Obviously this scenario assumes availability of Pochentong                            airport Securing of airport by US military would not be required for                            this initial movement8 Request that this message be repeated to CINCPAC and COMUSSAG                            as this reexamination of our situation grew out of discussions we had                            with Admiral Gayler and LtG                                Burns when they visited here                            March 29Dean	19750331

Secto 187This reference is in error In telegram Secto 178428 not Secto 187                            from Jerusalem March 12 Sisco                            passed the following instructions to Sonnenfeldt and Hyland: Secretary would like your analysis of recent                            Soviet moves and your judgment as to whether these amount to a pattern                            Secretary mentioned in particular: the tone of Soviet reply on CSCE the absence of a reply to his offer                            to meet with Gromyko their                            sending their Geneva PermRep Vinogradov around the Middle East without prior notice                            or discussion with us and the reply on SALT Believe you should also have a look at Soviet press                            treatment in general as well as in particular to the Middle East                            Ibid For the Secretary from Sonnenfeldt and Hyland1 Our basic estimate is that collapse of Trade Bill following unexpected                        backlash in the US against Vladivostok led to a review of Soviet policy                        and a limited shift to a less conciliatory posture in dealing with us This                        has been reflected both in the stiffer tone of Soviet communications to us                        and in their positions in CSCE SALT the Middle East and Cyprus2 Since this period also coincided with Brezhnevs long absence and Dobrynins return for an alleged policy review we were                        inclined to speculate that a more extensive change and further hardening                        might be in store perhaps associated with circumscribing of Brezhnevs freedom of action and                        authority3 In the past few weeks however we have not detected any particular                        pattern in Soviet moves and statements that would point to a major change                        beyond that initiated at the time of the Trade Bill On each of the issues                        the Soviets seem to be following tactics that were more or less predictable                        last winter and that flow largely from nature of issues rather than                        concerted effort to shift to a new policy line4 On CSCE the tone of the last                            letterSee Document                                135 and footnote 3 thereto is curt and hectoring                        moreover it ignores several other issues raised in our communicationDocument 133 On                        the other hand at Vladivostok Brezhnev had already begun to intensify the                        effort to complete CSCE This must now                        seem within reach and he is determined to nail it down once and for all                        The reasons are the obvious ones The desultory discussions and prolonged                        haggling have robbed the conference of some of its value to the Soviets                        With other schemes afoot including WW II celebrations meeting of European                        Communists Brezhnevs travels                        etc it is not surprising that Soviets including Brezhnev personally are increasingly                        irritated and frustrated by their inability to get a firm Western                        commitment Also Soviets must realize that as long as CSCE remains open it is a hostage against                        their behavior elsewhere including the Middle East5 We also feel that the Soviets are becoming more worried about Europe The                        Soviets have never been as happy with SchmidtGenscher as                        with BrandtScheel On top of that CDU gains in FRG Land elections and the critical impact of elections in                        Westphalia could at some point lead to CDUCSU return to power Given the                            CDU position on CSCE and even on the interpretation of the                        Eastern treaties the Soviets would naturally be worried about such a change                        in German governments This concern would be greater in light of lessened                        weight of French influence over Bonn under Giscard compared with the                            DeGaullePompidou era6 In this connection return of Abrasimov as Ambassador to East Berlin may reflect a                        decision to maintain tighter controls over Berlin developments and over                        GDRFRG relationship7 In addition there is probably some dismay in Moscow over the crisis of                        capitalism and what it means they must be encouraged by a weakening of the                        Western coalition by divisiveness of energy issues by the collapsing                        southern flank of NATO At the same time                        they are also concerned that internal instabilities not lead to a return to                        1930s8 On SALT we think that the negotiations                        in Geneva are about where we expected The Soviets opening position was of                        course the old tactic of trying to squeeze out a few more gains than                        warranted by Vladivostok                        Nevertheless Soviets have also wanted us to table a draft and then to begin                        more systematic work They will study our draft and probably send some new                        instructions9 Until then it is difficult to say how serious the differences may be                        though of course we have anticipated that there will be major resistance on                        Backfire ASMs and intricate MIRV verification The only new note in the                        last week was the apparent lack of urgency in Soviet comments which had been                        a theme at opening of negotiations This may reflect less about SALT than about timing of Brezhnev visit10 Indeed lack of precise timetable on the visit is becoming an interesting                        indicator in itself You will recall Gromykos stout refusal in Geneva to mention it in the                        communiqu Soviets seem to be holding back and it may be that commitment                        on CSCE has become a precondition to                        setting a date for the visit It thus may be that Soviets have relaxed in                            SALT on the grounds that they have                        longer period for bargaining But this could change if a commitment is made                        on CSCE Note:                        There is in fact a good deal to recommend a late summer or autumn Brezhnev visit: 1 have time for SALT: 2 more incentive for Soviet restraint                        if CSCE ends by July 3 scheduling                        problems11 In the TTB talks Soviets seem to be                        moving toward US position and taking position that talks should be                        finished soon In effect Morokhov                        has accepted in principle a low fissionyield limit on excavation PNEs a yield limit of 150 kt on contained PNEs and the need for observers Given the clear evidence that                            Morokhov conducts these                        negotiations on his own it is doubtful that this development reflects a                        leadership decision on the technical specifics It is likely however that                            Morokhov is operating under some                        overall political guidance to work seriously toward wrapping up the TTBPNE                        issue by the time of the next summit12 In MBFR we have rather good                        intelligence that Soviets are stalling pending CSCE They anticipate the introduction of Option III and are                        worried by the difficulties in handling it Since Brezhnev is on record favoring an                        agreement in 1975 the Soviets may want to move later this year13 On other arms control security issuesenvironmental modification and                        chemical weaponsSoviets are behaving reasonably They are not agitating                        against us on CW in Geneva and want to wrap                        up the CCD rather quickly Environmental                        warfare talks here in Washington also went about as expected an agreement                        could probably be reached whenever a highlevel decision is made14 On substance of CSCE the Soviets are                        continuing to dribble out modest concessions15 In short we can see that Soviets are clearly becoming more difficult to                        deal with but their position is not notably harder than it might have been had there been no setback on                        trade They have a clear selfinterest in preserving an element of dtente                        in Europe and in pursuing SALT and in                        registering gains for Brezhnevs                        peace program at 25th Party Congress Hardening of Soviet policy if it                        comes therefore is more likely to be in reaction to significant                        deterioration in our position or in response to developments in the Middle                        East or on the Trade Bill On the latter the decline in emigration and                        the more caustic comments by Alkhimov suggest the Soviets may have greatly                        lowered their expectations for any serious movementOn March 5 Izvestia published                            an interview with Vladimir S Alkhimov Soviet Deputy Minister of                            Foreign Trade who had recently returned from a meeting in New York of                            the Executive Committee of the USUSSR Trade and Economic Council The Embassy in Moscow                            reported on the interview in telegram 2996 March 6 National Archives                                RG 59 Central Foreign Policy Files                            For the condensed English text see Current Digest of                                the Soviet Press Vol XXVII No 9 March 26 1975 p                            7 However Alkhimov in Izvestia claims                        that you explained to his group the measures the administration was                        undertaking to fulfill our pledges Moreover when Alkhimov was here he                        made clear Soviets will not default on obligatory July 1975 LendLease                        installment or unravel business facilitation they have undertaken since                        1972 We also note the alacrity with which the Soviets accepted the                            Robinson visit and pressed for                            Simon and the US Senators to                        come Soviets are thus not burning trade bridges no doubt because they                        still consider them beneficial16 On the Middle East the Soviets continue to be very critical about                        partial solutions and oneman diplomacy but have avoided substantive                        comment on the Middle East negotiations References to your role are                        however becoming more explicit and with clearly disapproving overtones                        There are numerous assertions that the Western press is exaggerating the                        potential of the present round of talks but there is no clear effort made                        to disrupt or derail them in Soviet commentary17 The Soviet public position remains essentially that enunciated by                            Brezhnev in his February 14                        comments to Wilson minus the                        criticism on soporifics which has disappeared:Partial accords and separate agreements will not guarantee implementation of                            UN decisions or restore peace to the                        area They are useful only as integral parts of a total MidEast                        settlementResolution of the Palestinian question is a sine qua non and requires some                        form of Palestinian national administration on the West Bank Most suitably                        the PLO should form it in keeping with the                        Arab decision at RabatSpeedy resumption of the Geneva Conference is the only way to ensure                        substained momentum toward an allembracing solution18 The focus of Soviet attention at the moment is unquestionably the                        Palestinian factor Perhaps in this connection two Soviet factfinding                        missions have just turned up in the area Vinogradov arrived in Damascus MondayMarch 10 and on the 11th was received by the                        Jordanian Prime Minister in Amman Moscow did not announce the visit The                        Egyptian Embassy in Amman reported that Vinogradov might attempt to achieve a reconciliation                        between Jordan and the PLO sic This is a sensitive source More probably he                        is gathering facts for Gromyko to                        use if he meets you19 Simultaneously a Soviet AfroAsian Solidarity Organization delegation                        headed by Victor Kudryavtsev is in Damascus and Beirut ostensibly to                        discuss Palestinian issues with the PLO                        The AASO is normally the PLOs host when the latter visits the USSR and a Soviet Parliamentary delegation                        was in Amman prior to Vinogradovs                        arrival20 Thus the Soviets may be seriously groping for an approach to the                        Palestinian issuewhich they insist remains the crux of any successful                        defusing of the Middle East crisis Evidently this is the one area where                        they see leeway for themselves regardless of the outcome of your trip In                        any event they appear to be acting on the assumption that as one prominent                        Soviet commentator wrote last week US diplomacy does not intend to prompt                        Tel Aviv to embark on talks about the Palestinian issue or take it upon                        itself to find a solution until at least 1977 after the US elections and                        as a result there is already a trend toward freezing this key problem The                        factfinding missions suggest that Moscow is determined to block any                        inclinations toward such a freeze and hopes to use the PLO as its instrument21 Soviet agitation in public and behind the scenes with Makarios is well                        known to you In recent days however our impression is that Soviets have                        decided to go along with whatever scheme seems most likely to put them on                        majority side in New York Obviously formal role for Waldheim has appeal for Soviets since it                        gives them at least indirect influence over talks In any case it is not                        our impression that Soviets have any clear line on the issues other than to                        maneuver to keep some influence in Athens Ankara and Nicosia and block a                        settlement arranged by you22 Developments in Southeast Asia have been virtually ignored in Soviet                        propaganda and there is no sense of gloating But Cambodian developments                        have probably caught Soviets off guard and created a dilemma since they                        have maintained their Embassy in Phnom Penh In this connection we note                        surprise visit by Firyubin to Hanoi                        and Vientiane this week on what is probably mission to inform Soviet                            leadership what future holds                        for them Obviously Soviets will pay careful attention to Congressional                        outcome if only as indicators of strength of executive and mood of this                        country They cannot be pleased at prospect of return of Sihanouk who told AFP today that China is Cambodias best friend23 In general a degree of Soviet irritability with us is not surprising in                        view of the buffeting their dtente line has taken and particularly since                        they may be grappling with their own leadership problems They are clearly                        trying to show that Brezhnev is                        operating normally again and will continue to do so through the US and                            CSCE summits We have no new evidence                        of leadership instability but still think it likely that succession question                        has been opened and may have to be resolved before the Party Congress24 Our sense of present Soviet attitude is that they are watching us                        unusually closely and are particularly sensitive to any indication that we                        are not living up to past promises Obviously they are well served in                        dealing with us and the Congress by taking a stance of the injured party                        But the top leaders surely have a genuine concern about whether the US                        side can sustain a policy of dtente25 We expect that over the coming weeks and indeed for the balance of the                        year the Soviets will be probing us more sharply and weighing more                        carefully their overall attitude toward us Specifically we should be                        prepared for: serious problems if we do not produce a CSCE summit by July increased troublemaking                        on the Middle East particularly on the PLO perhaps mild pressures on Berlin issues and growing pressure                        on the administration to show it is able or at least willing to produce a                        turnaround on trade legislation26 More basically whatever the fluctuations in style and tone we think it                        unlikely that the Soviets have changed their overall perception of their                        interests Even if their more ambitious expectations concerning economic and                        technological cooperation have had to be lowered they must know that a                        broadly positive relationship with us is essential After all their                        economic problem China Eastern Europe and the other factors that led to                        the decisions of 1971 have not significantly changed This is not to say                        that they could not change: major blows to the US position in Southeast                        Asia and the Eastern and Western Mediterranean the likely disenchantment of                        China with us that this might entail domestically immobilized US                        administration failure or frustration on CSCE SALT PNEs and other negotiating projects with                        which Brezhnev is identified                        economic disruption and hence political turbulence in the industrialized                        world not to mention the outbreak of a new Middle East warall this and                        more could represent such fundamental change in the world environment that                        even the inert Soviet leaders would be bound to take notice to see what                        historic opportunities beckoned This merely goes to show that USSoviet relations do not occur in a vacuum                        and that a dtente that is in our interest cannot be isolated from the                        rest of our policies For now however whatever the evidence of Soviet                        irritation and brittleness we do not see a sea change in Soviet                            conductIn telegram Tosec 80262810 to                                Kissinger in Jerusalem

             optimistic While we think our basic analysis is sound we may                            underestimate the adverse impact of an accumulation of actual and

pass to Pat Holt Chief of Staff                        Senate Foreign Relation CMTE Subj: Senator McGoverns Meeting With Yasir                            Arafat1 I wish to advise you that I and two staff aides met in Beirut for over one                        hour evening Mar 28 with PLO Chairman                            Yasir Arafat Following for your                        personal information are salient points of our discussions2 Arafat initially gave long                        exposition re bases and purposes of Palestinian cause and Fedayeen movement                        dwelling heavily on his peoples sufferings etc and pointing out that                        despite emotional trauma experienced by Palestinians PLO leadership has refrained from                        overbidding He said steps PLO leadership                        has taken have been realistic and well as bold and courageous                        Traditional Palestinian leaders he said used to offer slogans which                        offended international opinion but PLO                        leadership now adopts realistic positions As example he noted that                        Palestine National Council in June 1974 had decided to welcome opportunity                        to establish national authority over any piece of Palestinian land liberated                        from Israeli control3 Arafat said PLO foresees democratic secular state as                        vision of future but it realizes this is longterm objective which                            PLO hopes to achieve through                        intellectual transformation and political persuasion When IA asked if territories to form the basis                        for an independent Palestinian state in context of some overall peace                        settlement meant West Bank and Gaza Arafat replied yes He described his vision of                        democratic secular state as benefitting both Israelis and Palestinians He                        believed that if Israelis do not succumb wholly to a masada complexA reference to the Roman siege of the ancient                            fortress at Masada during the First JewishRoman War from 6670 AD                            According to the ancient Jewish historian Josephus a group of Jewish                            extremists known as the Sicarii seized the fortress at the start of the                            war in 66 AD After the Romans conquered Jerusalem in 70 AD                            effectively ending the war they lay siege to the last bastion of Jewish                            resistance at Masada In 72 AD with the Romans on the brink of taking                            the fortress the leaders of the Sicarii opted to commit suicide rather                            than surrender to the Romans they will come to accept this                        concept as their vision also and would allow themselves to become part of                        our area He considered this would be commensurate with Israeli interests                        since he thought it unlikely that USG would continue forever to provide                        enormous sums to sustain Israeli intransigence4 Discoursing further re strength and durability of Palestinian cause                            Arafat averred that Palestinians                        can sustain their struggle for 3050 years if necessary He said Palestinian                        people are not willing to remain as observers on periphery of history and                        that their revolution reflects dynamism of Palestinian people If things do                        not go well he said PLO leadership at                        some point would be forced to display greater extremism with leaders                        emerging who would be better than us and perhaps better for Palestinian                        people Current PLO proposals contended                            Arafat are neither violent nor                        extreme but realistic He added that if Palestinians do not achieve                        stability the area will not achieve stability5 When IA asked what specific arrangements might cause PLO to agree to be represented at Geneva                            Arafat said this question was                        less important at present time than terms of reference of PLO participation6 Asked again if he would agree to two coequal states of Israel and                        Palestine latter comprising West Bank and Gaza which would recognize each                        others existence Arafat reiterated                        that official Palestinian National Council position is to establish national                        authority over any territory that could be made availableeven one                        village He then intimated that PLO would                        accept territorial division based on 1967 lines but he warned that PLO leadership has had to struggle hard to get                        Palestinian people to acquiesce in this arrangement When I asked if                        extremists might disrupt any ME settlement                        based on such an arrangement Arafat                        said it would rpt not because this is the                        Palestinian consensus One of his interjected: some of the theoreticians                        are sometimes backward from the historical process7 I pointed out that terrorist attacks like the Mar 5 raid on Tel Avivs                        Savoy HotelSee footnote                                2 Document 139 create political difficulties for                        Americans who sympathize with Palestinian aspiration In reply Arafat asked why it is that terrorism by                        people who live as we do is condemned while UN member state which murders our leaders in their homes is                        not accused of similar or worse terrorism8 Asked again about PLO representation at                        Geneva Arafat said Sadat has not raised this issue with him                        Asked again if PLO would agree to go to                        Geneva he said PLO would await invitation                        and examine terms of reference before deciding In any case Arafat noted PLO is not interested in Geneva as cover for further                        procrastination9 I said that while I could not rpt not                        speak for Secretary Kissinger it                        was my impression that you would be interested in meeting with Arafat at some point in future I told him                        at least this was my impression prior to recent suspension of your                        stepbystep peace mission Arafat                        nodded and added smilingly: Dr Kissinger delivered a meaningful warning to the Israelis                        when he visited Masada following breakdown of peace talks10 I called attention to enormous fear which influences Israelis and many of                        their American supporters As friend of Israel and one who believes Israel                        should and will survive I said I hoped Israelis would overcome their fear                        of reaching accommodation with Palestinians In this connection Arafat noted his UNGA speechA reference to                                Arafats November 13 1974                            speech to the UN General Assembly A transcript of Arafats speech is in the New York Times November 14 1974 p 22                        had been followed by orchestrated efforts by Zionist leaders in US to                        portray his words as containing something which was not in themie as                        threat to destroy Israel11 Arafat said he had asked King                            Faisal night before he was                            assassinatedKing Faisal was assassinated on March 25                            1975 by Faisal bin Musaiid the son of the kings half brother

Resurgence Party                        announced by Shah March 2 is move to seek broader support for Monarchy and                        the ShahPeople Revolution All Iranians of voting age are expected to                        express allegiance to new party or risk being viewed as opponents of Shah                        and even traitors who should leave Iran or go to prison Shah explained                        Irans return to single party system as necessary because shameful                        utterances by some Iranians showed need for Iranians to close ranks in                        effort to achieve great civilization and because opposition parties had                        failed Elections scheduled for summer will apparently be held but it is                        not clear how they will be organized Net result is to make Iranian                        political system less flexible International reaction will probably range                        from indifference to charges of increased totalitarianism Shah apparently                        plans to continue active involvement in daily political affairs This is                        contrary to earlier suggestions that he might be moving gradually to confine                        himself to broad policy guidance and leave implementation to government End summary1 Shahs lengthy statement at his March 2 press conference from which                        correspondents for foreign media were excluded text sent by airgramAirgram A42 from Tehran March 5 Ibid                            P7500490672 established Iranian Resurgence Party New party                        will absorb ruling Iran Novin Party loyal opposition Mardom Party and the                        ultranationalist Pan Iranist Party and its splinter group the Iranian                        Party Prime Minister Hoveyda is to                        be Secretary General for a period of at least two years Shah will later                        propose chairman of new partys executive board and president for its                        political bureau A party congress will be held perhaps within two months                        General elections will be held this summer under auspices of new party2 Shahs statement began with familiar recitation of Irans growing                        selfreliance and economic independence contrasting sharply with its                        relative weakness in first half of century He noted that opposition parties                        were created in response to his own wishes and commented that they had been                        faced with a difficult task Shah observed that they had failed to fulfill                        their proper role He commented that some Iranians had made shameful                        utterances which reflected a lack of understanding of Irans goals In                        order to weld all Iranians together in pursuit of goals of the ShahPeople Revolution he had therefore                        decided to create new organization which would suppress party differences                        Only requirements for membership in new organization would be loyalty to 1                        Monarchy 2 Irans constitution and 3 Sixth of Bahman ShahPeople                        Revolution He specifically said new party would foster constructive                        criticism and he predicted that political wings would evolve within new                        party He urged all Iranians eligible to vote to enter into new political                        structure or clarify their position By this he meant that those who could                        not agree with the three principles should leave Iran or go to prison as                        traitors unless they openly expressed their disapproval and were not                        antinational If disapproval is ideological person would remain free in                        Iran but should not have any expectations Full participation in Irans                        progress would obviously require membership in the Iran Resurgence Party He                        said it was his expectation that workers farmers and teachers would be the                        first groups to announce their loyalty to the new party3 Comment: Above all Shahs action in returning to                        single party system of 196467 period shows his extreme sensitivity to                        criticism and strong desire to receive overt evidence of popular support                        After he experimented with tame opposition parties in 195664 period with                        poor results Shah then turned to Hassan Ali Mansurs Progressive Society to                        create Iran Novin Party as instrument to implement his Sixth of Bahman                        Revolution Mardom Party was subsequently rejuvenated to stimulate Iran                        Novin to perform more effectively Despite constant statements of loyalty to                        Shah and his plans for Iran parties have apparently not pleased him As                        indicated by failures of former Mardom Party Secretaries General Ali Naqi                        and Nasser Ameri even activities of gelded opposition had proved too                        critical for Shahs taste Nevertheless his past statements indicated                        continuing support for concept of multiparty system in Iran and Imperial                        decision to institute oneparty state represents 180degree shift in policy                        which also appears to negate earlier promises of freer elections later this                        year Key section of speech is comment that he had heard some really                        shameful utterances which in no way should be expected from an Iranian                        This scene of course has always recurred when Iran has been engaged in the                        defence of its rights at a historic juncture This situation is                        intolerable Under these circumstances we doubt that much constructive                        criticism will emerge from the Iranian Resurgence Party4 In operational terms little has changed for despite facade of metoo                        opposition parties Shah has always called the tune and only ruling Iran                        Novin Party had any importance Prime Minister has been lead dancer and his                        selection as SecGen at January party congress had tied Iran Novin Party even                        closer to Shah Immediate consequence of new move has been flood of                        statements of loyalty to Shah constitution and revolution both by groups                        and individuals There is clearly no viable alternative for Iranians who want to participate                        actively in Irans development and share its prosperity All differences of                        view on how to implement Shahs plan for Iran will be suppressed until new                        party develops an ideology and its leadership is constituted5 Shahs speech is vague on goals of Iranian Resurgence Party and many other                        points It is not clear for example how candidates will be selected for                        summer elections and on what platforms they will run Speech shows signs of                        hurried preparation for issuance prior to his departure for Algiers While                        most Iranians will accept new change with typical cynicism implied                        criticism of all parties for failing to get behind Shahs push for                        revolution from the top may alienate some people particularly those who                        have worked hard for Iran Novin Party on assumption they were carrying out                        Shahs wishes6 International reaction will probably vary from indifference to                        increasingly shrill charges of totalitarianismDIA Defense Intelligence Notice                            DIADIN 50075 March 4 observed that Iranians have recently become                            increasingly sensitive to criticisms in the US press concerning                            authoritarian rule in Iran massive purchases of US arms and Iranian                            investment in US business This open disavowal of multiparty politics                            will almost certainly cause additional outcries in the US It                            speculated that the Shah has obviously reached the conclusion that his                            petrodollars being sought by both the US and USSR can override ideological                            convictions and assure Iranian independence from superpower restraints

unless new partys membership comes                        from broad spectrum It appears that earlier successful Iranian policy of                        compromise and cooperation has been replaced

              P7500272355 Embassy noted that Shah hopes to move toward                        situation in which he gives policy guidance but keeps his distance from                        daily activities of government Initial impression of his action in creating                        new political party and forecasting his personal selection of some of its                        leaders is that he has returned to more direct involvement in the business                        of government Better judgment on this point can be made when function of                        new party becomes clear8 In sum given existing strict degree of political controls Shahs                        decision to meld all political parties into one appears to offer little in                        way of

                    with skepticism Saddam has by embracing Shah made major gamble at time                        when extremist elements of Baath are increasingly vocal in opposition to

effective control along borders to end all subversive                        infiltration from either side6 Above three arrangements are indivisible elements of comprehensive

15 to establish work                        arrangements for mixed commission to implement agreement8 Shah accepted invitation to visit Iraq and Saddam to visit Iran9 Comment:Saddam Hussein giving up of Iraqi                        territory on Shatt alArab without even facesaving device of prior                        negotiated treaty is major concession and best illustration of his                        determination to end Iranian assistance to Kurds even at risk of his own                        position Another Iraqi concession was absence of any mention of Iranian                        seizure of Tunbs and Abu Musa Demarcation of border has never been a major                        problem but only symptom of deeper differences10 Shah on other hand appears to have gotten what he wanted on Shatt                        alArab in return for controlling of border to end all subversive                        infiltration which for GOI means end of                        assistance to Kurdish insurgency a policy to which he has never admitted                        Given Baath track record and Shahs past behavior and opinion of Baath                        regime there is good reason for doubting that accord will be fully                        implemented For example does Shah seriously intend to end all aid to Kurds                        and permit Iraqi forces to destroy them or was he pressured into agreement                        by Boumediene Sadat et al and by                        desire for OPEC solidarity Time will                        tell11 In Iraqi context Saddam Hussein                        has shown real political courage Even before signing of accord there was                        evidence of growing discontent within Baath Party particularly national                        panArab leadership over Saddams gradual moderation of Iraqs policy                        toward Palestinians his rapprochement with West and conservative

negotiations in Algiers with Saddam Hussein Ibid D75008211311 The continuing attack of Iraqi forces against the Kurds puts the Shahs                        agreements reached at Algiers in possible jeopardy The question of why the                        Shah took this gamble and put himself in this embarrassing position bears an                        effort at explanation2 As we have pointed out in earlier telegrams the Shah has wanted for years                        to get rid of the 1937 treaty provisions on the Shatt alArab This issue                        has assumed an importance in his mind out of all proportion to how others                        would see it Since Iraqi Vice President Saddam                            Hussein publicly agreed in the presence of several Arab                        chiefs of state that the Shatt alArab frontier should be defined on the                        basis of the thalweg this concession which even Nuri Said always                        rejected has become a matter of international public record It will                        strengthen Irans de jure position even if Saddam Hussein should renege when it comes to the actual                        negotiation of a new treaty Any future regime in Iraq would also be in a                        better position to accept the thalweg as a de jure frontier because of the                        precedent of its having been publicly accepted by a government with radical                        Arab nationalist credentials To get this acceptance the Shah gave up his                        Kurdish card doubtless beyond possibility of recovery He probably did                        not anticipate that Saddam Hussein                        immediately would violate the letter and spirit of their Algiers agreement                        by ordering an allout attack on the Kurds on all fronts Faced with the                        fact however the Shah whatever he may think privately seems disposed to                        accept the Iraqi claim that their forces only have been defending themselves                        against Kurdish attacks To do otherwise would be to acknowledge that                            Saddam Hussein successfully                        tricked him Since the Shah decided he could not risk further direct                        involvement in Iraq he must pretend not to know the Iraqis are deliberately                        violating their Algiers agreement3 Normally the Shah is prudent and careful when taking actions In this case                        he appears to have moved precipitately According to Uri Lubrani unofficial                        Israeli Ambassador here Iranian political and military officials first learned of the accords with                            Saddam Hussein when the Shah                        stepped off the plane from Algiers and started issuing orders Minister of                        Court Alam in a conversation                        Thursday morning emphasized again how much the Shah wanted the accord on                        the Shatt alArab Clearly the Government of Iran is now confronted with                        behavior on the part of Saddam                            Hussein which according to those knowledgeable of Baathist                        mentality is running true to form These individuals wonder why the Shah                        who knows Arabs well permitted himself to be boobytrapped To them the                        Shatt alArab question was not that important but as pointed out above it                        probably was that important to the Shah4 Lubrani asked Wednesday evening for my interpretation of the Shahs moves                        on Iraq In addition to mentioning the factors outlined above but without                        attribution I pointed out that there was no indication Iran was moving                        closer to the radical Arabs or to the Arab states for that matter The                        Shah takes pleasure these days in quoting a remark made by President Sadats                        advisor Ashraf Marwan on his last                        visit to Tehran to the effect We Egyptians are fed up with the Arabs                        Also there is no indication that the Shah is more trusting of the Iraqis                        than he was before He simply wants to hold on to the Shatt alArab                        agreement A byproduct of his embarrassment over the Iraqi attack on the                        Kurds will undoubtedly be a scrupulous adherence to any kind of undertakings                        he has made to other countries In other words his sense of pride could not                        afford to have it said that after letting down the Kurds which he did not                        intend but which he risked he had now abrogated some other agreements                        Lubrani was pensive about this observation then agreed that psychologically                        it was probably true in the Shahs case He then said that he could not                        envisage the Iraqis withdrawing many troops from the Kurdish front for a                        long time to come and that therefore the military balance visvis Israel                        would not be particularly affected He figures that the Iraqis will try to                        Arabicize the Kurdish area as rapidly as possible but this obviously will                        take time His primary concern appeared to be whether Iran was getting                        closer to radical Arab nations He seemed somewhat reassured by my                        remarksHelms	19750313

of                        genocide against Kurds he would ask US help and possibly ask for                            asylumIn telegram 303 from Baghdad March                            24 the Interests Section argued against giving refuge to Barzani and                            his associates since the Iraqi Government was finally convinced that no                            US aid had

             resumption Lowrie observed                            that Saddam had risked much in shifting policy toward Iran and making a                            concession on the Shatt alArab displeasing the Kurds the ICP the Soviets Baath extremists and                            his enemies Therefore Saddams vague responses during the interview                            reflected the difficulty of new positions on sensitive issues such as                            USIraqi relations until he has assured support for Iranian accord                            Ibid D75010204502 Pace

         near Ashman some 20 kilometers north of Piranshahr Khaneh now also being                        used Movement along this route is slow due to winter snows which would                        argue need for extension of amnesty period past April 1 to facilitate                        travel Extension of amnesty would have to be done by Iraqi Government which                        announced it Many Kurdish refugees with professional backgrounds eg                        engineers doctors are congregating in Rezaieh and have expressed to                        newsmen their hopes of seeking refuge in US4 Two Kurdish refugees visited Embassy March 23 asking to go to US They                        confirmed that Barzani had counseled Kurds to surrender to Iraqis or flee to                        Iran In their opinion almost all members of Pesh Merga 60000 and militia                        40000 would flee to Iran because Kurds had heard that some who had tried                        to surrender near Zozak Mountain had been fired upon There were also reports that Iraqis are keeping Kurds who                        had surrendered in concentration camps Thus most Kurds saw no alternative                        to fleeing to Iran although they did not trust Iran very much either In                        their view Iran had withdrawn munitions supplies and artillery support                        leaving Kurds to their fate and might some day force Kurds back across                        border when it no longer wanted to support them Both men are

many                        Kurds were farmers and shepherds who would not want to live in US or Western                        countries and would probably stay in Iran But they said there would be many                        young people like themselves who would want to go to US to escape                        persecution and seek work5 On humanitarian assistance: Pace reported doctor and two

          Kurds and has said Kurds will not be forced to return to Iraq Refugees are                        clearly skeptical at least over longer run but most have nowhere else to                        go Large number Kurdish males of working age may cause serious problems                        wherever camps located Kurdish member Iranian Parliament told EmbOff there was already some friction

to avoid contact with Iranian Kurds Kurds would not like                        this because climate and terrain are greatly different from what they are                        used to Money to

principle                        probability of Kurdish defeat in absence of increased Iranian assistance                        threat to Irans OPEC leadership internal                        problems and GOIs perception of change in                        Middle East We think these considerations sufficiently strong to sustain                        Irans determination to do its part for extended period to carry out its                        accord with Iraq There is already evidence to support this analysis in                        Irans attitude toward Barzani and his followers End                            summary1 IranIraq Accord plainly one of more significant events in Irans recent                        diplomacy raises two questions Based on previous hostility how long can                        Accord be expected to last Secondly does Accord signify basic shift in                        Irans orientation towards Middle Eastern states As background for                        approaching these questions we think there were five considerations which                        led Iran to conclude Accord with Iraq:A The thalweg Clearly when offered longsought and psychologically                        important thalweg as Shatt alArab boundary Iran could hardly refuse                        especially in presence of OPEC partners                        However Iran would not have been offered thalweg had it not made                        significant concession on its aid to Kurds Kurdish problem because of its                        high human costs appeared to have been on verge of causing serious                        difficulties for Baathists Iran already had workable de facto situation on                        Shatt alArab and to cause Shah to abandon his prime objective of shaking                        despised Baathist regime there must have been more powerful motivation than                        recognition of thalweg In other words we believe thalweg was more of a                        condition than a motive for the Accord Without thalweg there would have                        been no Accord but it was not sufficient reason in itself for Iran to                        conclude broad agreement with IraqB Termination of Kurdish fighting Against background of last years                        relatively successful Iraqi offensive against Kurds and prospect of another                        drive against them this spring Iran faced dilemma of either watching the                        Kurds defeated or substantially increasing military assistance and risking escalation to open war                        with IraqAccording to a memorandum from                                Ellsworth to Clements April 28 the Shah offered                            the risk of open warfare with Iraq to MAAG Chief Brett on                            April 21 as his motivation for reaching an accord with Saddam Hussein In a handwritten note                                Clements wrote:                            Interesting I dont agreeprobably more to do with Shahs idea of

the Shah                        wanted to become more deeply involved with the Kurds primarily because we                        do not believe he has unlimited confidence in capabilities of his army and                        he has said he had no great regard for ability of Kurds to withstand Iraqis                        Therefore his concession to Iraq was also a timely adjustment in Irans

     important for the Shah in order to prevent Saudi Arabia from assuming a                        foremost postion in OPEC and to enable                        Iran to exercise moderating influence against radical tendencies led by                        Algeria within organization Thus Algeria Iran and Iraq each for separate                        national reasons related to OPEC saw                        great benefit in Algiers AccordD Internal problems We have impression that Iranian leadership feels                        considerable irritation at continuing manifestations of internal dissent                        With obvious improvement in standard of living and prospects for greater                        progress over relatively short term persisting difficulties with unruly                        students and sporadic terrorism are source of frustration for GOI Shah has been told by Egypt Jordan and                        Algeria of greater moderation in Baathist outlook and possible Egyptianlike                        turning away from Soviets in Baghdad It would be major coup for GOI if Soviet influence in Iraq were broken                        Shah probably thought it was worth testing Iraqs willingness to limit                        support for subversion and propaganda against Iran just as he earlier did                        with USSR China and other Communist                        countries Moreover tensions with Iraq have never been popular with Iranian                        religious elements or leftwing students GOI was certainly not adverse to courting public favor on this                        issueE Middle East political flux There is an active search for new alignments                        in this region: Saudi Arabia and Arab oil countries are buying friends with                        large sums Egypts diplomacy seems more active and successful than ever                        Iraq is sending feelers to moderate states and US position on Israel                        seems subject to possible modification In these conditions of new                        opportunities and uncertain future Shah must feel it necessary to be on as                        friendly a footing as possible with his regional neighbors He certainly would not wish to see Iraq                        achieve a morally improved position in Arab world at Irans expense2 If foregoing analysis is correct we believe following consequences may be                        expected:A Iran will maintain its end of bargain and will be relatively patient with                        Iraq as it fills its obligations Facade of cooperation will be important                        for both regional and domestic reasons If thalweg were Irans only                        motivation Accord could be denounced on any pretext and Iran would have                        achieved its point with acceptance of thalweg principle by an Iraqi                        GovernmentB Main difficulty will be Iraqs treatment of the Kurds Iran has already                        been subjected to international criticism for abandoning that cause We                        believe that at least through this summer Iran will make a large effort to                        maintain Accord and let Kurds remaining in Iraq shift for themselves Border                        peace over next 68 months appears definitely in Irans interests because                        hostilities during summer and early fall could erupt into serious fighting                            OPECconsumers talks are in prospect                        and domestic scene must be put in order during period when new single party                        is being formed and Iranian elections are scheduledC Accord probably marks significant Iranian shift towards Egypt and Algeria                        without however fundamentally altering GOIs relationship with Israel As long as Israel remains                        militarily strong and able to absorb Arab energies we see definite Iranian                        interest in maintaining quiet mutually beneficial relationship with that                        state Israelis will be concerned however if as we anticipate there are                        increasing demonstrations of Iran affinity for Arab cause We suspect that                        Shah feels Arab states may be riding new crest of confidence and influence                        and he will wish to strengthen his ties in their direction3 There is already evidence of Iranian seriousness in maintaining Accord                        Prime Minister Hoveyda is to visit                        Iraq next week Iranian press carries optimistic reports of planning for                        pilgrimages to Iraqi Shiite shrines And Kurds are receiving absolutely no                        encouragement in their difficulties with Iraq In general publicly and                        privately Iranians are welcoming Accord as very positive achievement of                        regime4 Department may repeat this message as desired If assessment of Iranian                        motives is to be given to foreign governments we believe it should be                        carefully sanitized as we would not like to see unfavorable interpretation                        of Iranian motives reflected back to TehranHelms	19750325

frus1969-76v30d38	38 Telegram From the Department of State to the Mission to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the Embassy in Greece	None	1975-03-15 18:02:00	None	None	58882 Subject: Greece and NATO1 At present the allies are in a holding pattern on the Greek NATO relationship with the US and most                            other allies endorsing the view that the initiative on clarifying this                            relationship should be left to Greece Greece appears to want to delay                                NATO negotiations until the                            USGreek negotiations have moved further or indeed been completed We                            have come to the view however that it is appropriate to begin to move                            now to start the process of clarifying the Greek role in NATO for the following reasonsUSGreek bilateral negotiations can make some progress but are limited                            by the interconnection between the US bilateral role in Greece and                            Greeces NATO ties 10 lines not declassified The alternative to recommitment of                            forces to NATO bilateral USGreek                            arrangements not tied to NATO would                            pose serious problems with Congress and would have global implications                            as a precedent A second complex problem is posed by the fact that the                                NATO infrastructure program in                            Greece overlaps with US use of facilities there as for example at the                            Souda Bay airfield which is built with NATO funds In sum the bilateral negotiations with Greece                            can make progress on certain issues but cannot be wrapped up completely                            unless and until the Greek NATO role is                            clarifiedThere is also the broad question of the type of bilateral arrangements                            we want in Greece and the value we attach to US facilities there under                            various circumstances: if Greece is in NATOs military structure or if it has withdrawn or is in                            some intermediate category We can only approach this question in more                            specific terms as we have more appreciation for the likely future Greek                            role in NATOThe major question of a new Greek relationship with NATO as a precedent for other allies2 In addition there are internal pressures within the NATO context that are at work because of                            the ambiguous Greek role including:Infrastructurenew projects for Greece are frozen and work on previously                            approved projects is being disputed by Turkey More generally the issue                            of existing infrastructure facilities in Greece will need resolution                            and NATO claims against Greece are a                            possibility if a satisfactory resolution to the question of Greeces                            force commitment to NATO does not                            emergeTurkeys concerns over its communications and radarearly warning links                            with NATO which are subject to                            interruption by Greece Turkey has asked for development of alternative                            channels a costly and complex processAllied command arrangements for southeastern Europe The ambiguity                            concerning the Greek role was one factor in Turkeys decision to opt out                            of Wintex 75 the whole question is a central one for NATO military planners in planning                            southern flank defenseOverflight rights including over the Aegean3 Approach to GreekNATO                            negotiationsOur approach to these negotiations would be to encourage Greece                            ultimately to resume the fullest possible role in NATO at the same time seeking to avoid                            backing Greece prematurely into a corner that would make it formalize                            under pressure a low degree of participation closing the door on                            further integration into NATO The                            central issue in negotiations is likely to be the nature of the Greek                            force commitment to NATO The present NATO categories of assignment and                            earmarking involve for Greece some forces under NATO command and some other forces                            earmarked to be placed under NATO                            commanders in certain contingency situations We would of course prefer                            to see Greece come to restore its commitment under these categories We                            recognize however that this may pose political problems for the Greek                            Government since Caramanlis has renounced precisely these categories In                            this regard the redefinition of force commitment categories currently                            under study in NATO may be helpful to                            the GOG We will need a closer reading                            over time of the possibilities this recategorization exercise provides                            as well as the effect of possible Greek forceCommitments as a precedent for other allies We will wish to impress                            with other allies on Greece the need for a satisfactory resolution to                            this question4 Timing considerationsGreek domestic politics Greeces relations with Turkey and the Cyprus                            issue interact to place limits on how fast and perhaps how far Greece                            may be able to move in defining its role in NATO in the direction we desire An acceptable new                                GreeceNATO relationship will not                            quickly be defined we should be prepared for a slow possibly groping                            process During this period for the reasons stated above it may not be                            possible to bring our bilateral negotiations with Greece to a formal                            conclusion although we would seek to make tangible progress on                            individual issues5 For USNATO: You should approach                            Luns and drawing on paras 1 2 3 and 4 above explain that we believe                            it time to move to clarification of the Greek role in NATO making clear that we do not seek an                            adversary or unduly hasty process You should indicate that we prefer                            that Greece take the initiative though we believe that the process                            should be launched in any case in the next few weeks You should also                            outline the idea of initial discussions between Greece and a small group                            of allies which Luns might convoke pointing out that we recognize that                            a larger group including Turkey and all other DPC members would eventually have to take part in any                            decisions6 You are then authorized to approach at your discretion UK FRG and                            Italian

suggesting that this idea by raised with Greeks by one                            or more of these PermReps7 Once the approaches in paras 5 and 6 have been undertaken you should                            approach Greek PermRep Theodoropoulos along the following lines:We are interested in progress in USGreek negotiations which began in                            February and will continue to approach them with this goalHowever we are increasingly aware that the interconnection between the                            Greek role in NATO and USGreek                            bilateral defense arrangements is complex and pervasive Thus we cannot                            view the bilateral negotiations wholly in isolation from the                                GreekNATO

infrastructure It may                            be difficult to envisage new bilateral agreements or arrangements                            relating to NATOfunded facilities when

ally                            in isolationWe thus believe it is necessary to move toward clarifying the Greek role                            in NATO We would prefer for Greece to                            take the initiative in this regard We suggest as earlier that initial                            discussions could take place with Greece and a small group of

Minister                            explained that the decision was Giscards which he made because he and                                Sauvagnargues believed that:                            1

2Begin text: Dear Mr Minister:In response to your letter to me dated February 28 I have further considered                        carefully the arguments you put forward for sending out invitations to the                        preparatory meeting at this time My strong view remains however that we                        should wait until the requisite consumer solidarity is achieved before                        proceeding to make formal proposals for such a meetingIn support of this conclusion I want to take strong exception once again to                        the notion that the consumers ought to gear themselves to OPEC meetings This idea seems to be based on                        the premise that we cannot have a productive dialogue without taking                        measures to tranquilize the producers On the contrary as we explained in                        Martinique and subsequently the preparations among consumers for meetings                        with producers are the indispensable elements for a successful and                        constructive dialogue with the producers We intend to do our part in order                        to make the necessary preparations for such a meeting and indeed we look                        forward to making good progress on the major remaining issue at the next                        meeting of the IEA Governing Board                        scheduled for March 67Contrary to the suggestion that producing governments hope that the                        invitations will be issued prior to the Algiers summit several members of                            OPEC have indicated to us that they                        made no final decision on the timing and composition of a preparatory                        meeting Since Frances intention to issue an invitation to producers                        consumers and developing countries can be a mystery to no one it would                        seem prudent to delay issuance of                        the invitations themselves until the main parties in question have made a                        decision on the mode and timing of their participation To do otherwise                        would put at risk a process on which we both agree and which appears to be                        advancing properlyI recognize of course that the French Government may be in a position in its                        discussions with producers wherein you might consider it desirable even                        imperative to communicate with them before the OPEC summit meeting next week regarding invitations for the                        preparatory conference This may be possible with a communication that does                        not go to the point of a formal invitation to a preparatory meeting You                        could inform the producers of the likelihood that invitations would be                        forthcoming shortly for a preparatory meeting along the lines of the timing                        we discussed last week You might wish to relate this to the current status                        of deliberations in the IEA including the                        importance of the March 67 meeting as well as to the understanding reached                        with the United States at Martinique that proposals for holding a                        preparatory meeting would be contingent upon substantial progress among                        consumers in the fields of energy conservation financial solidarity and                        the development of new sources of energyOn                            March 3 Kissinger sent a                            message to Callaghan and                                Genscher regarding the                            conference invitations that France distributed on February 28 He                            relayed Sauvagnarguess                            justifications for sending them and told them of his previous efforts to                            prevent France from doing so until the requirements specified in the                            Martinique agreement and in the December 1920 IEA Governing Board decision had been satisfied He wrote:                            By issuing invitations before the OPEC meeting we risk formation of a united OPEC stand Algerias reaction suggests                            that this is just what is going to happen While he and Ford would do their utmost to avoid                            any public debate with the French over the issue Kissinger said he advised that the                                IEA Governing Board take no action                            on the French invitation until it reached final agreement on alternate                            sources He concluded: For our part we do not plan to respond to the                            French invitation until the established requirements are met Telegram                            46724 to London and Bonn March 3 ibid Box 15 United KingdomState                            Department Telegrams from SECSTATENODIS 3With best

THE SUBCOMITES ATTENTION ON THE DIFFICULT                            ISSUES WHICH WE BELIEVE MUST BE CONFRONTED BEFORE THE SUBCOMITE ATTEMPTS                            TO FORMALIZE ITS VIEWS ON THIS

THEREOF OF A RESTRICTIVE DATA DISSEMINATION POLICY7 WHILE A FEW DELS OPPOSED SUCH CONSIDERATION BY FAR THE GREATEST                            NUMBER WERE MOST INTERESTED IN THE INTERRELATIONSHIP OF TECHNICAL AND                            ORGANIZATIONAL ASPECTS OF SUCH REMOTE SENSING WITH THE DEVELOPMENT OF                            ANY NEW LEGAL STANDARDS BY FAR THE GREATEST NUMBER OF

TERMINOLOGY TO BE USED OR IN                            PRECISE SCOPE OR NATURE OF REMOTE SENSING ACTIVITIES TO BE COVERED BY                            THE LEGAL SUBCOMITES STUDY OF LEGAL IMPLICATIONS US SEVERAL TIMES PUT                            INTO THE RECORD OUR POSITION THAT THE SUBCOMITE WAS AND SHOULD BE                            CONSIDERING ONLY THE TYPES OF PROGRAMS WHICH FOR EXAMPLE NASA HAS BEEN EXPERIMENTING WITH OR MAY                            DEVELOP9 THE SUBCOMITE DID AGREE THAT SEVERAL COMMON ELEMENTS COULD BE FOUND IN                            EACH OF THE WRITTEN DRAFTS AND ORAL COMMENTS ON REMOTE SENSING AND THAT                            THOSE ARE AS FOLLOWS: A THAT REMOTE SENSING ACTIVITIES BY MEANS OF                            SPACE TECHNOLOGY SHOULD BE CONDUCTED FOR THE BENEFIT AND IN THE INTEREST                            OF ALL MANKIND THIS NEW TECHNOLOGY WOULD BE OF PARTICULAR SIGNIFICANCE                            TO DEVELOPING COUNTRIES IN THEIR PLANS AND PROGRAMMES FOR NATIONAL                            DEVELOPMENTB THAT REMOTE SENSING ACTIVITIES BY MEANS OF SPACE TECHNOLOGY SHOULD BE                            CONDUCTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH INTER NATIONAL LAW INCLUDING THE UNITED                            NATIONS CHARTER AND THE 1967 TREATY ON PRINCIPLES GOVERNING THE                            ACTIVITIES OF STATES IN

               SUBCOMITE ON THIS ITEM WAS THAT SOMEHOW OPEN DISSEMINATION OF DATA WOULD                            UNDERMINE THEIR ABILITY TO MAINTAIN CONTROL OVER THE EXPLORATION AND                            EXPLOITATION OF THEIR NATURAL RESOURCES HOWEVER IT IS OUR VIEW THAT A                            GREAT DEAL OF SUCH CONCERN CAN BE ALLEVIATED BY A BETTER UNDERSTANDING                            OF THE NATURE OF OUR REMOTE SENSING EXPERIMENTS INCLUDING OUR DATA                            HANDLING PROCEDURES AND OF POSSIBLE FUTURE SYSTEMS SOME ADVOCATES OF
