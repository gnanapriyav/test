increasing their buildup of                            Russian arms and balking at efforts to resolve the Lebanese crisis                            Ibid D76040603551 If appropriate opportunity arises would appreciate it if Ambassador                            Helms would attempt to draw Shah                        out on specifics of how Iraq is acting as surrogate of Soviets As we see it                        from Baghdad Iraqi regime consists of group of prickly and hardened                        revolutionaries who accept socialist principles but act very much on the                        basis of their own perceptions of Iraqs national interests They are a                        difficult bunch to do business with and we doubt that they change their                        stripes when dealing with the Russians As USG has found out in past role of arms supplier does not in                        itself give supplying country control over policies of receiving state                        particularly in situations where receiving state perceives its own national                        interests to be at stake2 As far as security arrangements for Gulf are concerned there is                        undoubtedly a parallel interest between Iraq and the Soviet Union in that                        both countries for reasons of their own would prefer that Iran not become                        the dominant power in the area In other parts of the Middle East however                        as well as in Iraqs internal politics there is a definite and increasing                        divergence of interests between the two countries Soviet support for the                        Syrian regime Soviet approval of the Cairo summitApparent reference to the Arab League summit held in                            Cairo on October 25 Soviet acquiescence in the Syrian                        intervention in Lebanon and the Soviet call for a resumption of the Geneva                        Conference are all factors adding to the current tension between Baghdad and                        Moscow Iraqi regime has pushed hard for more Soviet support in its bitter                        dispute with the Syrian regime but has little to show for its effortsAccording to telegram 1634 from Baghdad November                            2 Iraq was convinced of the futility of the Arab Leagues diplomatic                            efforts at the Riyadh and Cairo summits in October to resolve the                            Lebanese crisis which granted Syria a mandate to maintain 30000 troops                            in Lebanon to keep the peace and forced PLO fighters out of central                            Lebanon Iraq considered this outcome a capitulation to                            imperialistZionist forces and a first step towards a sell out of Arab                            rights in Palestine National Archives RG 59 Central Foreign Policy Files D7604090529                        We have heard that Iraq was particularly disappointed that USSR did not give Iraq more help in its                        dispute with Syria over the Euphrates River waters3 Believe we should also remember that Baath Party is at least as much Arab                        nationalist as socialist We doubt very much that Iraq would be willing tool                        of Soviets on any issue which they perceive as touching on their Arabism                        Emphasis on Arab nationalism is one principal difference between Baath Party                        and Communist Party of Iraq Baath Party is very jealous of any potential                        rival power center and keeps Iraqi Communist Party under very close                        surveillance Death penalty is imposed on a Baath Party member who also                        joins Iraqi Communist Party4 Baathi regime is almost neurotically sensitive to foreign influence or                        presence and keeps at least as tight a watch on Russians and East Europeans                        in Iraq as they do on Westerners They also have vivid memories of past                        military occupations by Turkey and Great Britain and are particularly                        sensitive to any suggestions of a foreign military presence on their                        sacred soil This sensitivity applies to the Soviets as well as to the                        West5 Last but not least Iraqi economy is now becoming increasingly                        interrelated with Western Europe Japan and the United States Imports of                        goods and transfers of technology from these countries continue to climb as                        Iraqs economic ties with the USSR and Eastern Europe become relatively                        less important With the 1973 increase in oil prices Iraq began earning                        enough foreign exchange to meet its developmental requirements and no longer                        had to depend on economic assistance from the socialist bloc6 We can understand why Shah might see some advantage in attempting to                        convince USG that Iraq is hopeless tool of                        the Soviets but believe we should be careful not to accept this view in                        formulating our own policies On the contrary the growing tension between                        Iraq and the Soviet Union is something that we might be able to exploit to                        our advantage as future developments unfoldThe                            Embassy in Iran responded in telegram 11397 from Tehran November 15                            acknowledging that the Shah was too prone to accept any negative report                            about the Iraqis but pointing out that the fact that the Iraqis had                            repeatedly turned to the Soviet Union for political and economic support                            could not be disputed Ibid D7604250947Wiley	19761106

BoycottAlthough the Arab League had                            maintained an official boycott of Israeli companies and goods since                            1948 Arab countries in recent years had expanded the boycott to include                            US companies that did business with Israel or were owned by American                            Jews1 One of Iraqs most important private sector importers told me on November                        20 that he had observed a definite hardening of GOI position in recent weeks against USIraqi commercial                        relations While last summer he had been encouraged to explore possibilities                        for contracts with US firms and even visited the United States with the                        blessings of the GOI he is now being told                        to hold off on any business arrangements with US companies He attributed                        situation to growing GOI concern over                            USG action with respect to Arab                        boycott2 We have also been advised by another USINT source that Baath National Command is preparing a                        proposal to circulate to other Arab countries through the Iraqi Foreign                        Ministry calling for a boycott by all Arab states of United States goods and                        services if proposed US antiboycott legislation becomes lawCongress was considering legislation to block US                            companies from complying with the Arab boycott by denying them tax                            benefits According to source GOI is considering applying a boycott against USIraqi                        commercial relations but has decided first to sound out the other Arab                        states on the possibility of establishing a unified Arab position3 Decision of Bank of America to stop handling all letters of credit                        containing boycott of Israel language has also jolted Iraqis as Banks                        action came without warning and affected a number of transactions in                        midstream Oil Ministry also resents the

November 19 National Archives RG 59 Central Foreign Policy Files D7604320704                        Iraqis view this as a form of blackmail as USG was not enforcing antiboycott measures when original                        contract for refinery equipment was signed4 GOI officials strongly resent statements                        in US media linking Arab boycott to racism They argue that boycott of                        Israel is not based on antiJewish racism among Arabs any more than US                        boycott of Cuba is based on antiCuban racism among Americans They dismiss                        the relatively few instances of                        documented antiJewish discrimination as mistakes by junior officials which                        have since been corrected and argue that parties hostile to the Arabs have                        seized on these few lapses and used them to misrepresent the essentially                        political thrust of the Arab boycott5 Comment: I believe we have already reached point in                        this boycott affair where our commercial ties with Iraq are being seriously                        jeopardized Iraqis are beginning to have doubts about reliability of US                        as trading partner if USG is as susceptible                        to Zionist pressure groups as it now appears to them to be Iraqis will be                        reluctant to enter into major project commitments or major purchase                        contracts requiring subsequent spare parts or servicing arrangements if                        there is danger that USG acting under                        domestic political pressure will change rules of the game after GOI has made major investments Since Iraq is                        about to launch into major development programs that would involve                        expenditure of 35 billion over next five years freezing out of US                        companies is obviously a matter of serious concern particularly when                        combined with potentially even more serious consequences for our commercial                        ties with Saudi Arabia and other Arab countries6 Much of the emotional heat that has made this subject so difficult for the                        Executive branch to deal with has been caused by the widespread confusion in                        the United States media on the true nature of the boycott There seems to be                        a general assumption in the United States that Arab actions are based on                        racism and that it is therefore immoral for the USG to permit private firms to comply It also seems to be                        widely assumed that selling goods to Israel per se is grounds for                        boycotting an American firm In fact the boycott is more limited in scope                        and is different in its essential purposes than it is generally portrayed                        Its thrust is political and like most political issues the associated                        moral considerations could be endlessly debated What cannot be debated is                        the fact that USG reaction to the boycott                        may do serious damage to the US economy7 While not underestimating the PR problems                        included in broaching this emotional issue to the general public I believe                        that the situation has now reached the point where a well planned public                        educational campaign by the Executive branch is essential to prevent serious                        damage to fundamental US national interests While there are limits to the                        extent to which the State Department can engage in public education                        activities I believe that an effort by the P Bureau to convey to the public                        a somewhat more balanced account of the boycott situation could pay off                        handsomely in limiting the damage to US interests If nothing else such                        an effort would have the effect of focusing debate on the true issues rather                        than on the irrelevancies that have so far marked most of the public                        discussion of this complex

have by now received Baghdad 1749According to telegram 1749 from Baghdad November 28 the Iraqis denied                            complicity in the terrorist attack on the Intercontinental Hotel in                            Amman Jordan but admitted that they gave refuge to Palestinian groups                            and permitted them to carry out training activities in Iraq Ibid                            D7604410008 which is on subject of GOI support for terrorism3 In general I believe USG has very                        limited leverage that could be used unilaterally on GOI and that the costs of using the little that we have would                        be high in terms of US interests On other hand if we could act in                        concert with West Germany Japan and perhaps other NATO allies as well as Saudi Arabia Egypt                        and other Arab countries Iraqis might be forced to modify their support for                        terrorism4 Major pressure point is Iraqi desire for Western technology Most                        important sources are now West Germany and Japan with United States United                        Kingdom and France next in importance Threat to cut off US technology                        alone would carry little weight since almost everything GOI needs can be obtained from other sources                        In fact I believe GOI is already                        considering a sharp reduction in commercial relations with the United States                        in response to USGs antiboycott                            actionsSee Document                                320 The Interests Section reported in telegram 68 from                            Baghdad January 11 1977 that in response to publicity on official                            US antiboycott activity the Iraqi Government was hardening its                            position on the Arab boycott of Israel National Archives RG 59 Central Foreign Policy Files                            D7700100181 Principal result of USG unilateral action would be to freeze US companies out of                        Iraqs 35 billion development program and further reduce the already very                        limited US presence in Iraq On other hand if Iraq were faced with the                        prospect of losing Japanese West German and US technology and possibly                        that of UK and France as well this would be                        a very serious matter for GOI They would                        then be forced to turn once again to Soviet and Eastern European sources for                        their technology which the Iraqis consider to be definitely inferior to                        that they could obtain from the                        West To put these considerations into context in 1975 West German exports                        to Iraq were approximately 1 billion Japan 700 million and UK US and France all in range of 300400                        million Obviously Iraqi market is very important to both West Germany and                        Japan but these governments might react positively to argument that threat                        of terrorism could be reduced without loss of markets if Western nations act                        in concert5 Despite their frequently inconsistent policies I believe that Iraqi                        regime is concerned about its political isolation particularly among other                        Arab and thirdworld countries If other Arab and thirdworld countries were                        to reduce their political contacts with the GOI because of their support for terrorism this too would have                        an impact Even in the case of Western countries Iraqi leadership hungers                        for greater international recognition and would like to be consulted more                        often by Western political leaders It is even possible that consultations                        on terrorism by Western nations would be sufficiently flattering to their                        ego that they would respond by some reduction in their support for terrorist                        activity In this connection it should be noted that official position on                        terrorism is that they are opposed to all terrorist acts except those                        committed within the boundaries of Israel Again the key to this approach                        would be concerted action among Western nations A unilateral approach by                            USG would carry little weight A threat                        to reduce our already limited political contacts would have only marginal                        effect in Baghdad but could have serious impact on our own capability to                        support US commercial interests and to acquire information and                        understanding of what goes on in Iraq6 Another pressure point that might have some weight in Baghdad would be a                        joint approach by a majority of the Arab states including Egypt and Saudi                        Arabia Although they have a strange way of showing it the Iraqi leadership                        is sensitive to its standing among its Arab brothers If we could bring                        about a joint dmarche to the GOI by a                        substantial number of the other Arab states perhaps led by Saudi Arabia and                        Egypt this would have an impact Unfortunately none of the other Arab                        states have demonstrated much backbone on this issue even when they                        themselves are the victims of terrorism7 Believe that reconvening of Geneva Conference will be particularly                        dangerous time as rejectionist elements may then attempt to commit                        atrocities to disrupt conference At that time we might consider organizing                        a coordinated approach to GOI by UN Secretary General the cochairmen of the                        Conference and the participants Although Iraqis are officially opposed to                        Conference they are now taking a pragmatic waitandsee attitude with                        Egyptians who discussed Geneva Conference with Iraqis during VP Mubaraks                        recent visit to Baghdad Iraqi regime might be flattered enough by a                        suitably worded highlevel approach                        in the name of the UN that they would be                        willing to take steps to curb Palestinian extremists now in Iraq8 I would recommend against a unilateral USG protest to GOI Regime                        might look upon such a development as an opportunity to score some                        propaganda points by publishing USG protest                        as evidence of GOI steadfastness in Arab                        and antiimperialist causes9 In dealing with GOI on this issue                        believe it important to keep in mind that Iraqi leadership achieved their                        present eminence through repeated use of terrorist techniques and terrorism                        to them seems a normal part of the political process Approaches based on                        moral or humanitarian considerations would have little impact although                        regime can be pragmatic when they perceive an Iraqi national internal                        interest to be involved In this case best pressure points as noted above                        are regimes desire for Western technology and its concern over Iraqs                        political isolationWiley	19761130

Looking Ahead to                            the Interim Government Negotiations1 If as British hope the date of independence issue can be resolved or                            finessed and this is not certain the conference will then move on to                            discussing the structure and functions of the interim government Some                            African delegates continue to believe that once the independence hurdle                            is overcome the remaining path toward an interim government will be                            relatively smooth This is wishful thinking Future substantive and                            symbolic issues will provide a continuing source of pitfalls which can be skirted only by skillful                            negotiating firm British chairmanship greater flexibility than the                            participants have evidenced to date a more constructive front line                            role and almost certainly increased American involvement2 To the present the conference principals and their immediate advisors                            have focussed their attention almost exclusively on the date of                            independence issue Though no formal positions have emerged on other                            even more thorny topics there has been considerable corridor talk and                            speculation some of which has come to our attention No positions have                            changed radically Nevertheless interesting nuances are appearing as                            simplistic rhetoric is confronted by an exceedingly complex reality3 The Africans original intent to engage in serious negotiations as                            expressed in the opening speeches of the four delegation leaders                            remains firm though Mugabe may                            be having difficulty holding this line within his own delegation Their                            insistence on a true transfer of power to the African majority during                            the interim period and consequently their opposition to continued                            Rhodesian control of the sensitive ministries including Defense Law                            and Order Finance and Information also remain fixed4 The British and Rhodesians appear to be hewing closely to their                            original game plans The British are still intent on reaching an                            agreement as close to Annex C as possible though their original                            insistence on avoiding a substantive role during the interim period is                            wavering The Rhodesians are sticking like adhesive tape to the five                            points and have not developed any wellthoughtout fallback positions                            They prefer to let the British force the nationalists to show their                            cards before revealing their own position further There is also the                            lingering hope among the Rhodesians that the nationalists may fail in                            their attempts to forge a unified position and begin a dissolution                            process which might prove favorable to further independent initiatives                            by the Smith regime5 The obervers have not tried or been able to exercise much control over                            the nationalist delegations As a group they seem to often be operating                            without instructions perhaps at cross purposes and with little                            coordination Some certainly Mogwe and Chona                            stand by their original intention to guide the conference into                            discussions of matters of principles and institutions but in                            confidence have dejectedly admitted that it will be impossible to avoid                            issues of personality and more troubling specifics6 Among the issues which are bubbling to the surface and offer                            significant potential for further fouling the conferences progress are                            the following:A Structure of the interim governmentthe Rhodesians insistence on a                            two tier interim government in strict accordance with point three continues to elicit a negative                            response from the African delegations However no consensus of an                            alternative structure has emerged from the African side As Salim the                            Tanzanian representative told Ivor                                Richard on November 11 the nationalists and observers                            want a one tier government The Africans want a black majority Council                            of Ministers to have all real authority and they see no role for the                            Rhodesia Front There are indications that while the Africans continue                            to oppose the Council of State concept as enunciated by Smith with its                            implicit white veto the idea of a body above the Cabinet to referee                            what will almost surely be fierce blackwhite and blackblack rivalries                            may prove more acceptable as negotiations wear on Chona has privately floated the idea                            that the Council of State could serve as an advisory body to a British                            Governor General The idea has not taken hold but may be resuscitated in                            another form As the British delegations legal advisorThe British delegations legal adviser was                                    Henry Steel                            points out there is precedent for a privy council in colonial                            governments of transitionB British responsibilityintertwined with the issue of the structure of                            the government is the role the British will play in the interim                            government Though the nationalist delegations made clear even before                            the start of the conference their insistence upon Britain resuming its                            colonial responsibilities in Rhodesia it is probable that they had                            little more in mind for the British Governor General than acting as a                            legitimizing and protective authority It is possible that the                            nationalists might be shifting slightly on this issue as their own                            internal differences become manifest Their position is still undefined                            but a growing desire to use the British as a guarantor against Smiths                            usurpation of power mandates at least theoretically a more substantive                            role in the political and security process Nyerere and Kaunda have been in continual contact with Callaghan over the past ten days and                            have urged a larger and more specific role for the British during the                            transitional period including according to Nyereres Nov 10 Martha Honey interview the holding of                            specific portfoliosDefense and External Affairs The utility of a                            meaningful British presence to the nationalists for protection from one                            another is also obviously an important factor more so of course to                                Sithole and Muzorewa than to Nkomo and Mugabe These sentiments are counterbalanced by an                            unspecified uneasiness about possible British recolonization of                            Rhodesia For their part the Rhodesian delegation has made it clear                            that they see no substantive role for Britain during the interim                            government they claim to seek a solution which permits Rhodesiansblack                            and whiteto work out their future in Rhodesia free from foreign                            influence Gaylard said the other                            day that Rhodesian officers would simply not take orders from a British                                appointee whether he is a                            Governor General or an armed forces commander He argued that Rhodesian                            Front members will continue to exercise this power during the interim                            government including the retention of the sensitive security protfolios                            Even making allowance for rhetoric Gaylards analysis reflects the current state of                            Rhodesian thinkingC Military: Beyond their insistence that the crucial security portfolios                            be in black hands and that ZIPA take                            control of the security apparatus during the transitional period there                            has been no further suggestions from the African side as to how this                            might be accomplished The Rhodesians are not even discussing the                            matter Gaylard darkly assumes                            terrorists will be disarmed as they reenter Rhodesia Whether the                            issue of how the respective armed forces will be dealt with formally                            surfaces at the conference or notand in the interest of the                            conferences success it should notthe possibility of internecine                            fighting between the liberation armies obviously weighs heavily upon                            some of the nationalists and observers who are haunted by visions of                            another Angola Despite his political motives Nkomo should be taken seriously when he                            says he is trying to reconstitute ZIPA                            in order to avoid civil war Implausible as it might appear at first                            glance there is a possibility that for reasons of their own each of                            the nationalist leaders might in addition to looking toward Britain for                            assistance in this field also modify their attitude toward the                            Rhodesian army to the point where they might welcome it playing a role                            in keeping the peace One perceptive onlooker here asserts that the                            initial rhetorical vituperation against the Rhodesian military is                            softening Even elements in Mugabes delegation have admitted privately to others                            that order must be maintained by a disciplined security force as the                            period of transition begins At least one ZANU Mugabe                            faction delegation member reports he has less of a problem with white                            security forces than he would have with Smiths black units African                            thoughts on this topic are of course sitll highly illdefined and                            speculative but as the conference progresses more attention will be                            given to how to keep the two black armies and the one white army from                            each others throats during the interim period A precarious balancing                            act of the three with some judicious juggling by the Britishperhaps                            backed by the Commonwealthmay eventually prove to be a solution No                            specific African proposal on how to integrate liberation forces and                            divide security responsibility with the Europeans has surfaced since                                Nkomo mentioned the                            possibility of creating a third security ministryD The franchisedespite Muzorewas early attempt to inject the issue of elections                            into the conference no open discussion of the franchise problem has                            taken place here It appears that even Muzorewa has backed off his original plan at least for                            the present and the other nationalist leaders are more than content to continue ducking the issue                            The Rhodesians have been warned to avoid bringing up the topic in Geneva                            and may indeed not do so There seems to have developed a fairly clear                            consensus that the composition of the electorate is more appropriate                            topic for a constitutional conference organized by the interim                            government This consensus could however crumble if one or more of the                            delegations sense a draft in the structuring of the interim government                            which they view as inimical to their overall strategy and interestsE Cutting the piethere are of course two conferences going on in                            Geneva The more visible one involves the Africans British and                            Rhodesians in an attempt to bring majority rule to Rhodesia The less                            visible but perhaps equally important conference involves the black                            battle for leadership of an independent Zimbabwe The conflicting                            ambitions of the four African leaders is reflected in every tactical                            decision they make Though it would undoubtedly be to the conferences                            benefit to avoid discussion in Geneva of questions of who will assume                            specific powers in the interim government and particularly who will be                            Prime Minister it is clear that the African leaders are not so                            inclined Each of them continues to view himself as Zimbabwes logical                            first Prime Minister and their delegations agree Proposals such as the                            one which would have an apolitical black Rhodesian serve as Prime                            Minister during the interim government fall like lead balloons for the                            moment The Rhodesians seek to avoid making a tough choice by claiming                            that they cannot think of anyone who might fill the billthough they                            wish to split Nkomo and Mugabe the nationalists contend that                            such an individual would not have sufficient authority to lead the                            country during the difficult transitional period One observer                            Botswanan Foreign Minister Mogwe                            suggests that the British could fulfill the function by designating the                            Prime Minister and by dividing the other portfolios equitably among the                            four groups However he offered no hope that the front line states or                            more importantly the nationalists would guarantee to go along with the                            British decision In this issue as in all others the nationalists seem                            to be looking to the British to solve those questions they think are                            impossible to resolveF Rhodesia Front rolewhile the Africans are jockeying amongst                            themselves for position the Rhodesian delegation remains firmly                            committed to propounding its own central role in the interim government                            As Gaylard expressed this                            recently the blacks must realize that the whites not the British                            control power in Rhodesia and that the Rhodesia Front will continue to                            exercise that control during the transitional period and implicitly in                            a measurable way in an independent Zimbabwe This belief in their own                            centrality has no doubt been increased by their military successes in                            Mozambique and what is perceived to be an encouraging shift in Western and in particular South                            African public and governmental opinion toward their favor since the                            conferences inception For their part the Africans remain implacably                            distrustful of Smith and his cohort and can be expected to dig their                            heels in deeply to avoid giving the Rhodesia Front any meaningful power                            during and beyond the transitional period Their position may be best                            reflected in Nyereres November                            10 statement in Dar that the transitional government should be a                            government of national unity a government of consensus of Africans and                            whites who are acceptable to the majority of people    If I were a                            Rhodesian nationalist I would not want a racist to be in my government                            I would not mind including whites in an interim government as long as                            they had all along been against Smith and what Smith stands for7 The above enumerated pitfalls are only a few of several that could                            debilitate the conference Even wider and more fundamental cleavages                            separate the basic outlooks of the white and black delegates One factor                            favorable to the conferences ultimate success however is a real                            appreciation on the part of most of the participants and particularly                            the old line nationalist political leaders that this is their last best                            chance for a negotiated settlement in which their own political                            aspirations might be served Nothing that has happened since the outset                            of the conference has changed that perception8 To date the United States role at the conference has been generally                            low key and suitable to the nature of the discussions which have taken                            place However given the fact that all of the participants for                            disparate reasons view the United States as a critical player in the                            negotiations it is inevitable that pressure will build for more active                            participation on our part Botswanas Archie                                Mogwe noted recently in bemused disappointment that we                            have religiously avoided involvement in the independence date dispute                            Every delegation knows however that we believe the principal purpose                            of the conference is the organization of a government of transition                            Assuming the date of independence problem is solved the conference will                            have overcome two major hurdles and avoided deadlock and breakdown As a                            result the timing and manner of our involvement will have to be                            carefully judged The British including Richard continue to be                            extremely sensitive to any hint we are trying to second guess British                            management We have an invitation to join Richard in planning a                            negotiating strategy to deal with the interim government and we should                            accept Tactical decisions concerning our engagement in the other issues                            of interim government can only be made as the conferences proceedings                            bring problems to the foreAbrams	19761112

                   November 17 Subj: Rhodesia Conference: Geneva Prospects:                            Assessment and RecommendationsSummary:Mugabe and Nkomo remain locked in conference                            trying to decide if they will accept the latest British statementSee Document                                222 The prolonged wrangle over the independence date                            has eroded confidence in the outcome of Geneva and hardened the                            positions of all participants My consultations during the past several                            days have confirmed gloom and uncertainty in all quarters I remain convinced nevertheless that Geneva                            offers the only viable forum for achieving a Rhodesian settlement We                            need to consider acting in London Africa and here if the participants                            are to understand how serious the situation is and how strongly we feel                            a change of style is required End summary1 Before I proceed to Nairobi this evening I am attempting here to give                            an appraisal of Geneva proceedings as gleaned from numerous talks which                            are likely to continue until departure time about midnight I have                            talked with all of the Geneva luminaries except Chissano and Salim and have no reason                            to believe that they would subtract much from the pervasive gloom As my                            reports on these meetings indicate gloom and doom and bleakness prevail                            in Geneva ranging from the vitriol of Mugabe to the soft unreality of Mogwe but including the sternness of                                Chona and the                            otherworldliness of Van der                                Byl and Squires2 The problem: The British have thus far presided over an incredibly                            poor conference but I am no longer certain that the inept performance                            has been entirely of their own making In retrospect one can conceive of                            certain formulations that may have overcome the date problem but it now                            seems probable that no matter what Richard said at the beginning the                            nationalists to a man were determined to pin down a date an act of                            faith and trust as Chona put it                            to me Richard has been the victim of his or someones bad decision to                            allow the date issue to erode confidence and prevent movement of basic                            London decisions of Mozambican intrigue of Nyereres cunning of the lack of front line                            cohesiveness of Nkomos seeming                            impotency and of an unyielding and influential in Geneva at least                                Mugabe Whatever the causes                            Richard is or soon will be at a Geneva impasse He has not panicked but                            is considering inchoate schemes which may only deepen his problems I do                            not think that he will adjourn the conference sine die as he was                            contemplating yesterday but he is likely to return from London                                MondayNovember 22 and seek or                            probably announce a recess for a specific period barring of course an                                NkomoMugabe cavein A recess is far                            better than an adjournment but it is not at all clear what he hopes                            to accomplish during a short recess Still as he assesses alternatives                            he will have no other choice largely because he cannot continue talking                            with the Muzorewa and Sithole factions without arousing                            intolerable suspicions3 Even if the date problem is miraculously overcome the very prolonged                            discussion of this issue has created uncontrollable dynamics and dimmed                            prospects for progress on more substantive matters: the nationalists particularly the                                Mugabe crowd have run wild                            all parties are proceeding as if the Rhodesians were not present in                            Geneva theres an unspoken British assumption that somehow some way                            Washington in the end will handle Salisbury and Pretoria its difficult                            to detect any intention on the part of the nationalists to share power                            even unequally during a transitional government threats of protracted                            armed struggle are rife the observers have become a part of the problem                            rather than a mechanism for seeking solutions and I have the uneasy                            feeling that we are heading for a point when we will be asked to put                            together and sell to Salisbury and Pretoria an Annex D or E or F4 The most reasonably contented contingent in Geneva is the Salisbury                            group Their dire prediction has been buttressed: you cant do business                            with this crowd And already Van der                                Byl and company are pushing hard for their dangerous                                alternativeIn telegram 9210 from                                Geneva November 18 Reinhardt reported on his meeting with the                                Rhodesians Van der Byl                                proposed that Smith should carry out the Kissinger plan on his own and                                organize a government of moderate blacks within Rhodesia and                                sought the support of the United States and Britain to back the                                plan Reinhardt told them                                the plan would meet stiff opposition and urged them to continue                                to consider the problem within the Geneva context and not outside of                                it

SecStateNodis 18Muzorewa is looking better and                            better to them and later as they court respectability perhaps even                                Sithole may be asked to join                            other moderates to carry out the Kissinger plan It wont work of course5 The final element of the problem is the predicted and even projected                                NkomoMugabe split No one doubts that                            eventually perhaps even at the formation of a transitional government                            this split is likely What is not known is whether a separation becomes                            a viable alternative or simply another layer of the problem for there                            is still a prevailing attitude among Mugabes more extreme subordinates that the new Zimbabwe                            should rise phoenix like from the ashes of Rhodesia to which they set                            fire Nyereres gyrations help                            propel along those who wish to travel this bloody trail6 Date war results I want to repeat: the casualties of the prolonged                            wrangle over the date of independence are numerous and the divisions                            which have emerged will make the next phase of the conference if there                            is one more difficult to negotiate7 To the extent that there was ever external support for the conference                            it has diminished On the Africawide scene the fragile consensus among                            the front line Presidents and their observers in Geneva has been at                            least temporarily broken and may not reappear except on the basis of more extreme demands The                            Mozambicans first followed by the Tanzanians have played separate                            hands seemingly never reviewing the bidding and have forced their                            colleagues to follow suit Nigeria in the person of a clever diplomat                            operating under Commonwealth coverPresumably a reference to Eleazar Chukwuemeka Anyaoku Assistant                                Secretary General for the Commonwealth Secretariat is now a                            fullfledged observer of conference business and its unhelpful                            influence has already been felt Chona as I saw yesterday and as the British confirm in                            detail has begun to play his own game with little effective discipline                            being exercised by Kaunda                            Persuaded of ZIPAs importance the                            observers have embraced the more extreme Mugabespouted militant demands Undercut by unilateral                            Mozambican and Tanzanian moves a moderate like Mogwe feels and is powerless8 Equally on the external front it seems to us from this distance that                            the South African public support for Geneva may have slipped The South                            African press over the past two weeks has regularly highlighted black                            intransigence and the shift in South African opinion must limit                                Vorsters ability to obtain                            concessions from Smith9 The British have been bruised and burned by their experience as                            conference host and chairman They seem to be more convinced than ever                            that Geneva under present rules will not produce a settlement and that                            Britain will be mired in a long costly and probably inconclusive                            process The nationalists decision to press Britain at the outset for a                            clear indication of Britains responsibilities has reinforced British                            fears The experience of the independence date debate may have taught                            the more faint hearted among the British that their interests are served                            by settling to the strongest bidder Nationalists pressures have forced                            the British to believe that the only way out is through significant                            concessions to African positions For the moment they too have all but                            forgotten that Smith is an actor on the Geneva stage and seem to believe                            that we can produce Smith and the South Africans on call They vow that                            they will die at the altar of Annex C but they have not convinced me                            nor Wisner all along that their                            heart is in the fight Finally we must remember that since the Pearce                            Commission the British have been blacker than the blacks and there                            will be no rush to assume prePearce stances10 The nationalists position has also deteriorated during the debate                            The wild men have almost succeeded in deadlocking the conference They                            know their power They are aware that intransigence over time will                            result in substantial front line and other African support Nkomos alliance with Mugabe has become a clear impediment to                            progress As he seeks to build his political position in Rhodesia and                                avert civil war Nkomo has been regularly outmaneuvered                            by his more radical colleagues Muzorewa has reacted with increasing alarm to the                            Patriotic Fronts maneuvers The chancy understanding which seemed to be                            developing among the nationalists at the beginning of the conference has                            eroded and growing public exchanges between Muzorewa and the Patriotic Front portend ill for the                            future11 Smith could well conclude that he has emerged the victor in this                            round His new confidence may mean that he will be more difficult to                            deal with if negotiations over the interim government commence Through                            his restraint in the face of African provocation Smith probably feels                            that he has won points with Western and South African opinion His                            reported military successes should also serve to increase his                            confidence The debate over the independence date has pitted Britain                            against the nationalists and Smith may conclude that his leverage with                            the British is greater than at any time in the past Van der Byls November 18 dmarche to

             may not bother Smith as much as most Africans think He cares far more                            about the power he will exercise in an interim government In fact the                            earlier the date of independence the more authority he will expect                            during the transition Thus Smith may have concluded that British                            concessions on the date have played right into his hands12 Recommendations: First I cannot emphasize too                            much that even if the date issue is resolved the future course of the                            conference is likely to be rocky Any resolution of this issue will at                            somepoint be accompanied by or accelerate an NkomoMugabe                            split The consequence for the conference and Zimbabwe over the long run                            will be severe The following are in my judgment minimum USG requirements some of which resemble                            biting bullets without teeth:A Until and unless we conclude that our objectives are unobtainable the                            Geneva conference must be preserved When the British speak of                            adjourning and repackaging to use a Dennis Grennan phrase they have no plan in                            mind and some British may really mean abandoning and cutting losses It                            will not be possible in the foreseeable future to put together a new                            conference if Geneva dissolves Neither we nor the British will be able                            to convince Machel Nyerere or the radicals to reconvene on                            terms of moderation Smith and the South Africans will be hard to hook                            againB Still we need the British whatever the leverage we must expend in                            holding them in a rigorous position While the nationalists and the front line are now pressing and                            occasionally vilifying the British the UK represents their only fallback instrument in a                            transitional government After more emotion is spent in Geneva the only                            arbiter during transition is likely to be the UKC Sweet reasonableness no longer seems to be the appropriate message for                                Nyerere or even Kaunda Further talk about irreversible                            courses and the avoidance of violence will only result in messages                            similar to the one from Ibadan I think that you should write to each                            and in a rather tough tone to Nyerere point out that he seems to have abandoned the                            consultative process begun last April with the resultant near collapse                            of Geneva at least you would have expected him to be in touch before                            taking actions which were predictably unhelpful Soften the tone with                                Kaunda but leave no doubt                            that he is playing with fire the fire of civil war that may engulf him                            as well as Rhodesia Neither man should be left to doubt that we are                            unhappy disappointed but still willing to work with them if we                                canSee Document                                    228 Each should know that compromise is a word                            that should enter their vocabulary of negotiation They must understand                            that intransigence plays into Smiths hands and sharply reduces our                            ability directly or through Pretoria to apply pressureD While Geneva is not the best place to make an appraisal I have tried                            to point out indications of shifts in South African opinion If we have                            not we should take early steps to measure what Geneva has done to                                Vorster We know and have                            stated what it has

tough message to the nationalists                            especially Nkomo and Muzorewa that we cannot produce                            Salisbury if they remain intransigent We have some sense of what sort                            of interim government they want but we see no indication that they make                            any distinction between power sharing and power grabbingF We

British on Rhodesia                            Conference1 Rhodesia conference chairman Ivor                                Richard is in London this weekend and will be consulting                            with Foreign Secretary Crosland                                FCO colleagues and possibly Prime                            Minister Callaghan on Monday                            November 22 prior to returning to Geneva for meeting with Patriotic                            Front that evening While his consultation is being described as a                            routine fortnightly report it is clear that conference is at impasse                            over issue of independence date and cannot proceed to other issues until                            this one is disposed of to the satisfaction of both the British acting                            through the chairman and the Patriotic Front Divisions within the                            Front between Nkomo and Mugabe are very great but there is                            danger that an effort either to split the two or to carry on                            negotiations with the other delegations without the Front would risk                            complete rejection of the process by the important frontline                            presidents2 In the gloomy atmosphere of Geneva it appeared at one point that some                            of the British advisors considered the possibility of adjourning the                            conference either indefinitely or for a short period although the                            latest indication is that the British may be inclined to send Richard back with instructions                            to soldier on with the independence date issue a while longer3 The British probably have no clear plan for solving the current issue                            or dealing with the situation that will result if it cannot be solved                            While we wish to keep abreast of their thinking and share with them our                            own thoughts and concerns we do not want them to feel we are pressing                            them to adopt a particular position on the independence date which is                            an issue affecting the British role and British political sensitivities                            Nonetheless in view of the obvious problem at hand we believe it                            important to express our concerns and explore certain questions with                            them at this time4 Accordingly you are instructed to get in touch with Crosland Rowlands or Palliser in the FCO and                            say you have been asked to seek an appointment if possible to consult                            jointly with them and Mr Richard to exchange views on the conference                            and any steps we should be taking to keep the negotiating process going                            In so doing you should use the following talking pointsAWe admire the skill and patience with which the chairman has handled                            the troublesome issue of an independence dateBIt has been our hope that this issue could be bypassed so that the                            conference could move on to the business of arranging a transitional                            government which would provide the mechanism by which the transfer of                            power establishment of majority rule and independence would be made                            effectiveCThe approach which the nationalists particularly the Patriotic Front                            have taken on the independence date illustrates the problem of taking                            one issue at a time and being forced to settle each point before moving                            on If the procedure continues to be followed further blowups will be                            inevitableDIf it is possible we believe the best strategy is to keep all issues                            open until nearer the end of the conference when the time comes to put                            a final package together That way one maintains opportunities for                            negotiating tradeoffs between different positions on different                            issuesEHow can we convey the wisdom of this negotiating approach to the                            delegations in GenevaFWe note that the Patriotic Front has mentioned elections in their                            latest statement about an independence date This raises the danger of                            the nationalists opening up another extraneous debate on a single issue                            before getting to the substance of a transitional government since the                            organization of elections including the franchise is one of the                            important and difficult questions that the transitional government is to                            deal with We hope the nationalists will not insist on discussing these                            constitutional questions before agreeing on a transitional government                            or there will never be a transitionGWe are concerned as we know you must be that the present impasse does                            not force a breakup or even adjournment of the Geneva conferenceHWe believe that adjournment would run the risk of handing initiative                            over to the more radical front line leaders who will encourage return to                            the conference table if at all only after they have worked out a                            package of nearly unconditional surrender terms that neither Smith could                            accept nor the South Africans support And without some hope of the                            latter two elements negotiations become impossible and escalating                            warfare inevitableIIn order to keep the conference going we wonder if we should seek to                            point out to key front line presidents that adjournment over the                            independence date issue will be more damaging to the African cause than                            to Smith In this connection we are prepared to send Ambassador                                Reinhardt to see Nyerere and Kaunda again although Nyerere and through him Machel may be the most difficult and important to                            convinceJShould we not perhaps reiterate that Smith accepted Callaghans outside time of two years                            and so did the front line presidents Within that framework Smith has                            already accepted the goal of majority rule leaving for negotiation only                            the question of how and exactly when within the time he accepted this                            was to be accomplishedKAdjournment over the issue of an independence date strikes us as                            potentially more damaging than over substantive issues involved in                            reaching agreement on a transitional governmentLWe believe that none of the delegation leaders who are currently                            negotiating in Geneva will have an opportunity to play a role in future                            Zimbabwean government if the present conference breaks up or adjourns

Crosland November 22 because of                            conflicting schedules Minister and Embassy officer therefore called                            on Ted Rowlands who was joined by Ivor                                Richard and Philip Mansfield The three had just emerged                            from a long session on Rhodesia with the Foreign Secretary2 We made the points in our instructions emphasizing the dangers we                            foresee in an adjournment of the conference and saying that Reinhardt is prepared to see Kaunda and Nyerere again We also stressed the concern that if the                            obstacle of the independence date can be surmounted the conference                            should proceed to negotiate a package for the transition and that the                            package should keep distinct those functions which are the                            responsibility of Geneva from those which are the responsibility of the                            interim government3 Richard took the lead in responding He said there were two immediate                            considerations affecting the British stance on the independence date                            issue First Parliament would simply not accept a formula for Rhodesian                            independence which did not provide for elections Second if Britain is                            to follow the pattern of previous decolonization processes as the front                            line presidents are insistingthen the procedure Britain is now                            following is the traditionally proper course We asked if the British                            had considered getting off the independence date issue by instead                            setting a firm date for elections Rowlands said they had just discussed this possibility                            with Crosland and that Richard                            would be prepared to put forward that idea in Geneva at the right time                            if necessary4 Richard then described the political considerations which seem to                            dominate British thinking on the date question The issue itself he                            said is getting less important than the struggle now going on within                            the Patriotic Front A crunch between Mugabe and Nkomo                            was bound to come sooner or later and sooner is probably better It is                            important that Nkomo win this                            unfolding showdown with Mugabe                            Richard said Although it is difficult to get a good feel for this war                            of nerves the British have                            received signals that their firmness on the issue is helping Nkomo assert his authority within the                            Front If Nkomo gives the private                            impression that he wants the British to remain firm they will if                            relaxing the British stand will benefit Nkomo Richard is ready to go more in the direction of a                            definite date perhaps using a formula which calls for elections by                            January 1 1978 leading to independence by March 1 In any event the                            British are prepared to play the independence date issue flexibly in                            whatever manner is most advantageous for Nkomo visvis Mugabe5 Richard said that he expects to tie up the date question within the                            next day or two If he fails to do so the British will call for a short                            adjournment of perhaps ten or fourteen days Asked if adjournment would                            not in fact work against Nkomo                            rather than for him Richard answered somewhat vaguely that Nkomo would use the adjournment to                            organize people who would then put pressure on Mugabe Rowlands added that if the conference is bogged down on                            the date issue a temporary adjournment would be the only way to break                            the impasse He then said that if the issue is resolved by specifying a                            date for elections the US might have to put pressure on Smith to accept                            the agreement or at least note it and move on to other points6 Richard and Rowlands reacted                            positively to a Reinhardt                            mission to Lusaka and Dar es Salaam Both agreed that some gentle                            disapproval expressed by the US to Kaunda and Nyerere would do no harm Richard said he had no good                            explanation for Nyereres                            aboutface on the independence date other than the unhelpful influence                            of the Nigerians7 Richard said he fully intended to proceed with the remainder of the                            conference on a package basis He plans to solicit ideas from each                            delegation on the whole structure of an interim government Nkomo he understands is already                            working on detailed proposals When all plans have been put to the                            British Richard will then devote one day to discussions with each of                            the delegations followed by a plenary session to discuss the basic                            issues Ultimately he said when all views have been aired he will                            table something similar to Annex C8 Rowlands said the UK is entirely conscious of keeping                            separate those issues which ought to be taken up in Geneva and those                            which should be left to the interim government He nevertheless fears                            that any discussion of elections even in the context of setting a date                            of independence could lead to a discussion of franchise It will be                            difficult to prevent the nationalists from introducing oneman onevote                            as a definition of elections he said The British will insist however                            that franchise falls within the purview of the interim government9 Comment: Richard is going back to Geneva with                            his confidence intact and with the immediate tactical goal of playing                            his cards in whatever manner                            most supports Joshua Nkomo He                            assumes we agree and that we will take what steps we can to strengthen                                Nkomos position If the date                            issue cannot be resolved however the British have already decided on                            adjournment as the next best moveArmstrong	19761122

London for                                Seitz Subj: Rhodesia                            Conference: Results of Richards Consultations in London1 I called on Richard this afternoon to find out what happened in London                            and what decisions were reached Richard was accompanied by Robin Byatt                            and Robin Young He said that his guidelines from London called for him                            to finish out this week of consultations with the various delegations in                            order to clarify as much as possible their views and positions Richard will also try to test                            Smiths willingness to accept a new framework which would allow him to                            stay in the game This will allow London time to draw up a range of                            options with regard to British responsibilities in the interim                            government which will then be presented to the Secretary and Callaghan this weekend Richard will be                            present for the talks in London2 If the Secretary and Callaghan                            conclude that the conference cannot be held together during the next                            week while the parties including the front line presidents and South                            Africa are sold on a new package of British responsibilities then                            Richard would return to Geneva next week and adjourn the conference for                            the Christmas period During that time we and the British would try to                            sell a new package based on expanded British involvement in Africa and                            then would try to reconvene the conference We understand separately                            that the package of options on British responsibilities being prepared                            in Whitehall will be sent info to Washington3 Richard told me in strictest confidence and asked that we hold the                            information closely that Crosland believes the mandate he has received from the                            Cabinet is broad enough to develop whatever degree of British                            responsibility may be necessary and he would not need to return to the                            Cabinet for a decision Military involvement is of course not in the                            mandate4 Richard does not think he can carry the conference through next week                            without a new negotiating framework The nationalists he said are                            predisposed to a recess particularly Nkomo and Muzorewa who would like to adjourn this week Both want                            to campaign at home The British understand that it will not be easy to                            put Geneva back together following a recess They recognize that                            nationalist demands may escalate and positions harden but British do not                            see that they have many choices5 Immediate prospects depend on Smiths attitude which Richard will                            begin to probe this evening in a quiet private session I urged Richard                            to find any way possible to convince Smith that the UK is sympathetic to his problems and to                            overcome some of the suspicion verging on hostility that has developed                            between Smiths delegation and the British Richard said he would                            consider the suggestion but stressed that if Smith insisted on                            continuing his public attacks on the British he could not expect any                            improvement in the treatment he receives in return Neither we nor the                            British have any indication of Smiths plans and even his own delegation                            is very much in the dark At present the only indication we have is                            what the press is carrying which contains both positive and negative                            signals While reiterating that he regards the five points as a firm                            contract Smith indicated some possible flexibility by saying upon                            departing Salisbury that we have to keep ourselves in a position where we can move                            and play things off the cuff6 Richard said that if Smith sticks to his socalled contract the                            conference will be in dire peril and even a new package would not make                            any new difference He reiterated what he had said to Assistant                            Secretary Reinhardt that Annex                            C for all intents and purposes is dead He would be reluctant to                            propose to Crosland that the                            British try to table a package of UK                            responsibilities until they have had a chance to get some indication                            from the Africans and South Africans that such a package might be                            acceptable7 When I asked Richard about the current mood in London concerning the                            talks he replied that in general the attitude was good principally                            because the British had finally become comfortable with the idea that it                            would take a more active British role if a settlement is to be achieved                            He noted that many had not expected the conference to get as far as it                            has Not only has the conference held together but the parties have                            spelled out their positions in clear detail and we now have a better                            assessment of where the gaps lie and what will be necessary to bridge                            them The gaps remain wide and it is clear that the nature of UK involvement will have to be much                            greater to include voting participation in a body like the Council of                            State and perhaps a tie breaking role in the Council of Ministers as                            well Some UK involvement in the                            security aspects would also have to be contemplated But he believes the                            British by and large are better prepared to accept such responsibilities                            now than at any time since the negotiations beganCatto	19761118

   DCA in September at the request                                of the Ford administration in                                order to show Turkey that the process to restore bilateral relations                                had begun No action was taken on the resolution prior to                                adjournment Congress and the Nation                                19731976 Vol IV p 888 may turn out to have more                            significant consequences than as yet sensed either by the Congress or by                            many Turks2 If the Congress had endorsed the DCA                            before adjournment the Turkish Parliament would almost certainly have                            soon followed suit thereby again placing the presently threatened                            USTurk military partnership on a stable foundation Some months from                            now we may find ourselves looking back on last summer as a lost                            opportunity which may not come back to us again This is not inevitable                            matters may not take such an unfortunate turn But it is a sufficiently                            real possibility as to require that we take clear note of it at this                            timeand make a major effort to avoid it3 A key to the problem is timing Even if the next Congress endorses the                                DCA the effort to restore our                            relationships here can still fail It can fail because of the                            congressional actions not coming soon enough to avoid the preelection                            campaign which we will soon be headed into here in Turkey4 The Turkish general elections have to be held not later than next                            October and they may come as early as this coming spring As in the                            United States the Turkish political campaigns begin many months before                            election day and once this period is under way the Parliaments                            tendency is to put off controversial legislative actions until after the                            election Acting at least in part on this same principle the Congress                            has delayed action on the DCA until                            midwinter at the earliest5 Even if President Ford had been                            reelected it would appear from our vantage point here that it would at                            best have been problematic as to whether completion of congressional                            action on the DCA could have been                            achieved by a midwinter time period With the arrival of a new                            administration it would appear that this would be even more                            problematic Presumably any new administration would wish to reexamine                            the DCA before deciding the stance it                            would take respecting it After weighing current circumstancesand our                            basic interestsin the Eastern Mediterranean however I would very much                            hope that the new administration will decide to endorse this agreement                            as it is presently written and seek early congressional approval But                            even if it should decide to do this there is still the danger that in                            competition with the many other problems the new administration must                            face this decision will be delayed to a point where midwinter                            congressional action becomes an impossibility6 An additional factor is the timing of USGGOG agreement on a new                            USGreek DCASee Document 64 and footnote                                    3 thereto It is possible that the conclusion of                            this agreement may be delayed until some time after the new                            administration takes office If as we assume the new administration                            will wish if it is  at all                            possible to go to the Congress with both agreements at the same time                            this could cause further delay in seeking congressional action on the                            USTurkish DCA7 While deadline predictions are especially risky it would appear to me                            now that if the Congress has not completed action on the DCA by midMarch it will then be too late                            for the Turkish Parliament to act on it prior to their own election                            campaigns If I am correct in my assumption that the elections will be                            next fall rather than next spring this means that Turkish parliamentary                            action will be delayed for the better part of an additional year                            Moreover it is likely to mean that the agreement itself will become an                            important and controversial issue in the campaign For the longer the                            Congress delays action on the DCA the                            more likely it is that the political opposition to the Demirel                            government DCA andor that the Demirel                            government itself may collapse or be defeated thus leaving the DCA with no sponsor All this in turn means                            that by November 8 In addition the longer we delay in putting back on a solid basis the                            USTurk relationship the longer we add to the risk of serious                            GreekTurk confrontationsconfrontations which could eventually be of a                            character to threaten prospects for restoring military partnerships with                            either Turkey or Greece9 We have considered what the situation would be here if Congress did                            not complete action on the DCA before the Turkish political campaign                            started but did give its endorsement sometime after the campaign was                            underway This would perhaps have a marginally beneficial effect in                            reducing the political contentiousness of this issue in the campaign                            but only a marginal one It would also give us the opportunity to argue                            that all the shut down installations should immediately be reopened                            Turk negotiators in Washington last March said that these installations                            would be reopened immediately after favorable congressional action but                            that was before the GOT decided that the                            agreement also had to be put through its own Parliament Unfortunately                            however I believe that the GOT could not agree to do this prior to its                            own Parliament having acted particularly in the midst of a hardfought                            political campaign10 Possibly the consequences of delayed congressional action could turn                            out to be less serious than the foregoing suggests If Congress should                            continue to vote significant military assistance levels to  Turkey in the interim both                            governments could end up muddling through an extended additional period                            of uncertainty It is also possible although I think unlikely that in                            the intervening period international andor Turkish domestic                            developments would not rule out congressional and parliamentary approval                            roughly 13 to 15 months from now To count on this however is a                            highrisk course indeed11 It is also possible that having found that we can get through one                            additional year or somewhat more without an agreement but with                            continuing military assistance appropriations we could then continue                            to get along in the years thereafter still without either side having                            acted formally on the DCA Again this would be a highrisk course but                            it is a possibility that cannot be ruled out altogether Should we end                            up following this latter route we would have to insist on the opening                            of most of our closed down installations We might not need to insist on                            all being reopened but certainly most of them must be allowed to                            function if the flow of our assistance is to continue Even if our                            relationship could limp along in this way however it would be                            seriously plagued by the absence of all the key administrative and other                            vital arrangments which have been so carefully battled over in the                                DCA Eventually we would have to                            work out formally or informally substitute arrangements which are not                            likely to be as desirable or workable as those embodied in the present                                DCA12 Another course that the new administration may examine is the                            negotiating of a new DCA or at least                            the entering into of new negotiations designed to amend the present                                DCAwhile insuring that at least the                            present level of military assistance continues to flow while this                            process is under way The serious danger here however is that such an                            action would continue to invite all the basic risks of delay noted                            earlier It also risks our ending up with either no agreement or an                            agreement less advantageous to us than the present one13 Still another approach would be to adopt the position of a number of                            congressional critics ie that the DCA should be pressed with the Congress only when there is                            substantial progress in the Cyprus situation Any public attempt to use                            this kind of open leverage on the Turks will be as unwise and                            unsuccessful in the future as it has been in the past It will not                            produce progress on Cyprus It will only hasten the deterioration of the                            USTurk security partnership On the other hand the Turks have an even                            greater security stake in restoring the USTurk partnership than does                            the US If they can without a display of public duress be pushed into                            a more flexible and constructive stance on the Cyprus problem this                            could help immeasurably with the Congress and thus help also Turkeys                            own security position For the basic reasons repeatedly spelled out in                            the Embassys earlier reporting this will not be easy to accomplish In                            a separate message however we will  be commenting on how a new effort in this regard might                            most effectively be mountedNot                                found14 Regardless of whether such an effort can succeed however the basic                            point of this message remains: namely that failure to get early                            congressional endorsement of the new DCA                            risks the continued deterioration and disintegration of the USTurk                            security partnership Given the importance of this partnership to the                            world strategic balance and to US security interests it therefore seems                            to me that it is essential that the present administration make a major                            effort to convince the new administration of the need to move the DCA through the Congress in the early weeks                            of the next congressional session15 Otherwise we may find that inadvertently but quite possibly                            irrevocably we have lost a military partnership which in our own                            security interest we simply cannot afford to lose This is not to                            suggest that if the partnership does disintegrate the Turks will switch                            sides in the Cold War Initially they will probably not leave NATO What will take place however                            along with a probable increase in GreekTurkish tensions is 1 a                            disintegration of strength on the eastern flank of NATO 2 the creation of a power vacuum                            in this area with all the obvious dangers this entails and 3 a                            serious diminution of the US presence in the Eastern Mediterranean                            along with all that this in turn entails not only for our NATO                            interests but also for our interests with respect to Israel and the                            rest of the Middle EastMacomber	19761108

ROLE AND THAT DISPOSITION OF INTELLIGENCE GAINED                            WAS A JAPANESE PREROGATIVE IT WAS ALSO REASON WHY GOJ HAS INSISTED ON REIMBURSING US FOR                            TRANSPORTATION AND EXPLOITATION COSTS AND WHY GOJ HAS BEEN SO ULTRASENSITIVE ABOUT OFFICIAL STATEMENTS                            ON MIG EVALUATION EMANATING FROM US SIDE EVEN WHILE MUCH INFORMATION

             CONSISTING OF DEVELOPMENT AID PL 480                            LOANS AND SOME EXIM BANK CREDITS SINCE OUR DEVELOPMENT AID PLUS                                PL 480 IS PROJECTED TO RUN CLOSE                            TO 80 MILLION PER YEAR THIS LEAVES ONLY 1015 MILLION PER YEAR FOR                            EXIM CREDITS IN PRACTICE OVER THE PAST FIVE YEARS OUR EXIM LOANS PLUS                            GUARANTEES TO THE PHILIPPINES HAVE AVERAGED MORE THAN 200 MILLION PER                            YEAR IN ADDITION TO THESE CATEGORIES WE COULD TOSS IN OTHER CREDITS                            SUCH AS CCC LOANS WHICH THIS YEAR ALONE AMOUNT TO 62 MILLION IN SHORT                            WE CAN CONSTRUCT AN ECONOMIC PACKAGE USING ONLY THOSE ITEMS ALREADY                            SCHEDULED WHICH COULD BE DESCRIBED AS WELL OVER 1 BILLION OVER THE                            NEXT FIVE YEARS4 PROCEEDING THEREFORE FROM THE FACT THAT THE ECONOMIC PACKAGE AS                            CURRENTLY DESCRIBED IS LARGELY COSMETIC WE MUST RECOGNIZE THAT THE                            ONLY REALLY CRITICAL MONETARY ELEMENT IN OUR NEGOTIATIONS IS THE                            MILITARY AID AND THAT ITS GRAVAMEN IS THE GRANT MILITARY ASSISTANCE WE                            HAVE DESCRIBED THAT AS POTENTIALLY 40 MILLION PER YEAR IN OUR OFFER                            ALTHOUGH WE HAVE PRESIDENTIAL AUTHORITY TO GO OUT TO 50 MILLION AND                            THAT IS PROBABLY WHERE THE FILIPINOS WOULD BE PREPARED TO SETTLE                            ASSUMING THIS SUM WERE MATCHED BY AN EQUAL AMOUNT OF FMS CREDIT ANDOR GUARANTEED LOANS WE COULD                            HAVE A MILITARY PACKAGE OF 500 MILLION OVER FIVE YEARS ADDING THIS TO                            THE ECONOMIC PACKAGE WE COULD DESCRIBE A TOTAL OF NEARLY 20 BILLION                            OVER FIVE YEARS OUR POSITION AND THE PHILIPPINE POSITION WITH THE                            WEIGHT CLEARLY IN THEIR FAVOR5 SIMILARLY IN DEALING WITH THE MUTUAL DEFENSE ASPECTS OF THE                            AIDEMEMOIRE WE CAN ACCEPT THEIR POSITION WITH SEMANTIC BUT                            SUBSTANTIAL ADJUSTMENTS METROPOLITAN TERRITORY FOR EXAMPLE CAN BE                            DESCRIBED AS THE LAND AREAS WITHIN THE AREA DELINEATED IN THE TREATY                            OF PARIS AS AMENDED BY THE USUK TREATY OF                            2 JANUARY 1930 THIS WOULD AVOID A NUMBER OF COMPLEX ISSUES WHICH THE                            FILIPINOS KNOW WE WILL NOT ACCEPT WE CAN ALSO ASSURE THEM THAT THE                            SOUTH CHINA SEA IS IN THE PACIFIC AREA AS FAR AS AUTOMATICITY IS                            CONCERNED WE CAN REAFFIRM THE LANGUAGE USED BY DULLES EISENHOWER AND                                JOHNSON BUT MAKE                            CLEAR THAT IT DOES NOT RPT NOT CARRY AS                            BROAD A COMMITMENT AS DESCRIBED IN THE AIDEMEMOIRE WITTINGLY OR                            UNWITTINGLY THE FILIPINOS HAVE MISCONSTRUED THE LANGUAGE OF THE WAR                            POWERS ACT BUT AGAIN IT CAN BE CITED VERBATIM FOR WHATEVER SOLACE IT                            MAY GIVE THEM6 IN SHORT EXCEPT FOR THE ABSURDLY HIGH GRANT AID COMPONENT ON MILITARY                            AID THE FILIPINO AIDEMEMOIRE IS RATHER SHREWDLY DESIGNED TO PERMIT A                            CONSTRUCTIVE RENEWAL OF NEGOTIATIONS WHENEVER THE CARTER ADMINISTRATION                            DECIDES TO TAKE THIS INITIATIVE I BELIEVE THE FILIPINOS WILL GIVE US                            FEW MONTHS GRACE AT LEAST SO LONG AS OUR CURRENT MILITARY ASSISTANCE                            PROGRAM CONTINUES TO FUNCTION BUT ASSUME THAT THEY WILL BEGIN TO                            DEMONSTRATE SOME MEASURE OF IMPATIENCE AS THE SPRING OF 1977 WEARS                            ON7 FROM OUR POINT OF VIEW THE ISSUE WHICH HAS TO BE DECIDED IS WHETHER                            THE NEW ADMINISTRATION SHOULD JUST PICK UP THE NEGOTIATIONS WHERE THEY                            LEFT OFF OR WHETHER IT SHOULD INTRODUCE A NEW ELEMENT I STRONGLY                            RECOMMEND THAT WE REEXAMINE A VERY CENTRAL ASPECT OF OUR APPROACHTHE                            PROPOSAL TO PROVIDE GRANT MILITARY ASSISTANCE ON AN ANNUAL BASIS MY                            REASONS FOR THIS RECOMMENDATION ARE PROVIDED IN THE FOLLOWING                            PARAGRAPHS8 AS DEPARTMENT IS AWARE PHILIPPINE AUTHORITIES LED BY DEFENSE                            SECRETARY ENRILE                            HAVE PRESSED HARD FOR AN ARRANGEMENT UNDER WHICH WE WOULD PAY RENTAL IN                            THE FORM OF AN ANNUAL CASH GRANT FOR THE USE OF OUR MILITARY BASES                            HERE ON OF THEIR EXPRESSED REASONS FOR THIS PROPOSAL IS THEIR DESIRE TO                            TERMINATE THE CURRENT MUTUAL DEFENSE ASSISTANCE AGREEMENT AND THE MAP SYSTEM OF PROCURING MILITARY EQUIPMENT                            FROM THE UNITED STATES THE GOP WOULD                            PROPOSE INSTEAD TO ESTABLISH A MILITARY PURCHASING MISSION IN THE                            UNITED STATES USING THE ANNUAL CASH GRANT TO FINANCE ACQUISITION OF                            MILITARY MATERIAL9 BECAUSE OF THIS PREFERENCE THE GOP HAS                            BEEN LESS THAN ENTHUSIASTIC ABOUT US PROPOSALS TO INSERT AN ARTICLE IN                            THE MILITARY BASES AGREEMENT BEING NEGOTIATED TO PROVIDE FOR A                            TURKISHTYPE MILITARY ASSISTANCE PROGRAM PREMISED UPON STRICT                            OBSERVANCE OF ALL MAP REGULATIONS AND                            PROCEDURES IN A SENSE THE GOP FEELS IT                            WOULD BE DOING US A FAVOR TO ACCEPT THIS SORT OF ARRANGEMENT RATHER THAN                            THE RENTAL ARRANGEMENT THEY PROPOSE10 AT THE SAME TIME IT IS CLEAR FROM THE RESULTS OF THE RECENT US                            ELECTIONS AND THE EXPRESSED SENTIMENT OF THE US CONGRESS THAT MILITARY                            ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS FOR WHATEVER PURPOSE WILL MEET WITH LESS FAVOR                            THAN THEY HAVE IN THE PAST MOREOVER GIVEN THE NATURE OF THE PHILIPPINE                            GOVERNMENT AND THE TENOR OF THE HUMAN RIGHTS PROVISIONS IN THE LATEST                            FOREIGN ASSISTANCE ACT IT IS EQUALLY CLEAR THAN AN ANNUAL APPROPRIATION                            FOR MILITARY ASSISTANCE FOR THE PHILIPPINES UNDER A MULTIYEAR                            ASSISTANCE AGREEMENT WOULD BE A PAINFUL ORDEAL THAT WOULD BRUISE OUR                            BILATERAL RELATIONS INORDINATELY11 IN VIEW OF ALL THESE CONSIDERATIONS I INFORMALLY SUGGESTED TO SENIOR                            OFFICIALS OF STATE AND DEFENSE DURING MY CONSULTATIONS IN EARLY                            OCTOBER THAT US NEGOTIATORS OUGHT TO EXAMINE THE PROSPECTS FOR QUID                            TO COVER OUR MILITARY BASES IN SOME DENOMINATION OTHER THAN MILITARY                            EQUIPMENT I POINTED OUT THAT THE PHILIPPINES IN ORDER TO ESTABLISH                            SOME MEASURE OF SELFRELIANCE AND INDEPENDENCE FROM OPEC OIL NEEDS TO SPEND CONSIDERABLE                            CAPITAL SUMS ON ITS DEVELOPMENT OF ENERGY RESOURCES ITS POTENTIAL FOR                            EXAMPLE IN GEOTHERMAL POWER IS SIGNIFICANT AND IT CAN USEFULLY EMPLOY                            ALMOST ANY ANNUAL SUM WE WOULD BE PREPARED TO CONSIDER IN GEOTHERMAL                            POWER DEVELOPMENT OVER THE NEXT TEN YEARS12 I HAVE THEREFORE PROPOSED THAT INSTEAD OF A MULTIYEAR MILITARY                            ASSISTANCE PROGRAM COMPOSED OF PART GRANT AND PART CREDIT WE OFFER AN                            ASSISTANCE PROGRAM DENOMINATED EXCLUSIVELY IN ECONOMIC TERMS THE MAJOR                            NEW COMPONENT OF THIS PROGRAM WOULD BE A MULTIYEAR GRANT RPT GRANT FOR ACQUISITION OF GEOTHERMAL                            POWER INSTALLATIONS THIS FEATURE OF THE PROGRAM WOULD NOT RPT NOT NEED TO BE HANDLED THROUGH AID EVEN THOUGH THE FUNDS MIGHT BE INCLUDED                            IN THE FAA LEGISLATION THE OPERATION COULD BE DONE ON A STRAIGHT                            REIMBURSEMENT BASIS TO US CONTRACTORS AGAINST PROOF OF SATISFACTORY                            PERFORMANCE IN INSTALLATION OF THE GEOTHERMAL PLANTS13 SINCE THIS COMPONENT WOULD BE ON A GRANT BASIS AND WOULD BE OVER AND                            ABOVE OUR NORMAL AID PROGRAMS IT WOULD NATURALLY RESULT IN A BUDGETARY                            AND FOREIGN EXCHANGE SAVINGS TO THE GOP                            FOR EXPENSIVE PROGRAMS TO WHICH THEY ARE ALREADY COMMITTED IN ANY EVENT                            THESE BUDGETARY AND FOREIGN EXCHANGE SAVINGS COULD CONSEQUENTLY BE USED                            IN A FUNGIBLE FASHION IN LIEU OF THE CASH GRANTS WHICH THE GOP HAS BEEN SEEKING FROM US FOR THE                            ACQUISITION OF MILITARY EQUIPMENT14 THIS SORT OF TRANSACTION WOULD THEREFORE ENABLE US TO TERMINATE OUR                            GRANT MILITARY ASSISTANCE PROGRAM TO THE PHILIPPINES PERMIT THEM TO                            ESTABLISH THE MILITARY PURCHASING MISSION THEY WISH TO INSTALL IN THE                            UNITED STATES AND RESULT IN THE DISESTABLISHMENT OF JUSMAG PHILIPPINES                            I WOULD EXPECT THAT AS ALLIES THE PHILIPPINES WOULD STILL BE ELIGIBLE                            FOR FMS CREDIT PROGRAMS FOR GUARANTEED                            LOANS AND PERHAPS ALSO FOR SOME GRANT FUNDS WHICH WOULD COVER THE                            COSTS OF TRAINING FILIPINOS IN US SERVICE SCHOOLS15 IN THE LONG RUN IT WOULD LEAVE IN PHILIPPINE HANDS THE ULTIMATE                            DECISIONS ABOUT THE AMOUNTS OF MONEY IT WISHES TO SPEND FOR MILITARY                            EQUIPMENT THE KINDS OF EQUIPMENT AND THE ORDER OF PRIORITIES IN ITS                            ACQUISITION WHILE IT WOULD AT LEAST FOR A WHILE RESULT IN LESS                            EFFICIENCY IT WOULD CREATE MORE SENSE OF SELFRELIANCE AND                            RESPONSIBILITY AS WELL AS REDUCE ADMINISTRATIVE FRICTIONS SINCE IT IS                            DOUBTFUL THAT PRESIDENT MARCOS WOULD PERMIT THE MILITARY TO REALIZE ALL THE                            DOLLAR BENEFITS THAT WOULD FLOW FROM THE PROPOSED GEOTHERMAL POWER                            PROGRAM IT WOULD PROBABLY ALSO RESULT IN THE LONG RUN IN A SMALLER                            ANNUAL ACQUISITION OF MILITARY EQUIPMENT BY THE PHILIPPINES AND HENCE                            LESS CHANCE OF INAPPROPRIATE AND WASTEFUL PROCUREMENT 16 FINALLY BY CONCENTRATING ON ELECTRIC POWER GENERATION THE US WILL                            BE DOING SOMETHING MORE VITAL FOR THE PHILIPPINES AND MORE LASTING THAN                            THE PROVISION OF MILITARY EQUIPMENT IN AN EARLIER GENERATION US                            CREATION OF A PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEM IN THE PHILIPPINES HAS ENABLED THIS                            COUNTRY TO HAVE A LITERATE AND SKILLED POPULATION WELL AHEAD OF ITS                            NEIGHBORS BY DEVELOPING AN ELECTRIC POWER SYSTEM AND IDENTIFYING IT AS                            A US PROGRAM IN THE PHILIPPINES WE MAY BE ABLE TO HELP MEET THE MOST                            PRESSING NEED OF THE CURRENT GENERATION OF FILIPINOS WHICH IS TO FIND                            GAINFUL EMPLOYMENT FOR THE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF THEIR YOUNG CITIZENS                            WHO ARE ANNUALLY PROVING SURPLUS TO THE NEEDS OF THE AGRICULTURAL SECTOR                            AND SEEK INDUSTRIAL JOBS WITHOUT ELECTRICAL ENERGY THESE JOBS CAN NOT                            BE CREATED WITH IT PLUS INTELLIGENT LEADERSHIP AND GOOD ORGANIZATION                            THERE IS THE PROSPECT THAT THAT THEY CAN BE CREATED17 IN GENERAL I THINK THE AMOUNTS TO BE INVOLVED IN THIS NEW GRANT AID                            PROGRAM SHOULD BE THE SAME AS WE HAVE BEEN PREPARED TO OFFER IN THE                            GRANT MILITARY AID PROGRAM50 MILLION PER YEAR THIS PLUS THE NORMAL                            AID PL 480 EXIM CCC FMS AND GUARANTEED LOAN PROGRAMS COULD ADD                            UP TO NEARLY 2 BILLION AS PREVIOUSLY CITED HOWEVER BECAUSE THE                            GEOTHERMAL PROGRAM WOULD BE BUILT AROUND CONCRETE PRODUCTION UNITS THE                            SUMS TO BE APPROPRIATED MIGHT HAVE TO BE CAST IN NUMBERS NOT QUITE SO                            ROUND AS THE PUTATIVE MILITARY PROGRAM18 SINCE THIS RECOMMENDATION IS CAST IN TERMS OF PROPOSALS FOR THE NEXT                            ADMINISTRATION IT IS INAPPROPRIATE TO SUGGEST THAT THESE PROPOSALS BE                            DISCUSSED WITH PHILIPPINE AUTHORITIES AT THIS TIME HOWEVER I SHOULD                            PERHAPS RECORD MY VIEW THAT AT THE APPROPRIATE POINT THE ESSENCE OF                            THE GEOTHERMAL SCHEME SHOULD FIRST BE RAISED WITH DEFENSE SECRETARY                                ENRILE WHO                            WOULD BE THE OFFICIAL MOST DIRECTLY CONCERNED BY ITS IMPLICATIONS AND                            THE ONE MOST LIKELY TO GRASP ITS TOTAL IMPORTSULLIVAN	19761129
