Middle East For the Secretary from                            McCloskey1 Following are texts of Javits                        letter signed by 75 SenatorsAnother Senator                            signed the letter after its release bringing the number of signatories                            to 76 released today and the Percy letter which was not rpt not released:2 Dear Mr President: You will recall that last December a substantial                        majority of the Senate wrote you urging a reiteration of our nations                        longstanding commitment to Israels security by a policy of continued                        military supplies and diplomatic and economic supportOn December 9 1974 71 Senators signed a letter to                            President Ford criticizing the                            United Nations for dealing with the PLO                            and for UNESCO expulsion of Israel                            The Senators letter urged Ford                            to reiterate our nations longstanding commitment to Israels security                            by a policy of continued military supplies and diplomatic and economic                            support Israels Foreign Relations: Selected                                Documents volume 3: 19741977 Document 533 Since 1967 it has been American policy that the ArabIsrael conflict                        should be settled on the basis of secure and recognized boundaries that are                        defensible and direct negotiations between the nations involved We believe                        that this approach continues to offer the best hope for a just and lasting                        peace4 While the suspension of the secondstage negotiations is regrettable the                        history of the ArabIsrael conflict demonstrates that any Israeli withdrawal                        must be accompanied by meaningful steps toward peace by its Arab                        neighbors5 Recent events underscore Americas need for reliable allies and the                        desirability of greater participation by the Congress in the formulation of                        American foreign policy Cooperation between the Congress and the President                        is essential for Americas effectiveness in the world During this time of                        uncertainty over the future direction of our policy we support you in                        strengthening our ties with nations which share our democratic traditions                        and help to safeguard our national interests We believe that the special                        relationship between our country and Israel does not prejudice improved                        relations with other nations in the region6 We believe that a strong Israel constitutes a most reliable barrier to                        domination of the area by outside parties Given the recent heavy flow of                        Soviet weaponry to Arab states it is imperative that we not permit the                        military balance to shift against Israel7 We believe that preserving the peace requires that Israel obtain a level                        of military and economic support adequate to deter a renewal of war by                        Israels neighbors Withholding military equipment from Israel would be                        dangerous discouraging accommodation by Israels neighbors and encouraging                        a resort to force8 Within the next several weeks the Congress expects to receive your                        foreign aid requests for fiscal year 1976 We trust that your                        recommendations will be responsive to Israels urgent military and economic                        needs We urge you to make it clear as we do that the United States acting                        in its own national interests stands firmly with Israel in the search for                        peace in future negotiations and that this premise is the basis of the                        current reassessment of US policy in the Middle East9 Respectfully yours End text10 Percy decided to send his                            antiJavits letter as a personal                        message from him to the President only Following is text of Percy letter:11 Dear Mr President: In view of the letter on the Middle East circulated                        in the Senate by a number of my distinguished colleagues I wish to directly                        express to you my own position12 I concur with the cosigners in their profound support for the security                        and survival of the state of Israel however I do not believe that an                        expression of concern for the interests of only one party to the conflict is adequate at a time when                        American good will toward all the parties is required in order to facilitate                        a fair and equitable settlement13 I am interested that the administration has chosen to reassess its                        policies and I am heartened that Secretary Kissinger has agreed to consult with the Congress as part of                        the reassessment Since the goal of all of us is to promote a just and                        equitable peace in the region it is important that those consultations take                        place in an atmosphere of mutual confidence and with candor The originators                        of the abovementioned letter who are so knowledgeable about the problems                        garblein the Middle East will have much to contribute to such                        consultations14 In regard to Israel I believe strongly and without equivocation of any                        sort that the United States has an absolute moral obligation to provide                        diplomatic political and appropriate levels of economic and military                        assistance support during the difficult time of negotiation and during the                        rearrangements following negotiation With such continuing American support                        and with determined efforts by the Government of Israel to achieve a                        successful negotiation I believe that Israel can finally achieve the peace                        security and the essential recognition of her neighbors which she has long                        sought and deserved15 In regard to the Arab states I believe strongly and without equivocation                        that the United States by continuing diplomatic effort can build on what                        has already been accomplished in improving our relations with Arab leaders                        on the basis of understanding and trust The progress which has already been                        achieved gives hope that the Arab states will realize that our approach to                        peace in the area rests on a basis of concern for all the parties just as                        we seek peace and security for all the parties I have outlined in my recent                        report to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee the steps that Arab states                        in my opinion can take to demonstrate their desire for a peaceful and                        lasting settlement of the Mideast conflict16 Obviously the search for peace will succeed only when the parties                        directly involved are prepared to make the concessions necessary to a                        settlement I deeply believe that the process of accommodation which is so                        long in coming could be accelerated if direct talks would be                        undertaken17 It is my hope that the executive and legislative branches will reach                        substantial consensus on Middle East policy as a result of consultation                        within the context of the reassessment and that Israel and the Arab states                        will reach agreement soon on positive steps toward peace in their own mutual                        interest18 Sincerely Charles H Percy                        United States SenatorEnd

                      Arab states move to improved and more active relationships we do not                        believe there will be any real change in Irans desire for close ties with                        US and USN in Gulf Nevertheless we believe USG should recognize changing Iranian public                        stance and give careful consideration to proposed naval activities or use of                        Iranian facilities which might appear to conflict with that stance End summary1 As reported in Wireless File of May 5 Shah told London Observer that he wanted any permanent American military presence                        removed from the Persian Gulf area including the American naval base in                        Bahrain At same time Shah said he expects Iraq to agree to a similar                        exclusion of Soviet bases in the Gulf This is a more explicit description                        of GOI position on Gulf security than has                        normally been presentedie that Iran believed security should be in hands                        of littoral states and that these states should not depend on super power

remain in                        order to keep a strategic balance New element in Observer article is specific mention of removal of American                        presence at Bahrain As noted above Shah hedged this position by saying Iraq                        would have to agree to exclusion of Soviet bases in Gulf Story has not been                        played by local press suggesting either that papers quotation of Shah is                        not sanctioned as GOI policy position or                        that GOI does not want to highlight the                        issue on the eve of Shahs visit to Washington It is of course possible                        that reporter misquoted or misinterpreted the Shah2 Whatever the explanation for the statement in wake of IranIraq Accord                        and mutual IranianArab efforts to strengthen ties we believe we may                        anticipate some similar movement in Iranian rhetoric towards Arab viewpoints                        and vice versa We understand that both sides are not allowing nomenclature                        for Gulf to stand in way of expressions of cooperationwhile neither                        however is yielding its respective position on Persian or Arab designation                        Although GOI will be cautious in its                        evolving relations with Iraqis and other Arabs it is possible that GOI may find itself engaged in Gulf summitry                        or negotiations for nonaggression pacts or other such diplomatic business                        Certainly the flow of Arab visitors to Tehran shows no sign of abating and                            GOI seems to find process useful not                        the least for internatl political reasons3 We do not believe these changes in Iranian rhetoric or diplomatic                        manifestations will bring any basic change over the near term in substance                        of Iranian position on realities in Gulf particularly GOIs perceived value of US Navy in this                        region Iran is committed to development of a blue water navy and is depending heavily on USN for assistance in that endeavor Shah has                        remarked on several occasions that he personally appreciates the ready and                        effective cooperation of the USN We doubt                        that he would take inconsistent and unfriendly step of actively pushing for                            COMIDEASTFOR to leave Bahrain                        and the Gulf but he is trying to carry water on both shoulders Therefore                        Shah might be reluctant now to send emissary to Bahrain to support presence                        of COMIDEASTFOR as he did last                        year or to otherwise oppose its departure if demanded by other major                        littoral states4 In these changing circumstances we believe that we should be sensitive to                        Shahs public position on Gulf security and give very careful consideration                        to the frequency duration and public exposure of ship visits and joint                        exercises Also P3 operations at Bandar Abbas should be examined for their                        continuing utility and appropriateness This more complicated matter will be                        subject of a forthcoming messageMiklos	19750514

nine persons among high ranking American officials who                        are to be killed as a punishment for the Americans Telephone caller                        attributed murders to

frequently with the CherikhayeFedaiyeKhalq                        Peoples Sacrifice Guerrillas Marxist group2 Since May 4 two military officers assigned to MLG detachment have been under surveillance by unknown persons                        Surveillance developed a fixed pattern in that officers were regularly                        followed in the evening never in the morning A counter check was                        established which confirmed the surveillance pattern On day before Shaffer                        and Turner murders the pattern was broken ie there was no indication of                        surveillance We presume that surveillance of two MLG officers was linked to assassinations possibly as a move to decoy us or as alternate                        targets3 After drafting reftel we learned that                        boobytrapped briefcase was left in victims car It was exploded by police                        bomb squad4 We have unconfirmed report that SAVAK

               close similarity to earlier attacks on Iranian officials It is plain that                        terrorist groups are acquiring a greater capacity to execute attacks on                        designated targets We do not believe this indicates any change in public                        sentiments towards American military assistance to Iran or Americans in

Message from Secretary to Shah1 Please deliver following message from Secretary to the Shah during the                        morning of May 282 Begin text: Your Imperial Majesty: As we discussed                        during your visit to Washington ten days ago our thinking on how to advance                        the dialogue between oil producers other developing countries and the oil                        consuming countries has evolved Today I put forward a proposed approach to                        the dialogue in the IEA which I will follow up tomorrow at the OECDSimilar                            messages were sent to Saudi Prince Fahd Algerian President Boumediene Venezuelan Foreign Minister                            Escovar and Brazilian Foreign Minister Azerada da Silveira                            Documentation on the US activities in the IEA and the OECD and the convening of the second                            preparatory conference Prepcon is in Foreign Relations 19691976 volume XXXVII                                Energy Crisis 19741980 For the text of Kissingers statement at the May 27                            IEA meeting see the Department of State Bulletin June 23 1975 pp 838844 He addressed the OECD Ministerial Council on May 29 see                            ibid pp 849855 I hope it will break the impasse This                        approach owes much to discussions we have had and which our associates have                        had together I hope it will recommend itself to you3 The first step as I see it would be to reconvene the preparatory meeting                        in the same format as before The time could be relatively soon certainly a                        matter of months as I see no reason for delay I suggest that the format                        remain the same to avoid a tedious nonproductive negotiation over who                        would attend and what the rules of procedure might be Clearly we have more                        important business to do than that4 The second step would be for the preparatory meeting to agree on the                        creation of a number of commissions to deal with the critical issues in                        relationships between developing and developed countries Thus commissions                        might be set up for energy for the problems of the most seriously affected                        nations and for raw materials Conceivably there would be others Each                        commission would review all aspects of the problem assigned to it: Including                        finance investment trade and production5 The way in which each commission proceeds about its work would depend in                        considerable measure on the nature of work already being done in the field                        For the must seriously affected there is already much activity and the                        commissions role would be essentially to monitor to supplement and to                        orient that work giving it the thrust and purpose it must have The                        commission on raw materials would have a similar role In the case of                        energy since there is no existing international organization in which the                        basic questions are dealt with the commission should also function as a                        means of addressing and resolving the underlying substantive issues6 In each case I would envisage that the basic issues that have been raised                        be addressed Under raw materials for example you would no doubt wish to                        raise the question of terms of trade And we wish on our side to consider how adequate resources can                        be obtained for the development of raw materials and how in general raw                        material markets can be made to function more efficiently Actual                        negotiations on commodities would remain the purview of already existing                        commodity groups such as for coffee cocoa tin7 Clearly we would want to limit membership in the commissions to assure                        their effectiveness I think we both are anxious to avoid a new UNCTAD In                        my speech today I suggested that we seek to limit the membership by applying                        objective criteria For raw materials for example we could include those                        countries for which exports or imports for food and other nonoil raw                        materials constitute a certain minimum percentage of their total national                        product and set that threshhold high enough to keep the numbers within                        reason We could do the same in energy For the most seriously affected we                        would have to seek another formula one in which representative countries                        with the lowest capita income were chosen along with the traditional and new                        donors8 This proposed approach Your Imperial Majesty has two origins First our                        own thinking within the American administration on raw materials and other                        issues of the relationship between developed and developing countries has                        been evolving over the last several months I expressed some of the first                        implications of our new thinking in a speech at Kansas City two weeks                            agoSee footnote 7                                Document 125 I will have something more to say about                        them tomorrow at the OECD meeting9 The second source is the realization that it would be difficult if not                        impossible to find a basis on which oil producers and consumers could                        discuss the new problems of energy without addressing the entire range of                        relationships between developed and developing countries10 My proposal is thus brought forward in a spirit of conciliation and                        innovation In doing so I do not think we should attempt to dictate too                        closely the timeframe of the work of the commissionsthey could work                        simultaneously or consecutively and might depending on the difficulty of                        the task at hand require a shorter or longer span of timenor should we                        attempt to structure too precisely their relationship to each other My                        intent rather is to find an approach which recognizes both the essential                        unity of the developing countries in seeking an improved relationship with                        the developed countries and the great diversity of interests forums and                        subjects to be addressed11 I hope this approach will as it is intended meet many of the concerns                        that the Iranian representative at the Paris preparatory meeting expressed                        and that we have since discussed Under Secretary Robinson is at                        the disposition of your associates to discuss this concept if they wish I                        hope Your Imperial Majesty that the Iranian Government will find it                        possible to support this concept so that we may soon relaunch the dialogue                        between developed and developing countries including on the essential issue                        of energy I know that is your wish I assure you that it is also most                        sincerely our wish Warm regards Henry A                            Kissinger End textKissinger	19750528

response to reftel the Imperial Court                        transmitted afternoon of May 29 the following message to you from the Shah:                            Begin text May 29 1975 Dear Mr Secretary: I                        have received through Ambassador Helms your message of May 28 1975 concerning the resumption                        of the dialogue between oil producers other developing countries and the                        industrial nations I appreciate very much the efforts that are being made                        by your government and especially by yourself in breaking the impasseAs stated earlier we remain ready to undertake the dialogue any time that                        the countries involved are prepared to embark upon a serious and meaningful                        discussion of issues of major interest to each other in order to reach                        concrete results within a reasonable period rather than to continue endless                        debate I would therefore agree with the reconvening of the preparatory                        meeting as early as feasible in Paris with its previous composition to                        complete its work for the launching of the future work on the dialogueAs it had been discussed before we would concur with the establishment of a                        number of working groups or commissions at the expert or higher levels in                        order to prepare the ground for reaching decisions and conclusions In                        addition to the three areas identified by you namely: energy raw materials                        and the problems of most seriously affected countries it may be necessary                        as you have also mentioned to set up additional working groups or                        commissions perhaps on development and finance problems of interest to the                        oil exporting countries and other developing nationsAs regards the format of these working groups or commissions we would have                        no objection to limiting their membership on the basis of certain objective                        criteria for the purpose of efficiency provided that genuine representation                        of interested nations is assured In this context it appears that the                        selection of membership by the preparatory meeting itself may raise the                        objection of most of the developing countries that will be excluded from the                        dialogue In order to avoid such criticism it would be advisable to                        consider as previously suggested the establishment of an intergovernmental                        conference of an enlarged body of nations to be selected by their                        respective groups which in turn would constitute the proposed commissions                        or working groups with a more limited membership These bodies may then                        bring the result of their deliberations to the intergovernmental conference                        for necessary decisions or conclusionsIt has been our view from the outset that under the enlarged context of                        discussion it would be rather difficult to treat all of the subjects in the                        same detail or depth especially taking account of the work already done at                        various international fora However if we are expected to lend our support                        and to make a contribution to the solution of major world economic problems                        that have not been given the necessary priority or in certain cases                        neglected in different international organizations then our conference                        will have to address itself to such important and global issues to the                        extent required with a view to reaching decisions or understandings that                        can be implemented either directly or by other organizations or can                        provide impetus to the ongoing work as the case may beIn conclusion I would stress that for the dialogue to be fruitful and                        conclusive it would be necessary for all concerned to approach the problems                        of vital or major interest to the participants with a spirit of cooperation                        and conciliation with a view to arriving at just and equitable solutions I                        am glad to note that your message and your views expressed in our Washington                        meeting reflect that spirit Our representative to the preparatory meeting

Iraqs victory over the Barzaniled Kurds                        and the simultaneous rapprochement with Iran are in foreign and domestic                        political terms the equivalent of the landmark March 1973 oil settlement                        with the Western companies In the same way that the latter Accord removed                        the obstacles to rapid economic development in cooperation with the West                        the March 1975 events have eliminated the most serious threat to the regime                        and opened up possibility of regional stability The big winner is Saddam                            Hussein who now completely dominates Iraqi policymaking and                        has brought Iraq an internal stability unprecedented since 1958 Although he                        has many enemies they will have difficulty denigrating this accomplishment                        For the US the removal of major obstacles to resumption of relations and                        the anticipated decline in relative Soviet influence are big pluses                        Progress toward an ArabIsraeli settlement is the factor most likely to                        determine the pace of a return to normal relations with US Commercially                        Iraq could be a billion dollar market for US exports within three years                        If the regime continues to disavow the spread of Baathism relations with                        the conservative Arab states of the Arabian Peninsula should also rapidly                        improve In short this regime has reentered the international system in                        serious pursuit of its national goals of stability and rapid modernization                        As in the case of Algeria however ideological hostility and suspicion of                        the US will be a characteristic of the regime for years to come The                        combat experienced well equipped Iraqi Army must now be considered a factor                        in any new ArabIsraeli war End summary2 As elsewhere foreign policy is a projection of national strength and                        cohesion and it is the emergence of Saddam                            Hussein as the unrivaled leader that has enabled Iraq to make                        dramatic foreign policy changes Saddam is now 39 years old dynamic and                        active despite a slipped disc and being overweightThe Interests Section sent a biography of Saddam Hussein in telegram 609 from                            Baghdad June 7 Ibid D7502000960 Through a combination of                        shrewd political moves ruthlessness and the use of the most effective                        police state to have ever been constructed in the Arab world Saddam has                        succeeded in eliminating most of his rivals There is still talk about                        Saddams rivalry with President alBakr the military vs civilian wing of                        the party and active opposition within the army but there is little                        evidence to support this conventional wisdom Bakr is 61 years old in                        failing health and by most accounts working in harmony with Saddam to whom                        he is related The decimation of the military wing of the party which began                        shortly after the Baath seized power in 1968 is now complete Young party                        leaders loyal to Saddam are firmly in control The army remains a question                        mark but Saddam has devoted top priority for many years to assure control                        of it through a system of loyal Baath officers and informer networks Army                        interests must always be considered but it is my belief that it is tightly                        under control by the party The unprecedented military parade to celebrate                        the victory over the Kurds and other forms of public recognition suggest                        that the regime is increasingly confident of this control Regime would                        however be most reluctant to issue orders that might cause opposition                        within the army such as military action against Syria3 The principal instruments that Saddam has used to achieve this dominant                        position are the Baath Party and the security services The Party Congress                        in January 1974 brought competent young men loyal to him into the party                        leadership In the November 1974 Cabinet reshuffle these same men moved into                        Ministerial positionsSee Document 265 This reshuffle considerably increased                        cohesiveness of regime by A eliminating or downgrading all elements except                        Saddams men and trusted technocrats and B giving responsibility for                        executing policy to the same men who hold political power In the process it                        made a mockery of the National Front and narrowed the regimes base The                        Communists and the Baath panArab leadership are both known to be displeased                        with their diminishing roles Saddam is expected to move against them                        gradually and by buying them off rather than by coercion The recent                        appointment of a key figure in the panArab leadership as Ambassador to the                        GDR may be the precursor of such a strategy Should either the ICP or panArab leadership attempt to                        challenge Saddam they will almost certainly be dealt with ruthlessly In                        short this regime has achieved unprecedented stability for post1958 Iraq                        The number of foreign visits Saddam has taken in the past three months                        Libya France Algeria Tunisia USSR                        Iran Bulgaria Hungary Rumania and GDR suggest he shares this                        assessment4 Economic policyRegime is now in a strong position to concentrate on its                        economic development and has taken many important steps to streamline the                        bureaucracy attract the best Western technology and devote its oil revenue                        estimated at 6 billion in 1974 to rapid industrialization and                        agricultural development the sick sector It is going to face massive                        problems of organization shortages of trained manpower and materials and                        most seriously of all the contradiction inherent in an authoritarian                        security conscious regime that restricts initiative and the exercise of                        responsibility and imposes arbitrary travel and other restrictions on its                        own and foreign technicians it is trying to attract Nevertheless regime is                        committed to rapid economic development and its massive oil reserves give it                        a good chance of succeeding albeit at a slower pace than planned5 Foreign affairsThe dominant characteristics of Iraqi foreign policy from                        1968 to 1973 were unrelenting ideological warfare against Zionism                        imperialism and reaction the achievement of Arab unity under the aegis of                        the Baath Party through any means and the strategic alliance with the                            USSR Today the dominant                        characteristics are realism and pragmatism nonalignment and the                        achievement of Arab unity in its time Although the unrelenting opposition                        to Zionism remains even Iraqs policy toward the ArabIsraeli conflict has                        been modified This transformation                        was dictated by two immediate goals to end the perennial Kurdish separatist                        movement and to achieve the stability and Western technology necessary for                        economic development As result of the March 1973 IPC settlement the regime felt able to reduce its ties to the                            USSR and begin rapprochement with                        West Today it has diplomatic relations with all Western countries except                        the US and flourishing economic relations with all In 1974 the five                        largest exporters to Iraq excluding arms were in order of importance                        Japan FRG US France and the UK Almost all major projects during the past                        two years have gone to nonCommunist countries US firms are playing a                        major role the most dramatic of which is Boeing supplying of Iraqi Airways                        with its entire new fleet of 13 AC and                        undertaking a reorganization and training program that will last for at                        least five years6 The Kurdish rebellion and Irans direct support for it gave particular                        impetus to ending Iraqs international isolation Iraqi strategy was to                        crush rebellion militarily and to exert pressure on Iran through other                        states particularly other Arabs This required winning the confidence of                        leading Arabs and culminated in Saddam                            Husseins attendance at the Rabat SummitThe Arab League Summit held at Rabat Morocco in                            October 1974 was attended by the leaders of 20 Arab countries and                            Palestinian representatives and the dramatic rapprochement with                        Egypt Saudi Arabia and even King Hussein All of these states played a role in ending Iranian                        support for the Kurds although President Boumedienne got public credit The                        rapprochement with Iran gives every indication of enduring for the following                        reasons A both countries have a need for regional stability in order to                        concentrate on economic development B for the first time IraqiIranian                        interests have begun to coincide in oil matters particularly in maintaining                        prices and OPEC solidarity it is worth                        recalling that until two years ago major oil policy was still being made in                        London and C Accord is popular with Shia communities in both countries                        In Iraq it is virtually first thing this regime has done that is popular                        with Shias7 There is now some convincing evidence that the new realism and                        pragmatism were not tactics to end the Kurdish war but more farreaching                        Iraqis now talk openly of their realization that Arab unity is a distant                        goal and that meanwhile Arab solidarity is essential regardless of                        differences among the regimes This disavowal of Arab unity under Baath                        leadership has been given concrete expression in recent agreements with Arab                        states under which Iraq will prohibit political activity by Arab students                        inside Iraq and recruit students only through their respective                        governments Furthermore the regime is promoting govttogovt relations                        with all Arab states and clearly moving toward resolution of border and                        other problems with its neighbors including cessation of hostile propaganda against the reactionary                        regimes8 Renunciation of this major tenet of Baath ideology is taking place                        quietly It is being sublimated by a new emphasis on the NonAligned                        Movement in which Iraq clearly hopes to play a leadership role It tried                        very hard to have Baghdad be the site of the 1979 Summit but lost out to                        Havana It is bound to alienate the Baath panArab leadership but they are                        mostly nonIraqis and considered little threat As noted above Saddam                        strategy appears to be to deal gradually and in a noncoercive way with them                        as with other dissenters provided they do not actively oppose him9 Iraq will continue for some time to count on USSR as supplier of major weapons systems but it has already                        diversified its sources for other military equipment and training Soviets                        will also continue to be an important economic partner and Iraq will wish to                        maintain the prestige of its great power relationship But barring some                        unforeseen development the Soviets no longer have a position that enables                        them to influence Iraq policy in any significant way In fact there is                        widespread suspicion that the Soviets are tacitly supporting Syria in the                        Euphrates water conflict to show their disgruntlement with Iraq If given                        some credence this suspicion will result in further deterioration of Soviet                        position10 Almost all of the above developments are favorable to US interests as                        perceived from here and should bring closer the day of normalization of                        relations The timing should be left to Iraq because for them it is a major                        political step Nor should we expect any honeymoon when resumption comes                        The inbred suspicion and hostility of this regime toward the US will take                        many years to disappear Meanwhile we should continue to develop the                        booming Iraqi market for US goods and promote the new links that are                        gradually being established through US firms journalists and visits of                        prominent Americans11 It goes without saying that rapid movement toward an ArabIsraeli                        settlement is essential if we are to exploit fully the new situation Saddam                        has told Arab leaders that Iraq will not obstruct a settlement but since he                        does not believe it will be reached Iraq must prepare for war The Iraqi                        Army is now estimated at over 150000 men it is well equipped and has a                        year of combat experience against the Kurds and Iraqs eastern border is                        now secure It is virtually certain that in event of new war a large part of                        this force will move into Syria and Jordan if requested Iraq can also be                        counted on to promote the use of Arab economic power against Israel and its                        supporters In many ways therefore Iraq epitomizes the new confidence and                        strength of the Arab states which                        seen from Baghdad can only increase over at least the next five

            Ref: Athens 3370Dated May 1 Ibid1 During round two of the USGreek base negotiations we explored                            numerous aspects of future AmericanGreek defense cooperation Our                            efforts in the months ahead need to be directed primarily toward: a                            consolidating the bilateral understandings already reached through                            discussions among experts on both sides leading to arrangements which                            can later be endorsed at the political level and b insuring that the                            future GreekNATO relationship is                            clarified in a manner which provides for fullest possible Greek                            participation in the integrated military command structure Our new                            bilateral arrangements with Greece should be consistent with and                            complement the GreekNATO                            relationship2 We endorse Embassy Athens recommendation reftel that no date be considered now for a third plenary                            round of bilateral negotiations but we recognize we may have to revise                            our planning if Caramanlis and Bitsios push for an early third round when they meet the                            President and the Secretary in Brussels Our preference is to postpone                            such a round until well on into the fall and after issues have been                            resolved at the subgroup level By that time Greeks

proposals we                            plan to make on various issues and the Greek proposals for technical                            training and shareduse at facilities A tentative work program and                            timetable for joint planning purposes is set out below:A Tatoi: we understand that a decision on this subject cannot be delayed                            until round three and as indicated in State 109638Dated May 10 Ibid we are prepared to                            discuss this issue directly with GOG                            while investigating alternative sites in the weeks ahead A decision on                            this subject should be possible by early JuneB Homeporting: specific proposals for future US use of the pier at                            Elefsis and other residual homeporting facilities are being developed by                                DOD These will be ready for                            presentation to the Greeks in further technical level discussions in                            Athens by early JuneC Hellenikon Air Base: a comprehensive package of proposals to                            substantially reduce US personnel and visibility at Hellenikon is being                            developed by DOD After this work is                            completed a small team will be prepared to return to Athens to present                            this package in subgroup discussions with the Greeks If an agreement                            can be reached in the subgroup it could then be confirmed at the                            CalogerasStearns level Thereafter the US team would return to                            Washington and initiate action to draft an implementing technical                            agreement We do not desire to implement visible changes at the airbase                            until after subgroup agreement is confirmed by CalogerasStearns                            Changes however could be initiated before the formal technical                            agreement has been completed and signed if the Greeks feel the domestic                            political situation requires such action We appreciate that pressures                            may be heavy to move ahead quickly on Hellenikon but we would prefer to                            have the Greeks approach us to resume subgroup meetings rather than                            initiate action ourselves to fix the date We hope to complete                            preparations for further subgroup discussions by late June However a                            delay until early or midJuly would facilitate extensive staffing on                            this complex issueD Telecommunications: we are breaking down this issue into the same                            three categories discussed in round twoless than 1                                line not declassified defense communications system at other                            sites After staffing is                            completed in Washington we would be prepared to discuss these topics                            one by one in Athens preferably after work on the Hellenikon subgroup                            is finished This would suggest that telecommunications issues should be                            addressed some time in late July or August We would prefer to leave to                            Greek initiative the calling of future subgroup meetings on this                            subjectE SOFA: a draft revision of existing                            GreekUS SOFA agreements is now under                            preparation in DOD a process which will                            not be completed until midsummer It will embody specific alternatives                            discussed in Athens at the subgroup level It would be helpful to check                            with Economides and others in the Foreign Ministry to determine when                            they would prefer to resume bilateral SOFA discussions with usF Umbrella Agreement: we are putting off until further progress has been                            made bilaterally and in NATO the                            decision whether we will accommodate the Greek proposal for an umbrella                            agreement For internal purposes only we are putting together a                            counterdraft to the Greek text received in round two We would plan to                            seek comments from addressees and DOD on                            the merit of this redraft We wish to avoid discussion of this matter                            with the Greeks at the moment and to look at this question once more                            when the GreekNATO relationship is                            fully clarified4 Other Subjects: we will continue over the summer to examine those                            facilities in Greece deemed least essential to maintain in NSSM 215Document 33 Although some of these                            facilities were mentioned to the Greek side in round two we should                            avoid referring to these discussions even in the context of a                            tradeofffor example for Tatoi Least essential should not be read as                            not essential and it appears that interested US agencies who fund and                            manage these facilities do not agree that they are available as                            tradeoffs without a detailed eveluation of what we would obtain in                            return5 Comments by Embassy Athens and USNATO on the above time schedule would be

scheduled for delivery in Kansas City May 13The text of the speech delivered to the Kansas City                            International Relations Council in Kansas City Missouri is in                            Department of State Bulletin June 2 1975 pp                            713719 Secretary will state US                        readiness to attend new meeting of energy producerconsumer prepcon and to                        initiate bilateral consultations IEA                        countries France and producers to this purpose Speech will set forward                            US ideas on ways to begin serious                        discussion of raw materialscommodity problems which we hope will constitute                        basis for progress toward meeting concerns of many LDCs as developed at first Prepcon in Paris last month Text follows septel2 Proposals involve three main elements which will be presented in speech                        along following lines:First since both producers and consumers want a more reliable basis on                        which to do business we will propose that the multilateral trade                        negotiations now underway in Geneva develop new rules and procedures on such                        questions as freer access to supplies and markets promotion of mining and                        processing industries in these countries and settlement of disputesSecondly we are prepared to consider and discuss whether circumstances                        warrant new arrangements in individual commodities on a casebycase                        basisThirdly recognizing the importance of growth in raw material production to                        both producers and consumers we will propose that the World Bank explore                        new ways of financing raw material investment in producing countries We are                        particularly interested in exploring new ways of mobilizing capital and                        bringing it together with outside management and skills3 We believe successful dialogue along these lines could be best developed                        by making maximum use of existing multilateral fora eg MTNs existing commodity groups within UNCTAD framework and IBRD We                        have open mind about whether these institutions should be seized directly                        with joint initiatives from interested countries involved in                        producerconsumer prepcon or whether it would be preferable for prepcon to                        agree to present these and related proposals to a broader producerconsumer                        conference which would then discuss a more fully developed scenario for                        further negotiations in other forums While we believe former scenario                        likely result in getting serious discussion started earlier we would wish                        to have views of our partners in IEA and                        PC prepcon group before deciding on one or the other4 You should seek early opportunity to discuss these proposals and                        procedural options per para 3 above with appropriate officials in host                        government We will raise directly with Shah during his visit here this                            weekThe Shah visited the United States May                            1518 He met with Ford on May                            16 and told him: The influence of oil on Western inflation is 2                            percentthis is your figure Industrial inflation was 14 percent but the                            prices to us have gone up 35 percent But we must have some kind of                            agreement based on some tangible predictable relationship We must                            index or any other proposal which keeps our purchasing power intact                            Perhaps indexing to 2030 commodities although that might be                            difficult He added: My argument in Algiers was that we have to depend                            on the commodity trade But what happens to the Third World with oil                            and industrial prices going up What can we do The Saudis will follow                            usthey will always be a moderating element Between us we can do                            something interesting That will give us time for reconvening the Prepcon Ford did not directly respond to the Shahs remarks but                            instead asked how much oil Iran produced Ford Library National Security Adviser Memoranda of                            Conversations Box 11 The memorandum of conversation is

know you                        have been giving much thought to how we could overcome the impasse Today I                        made public in the IEA a proposal which I                        hope will relaunch the dialogueThe text of                                Kissingers statement at the                            May 27 IEA Ministerial meeting in Paris                            is in Department of State Bulletin June 23                            1975 pp 838844 The IEA Ministers                            published a communiqu in which they reiterated their determination                            that the Agency should contribute as far as problems connected with                            energy were concerned towards achievement of a regular and stable                            energy supply They further emphasized that solutions to current                            economic problems must be based on the principles of interdependence                            of all countries mutual support and shared responsibility so that all                            countries whatever their level of development may be recognized as                            partners in the

Central Foreign Policy                            Files D7501850370 It owes much to discussions which our                        associates have had together I hope it will recommend itself to you3 The first step as I see it would be to reconvene the preparatory meeting                        in the same format as before The time could be relatively soon certainly a                        matter of months as I see no reason for delay I suggest that the format                        remain the same to avoid a tedious nonproductive negotiation over who                        would attend and what the rules of procedure might be Clearly we have more                        important business to do than that4 The second step would be for the preparatory meeting to agree on the                        creation of a number of commissions to deal with the critical issues in                        relationships between developing and developed countries Thus commissions                        might be set up for energy for the problems of the most seriously affected                        nations and for raw materials Conceivably there would be others Each                        commission would review all aspects of the problem assigned to it: including                        finance investment trade and production5 The way in which each commission proceeds about its work would depend in                        considerable measure on the nature of work already being done in the field                        For the most seriously affected there is already much activity and the                        commissions role would be essentially to monitor to supplement and to                        orient that work giving it the thrust and purpose it must have The                        commission on raw materials would have a similar role In the case of                        energy since there is no existing international organization in which the                        basic questions are dealt with the commission should also function as a                        means of addressing and resolving the underlying substantive issues6 In each case I would envisage that the basic issues that have been raised                        be addressed Under raw materials for example you would no doubt wish to                        raise the question of terms of trade And we wish on our side to consider                        how adequate resources can be obtained for the development of raw materials                        and how in general raw material markets can be made to function more                        efficiently Actual negotiations on commodities would remain the purview of                        already existing commodity groups such as for coffee cocoa tin7 Clearly we would want to limit membership in the commissions to assure                        their effectiveness I think we both are anxious to avoid a new UNCTAD In my speech today I suggested that                        we seek to limit the membership by applying objective criteria For raw                        materials for example we could include those countries for which exports                        or imports for food and other nonoil raw materials constitute a certain                        minimum percentage of their total national product and set that threshold                        high enough to keep the numbers within reason We could do the same in                        energy For the most seriously affected we would have to seek another                        formula one in which representative countries with the lowest capita income                        were chosen along with the traditional and new donors8 This proposed approach Your Royal Highness has two origins First our                        own thinking within the American administration on raw materials and other                        issues of the relationship between developed and developing countries has                        been evolving over the last several months I expressed some of the first                        implications of our new thinking in a speech at Kansas City two weeks                            agoSee Document                            62 I will have something more to say about them tomorrow                        at the OECD meeting9 The second source is the realization that it would be difficult if not                        impossible to find a basis on which oil producers and consumers could                        discuss the new problems of energy without addressing the entire range of                        relationships between developed and developing countries10 My proposal is thus brought forward in a spirit of conciliation and                        innovation In doing so I do not think we should attempt to dictate too                        closely the timeframe of the work of the commissionsthat they could work                        simultaneously or consecutively and might depending on the difficulty of                        the task at hand require a shorter or longer span of timenor should we                        attempt to structure too precisely their relationship to each other My                        intent rather is to find an approach which recognizes both the essential                        unity of the developing countries in seeking an improved relationship with                        the developed countries and the great diversity of interests forums and                        subjects to be addressed11 I hope this approach will as it is intended meet many of the concerns                        that the Saudi representative at the Paris preparatory meeting expressed I                        hope Your Royal Highness that you will find it possible to support this                        concept so that we may soon relaunch the dialogue between developed and                        developing countries including on the essential issue of energy I know                        that that is your wish I assure you that it is also our own Warm regards                            Henry A Kissinger End textThe telegram is                            unsigned During a May 27 meeting Kissinger Giscard and Sauvagnargues discussed a possible future energy                            conference The Secretary said that France should reconvene the                            preparatory conference under French chairmanship and recommended that                            three commissions be established to deal with energy other raw                            materials and the problems of developing countries all the while                            insisting that energy must receive priority in emphasis over other raw                            materials He added that he thought the US and France could work                            together to make the conference a success because there were really no                            basic differences between them Sauvagnargues responded that the goal of the conference                            at the next stage should not be so much to reach conclusions as to                            establish a structure for future discussions and that such a meeting                            should be global While

frus1969-76v38p1d58	58 Telegram From the Department of State to All Diplomatic and Consular Posts	None	1975-05-15 00:21:00	None	None	113000 Subject: The US Response to Recent                    Developments in Southeast Asia and Elsewhere1 I want to share with each of you my thoughts on where we stand and how we                    should comport ourselves in light of recent developments particularly the                    events in Indochina The President first addressed these issues broadly in his                    State of the World message on April 10Document 55 My remarks to the American                    Society of Newspaper Editors on April 15For                            Kissingers remarks actually                        delivered on April 17 see Department of State Bulletin May 5 1975 p 557563 were likewise devoted to                    these problems Since then the President and I have spoken out on other                    occasions including my St Louis speech of May 12For Kissingers speech see ibid                        June 2 1975 pp 705712 I hope you and your staff have had a                    chance to read these various statements2 There is no denying that we have experienced serious setbacks and                    disappointments in recent weeks Some were beyond our control Some we inflicted                    upon ourselves As a consequence we must be prepared to face tests of our own                    resolve and staying power in the weeks and months to come Many here are                    inclined to discount the impact of the events in Southeast Asia on our                    international role They look upon the termination of the NorthSouth conflict                    with apparent relief They emphasize that the recent defeats are a consequence                    of shortcomings in the capabilities of our friends They underscore the unique                    features of the Indochina conflict and hope that other governments will not                    regard our actions there as indicative of a general retreat from overseas                    responsibilities They argue that the closing of this chapter of our Southeast                    Asia policy will permit a more effective deployment of our resources and                    commitments in the world3 While there is some validity to many of these views it would be idle and                    dangerous to leave the situation at that We cannot ignore the fact that we                    have indeed suffered some major reverses and proceed as if nothing had really                    happened America is a strong nation that canand willsolve its problems only                    by facing up to them Even those governments that have been most critical of our                    involvement in Vietnam which have most earnestly regretted the diversion of our                    resources and attention which our involvement produced and which most fervently                    hoped for an end to the fractious divisions in American opinion which it                    spawned now harbor questions about our ability and willingness to make those                    difficult decisions which are the lot of a great power We would be deluding                    ourselves if we discounted the evidence that what has happened in Indochinaand                    in Washingtonhas disquieted many of our friends especially in Asia We will                    have to respond to many of these concerns promptly and firmly Also we must                    recognize the fact that these events have serious implications for how we as a                    people see our role in the world We will have to do some major rethinking and                    work hard to shore up the domestic foundations of our policy Rhetoric alone                    will not do the job The impact of recent events will be measured by how we as a                    nation meet our challenges in the coming months4 In our dealings with foreign officials and leaders our conduct must be guided                    by several general considerations:A We must not dwell excessively on the past We need to look ahead That is the                    tone we intend to set here The President and I have made it clear that we                    intend to avoid a divisive national debate designed to apportion blame for                    developments in Indochina Recriminations are a luxury we can ill afford There                    is enough anguish and blame to go around Americans at home and abroad must                    conduct their national foreign policy                    debate with moderation tolerance and mutual respectB Without ignoring or denying past setbacks we must retain a sense of proportion                    about them This is no time to be apologetic or defensive about our role in the                    world A display of selfdoubt and timidity at this juncture would further                    undermine the confidence of our friends and diminish our adversaries incentives                    for restraint If we demonstrate a loss of national nerve now we will merely                    compound our future difficulties Thus we must convey with unmistakable clarity                    to potential adversaries that our current difficulties imply no slackening of                    our resolve to meet our commitments or to respond to challenges We will not be                    bellicose but neither will we be pushed around Above all we must convey to                    both adversaries and allies an impression of confidence in our purposes and                    steadiness in their implementationC We need to stand up for our views both in our bilateral contacts and in                    international forums Silence or defensiveness in the face of attacks on our                    motives and our record bear little place under normal circumstances they have                    no place now We need not apologize for our system our record of magnanimity to                    others or the major initiatives which we have taken in recent years to promote                    greater stability in global political relationships and to cope with structural                    problems in the world economy Our role in Indochina particularly is not a                    fitting subject for public selfcriticism We undertook our obligations there                    with honorable intent We endured major sacrifices on behalf of a country in                    which we sought no territorial economic or political advantage And our efforts                    helped to buy time for our Asian friends to strengthen their security and                    prosperityD The essentials of our foreign policy design remain intact Our relations with                    Japan and the Western European democracies are extraordinarily free of bilateral                    problems they are marked by greater equity and more intensive consultation than                    ever before The premises of our dtente strategy toward Moscow and Peking                    remain valid We will work to see that dtente continues to yield a balance of                    advantages and that potential adversaries do not seek to exploit what they may                    perceive as opportunities We expect further progress this year in limiting                    strategic arms deployments and expanding commercial and other bilateral                    exchanges with the Soviets and in proceeding on our course of normalization                    with the Chinese Despite a temporary setback in our Middle East diplomacy the                    parties to that conflict still recognize us as the only outside power capable of                    facilitating a settlement and we intend to persevere Our efforts to design a                    longer term response to key structural problems facing the global economy are                    bearing fruit We now possess flexible negotiating authority for the                    multilateral trade negotiations We have achieved a gratifying degree of                    solidarity with other consuming                    countries in the energy field the measures we have thus far taken are producing                    real shifts in the supply and demand picture for oil Our food initiatives have                    been well received and we expect to elaborate on them further in the months                    ahead We are beginning to develop a network of intensive and mutually                    beneficial ties with some of the more assertive and powerful resourcerich                    countries And we are prepared to search with compassion for solutions to the                    issues raised by the developing countriesassuming that realism and mutual                    cooperation infuse the international dialogue In short given this record of                    substantial accomplishment there is no excuse for masochistic selfdoubt and                    selfflagellation And given our military economic and technological strength                    we have an indispensable role to play in furthering global stability and                    prosperity5 Clearly reassurances from members of the executive branch however                    indispensable in conveying an impression of confidence and constancy will not                    put to rest all questions about our reliability There is no doubt that the                    public consensus underlying our policies needs extensive rebuilding There are                    significant forces preaching retrenchment Widespread skepticism does exist                    about the efficacy of military force to buttress our diplomacy The tendency to                    generalize and simplify foreign policy problems on the basis of our experience                    in Vietnam alone is evident in much of the medias commentary The Congress has                    become more assertive on foreign policy issues at precisely the moment when                    power on the Hill has become exceedingly diffuse The result of all these                    factors can be drift frustration and accommodation of special interests at the                    expense of the integrity of our larger foreign policy design and purposes6 Without ignoring these problems they must be placed in context for foreign                    audiences Recent disappointments have not demoralized the American public Our                    people retain a fundamental strength buoyancy optimism and magnanimity which                    has not been shaken by recent events In the face of a convulsive dozen years                    Americans and their institutions have shown a remarkable resiliency Nor is                    there any disposition to retreat from global responsibilities Recent polls on                        US public attitudes toward foreign policy                    issues indicate that most Americans recognize that the reality of                    interdependence is inescapable There remains remarkably strong support for the                    kind of cooperative international relationships and peacekeeping activities                    which have characterized US foreign policy for a                    generation I am convinced that the American people will continue to support a                    dynamic responsible role in world affairs grounded in policies that serve                    welldefined American interests Partly as a result of this I am also confident                    that over time we will be able to rebuild our partnership with Congress along                    the lines that I set forth in my Los                    Angeles speech of January 24See footnote 6 Document 52 The Congress has                    a vital role to play in our foreign policy in line with its constitutional                    responsibilities and the need to reflect the popular will in a democracy The                    administration is determined to forge a cooperative relationship with the                    legislative branch7 As we succeed in putting behind us the effects of Indochina we can display the                    effective and unified national policy that we and the world so badly need                    Realistically however we must accept the fact that we have difficult days                    ahead of us Since our national problems are on such wide international view                    you and your staff will have special responsibility to project the real values                    and interests of the United States in this difficult interim period I know that                    I can count on you to do so in the best traditions of the Foreign Service With                    your help I am confident that the United States will continue to be a major                    force for building a

                          IF INDIAN OFFICIALS WOULD COME TO US PRIVATELY WE COULD WORK OUT AN                            ACCOMMODATION IF THERE WAS ANYTHING THEY DID NOT LIKE THEY SHOULD TELL                            US SO THAT WE COULD TRY TO CORRECT IT I QUOTED WHAT CONGRESS PRESIDENT                            BARUA HAD SAID ABOUT US LAST NIGHT THE SAME POWERS WHO HAD WAGED WAR                            AGAINST INDOCHINA WERE NOW FOCUSING THEIR ATTENTION ON INDIA THESE                            IMPERIALIST POWERS DO NOT WANT SOCIALISM AND DEMOCRACY IN THIS COUNTRY                            AND RENEWED OUR PLEDGE THAT IF ANY AMERICAN IS GUILTY OF INTERFERENCE IN                            ANY WAY IN THE AFFAIRS OF THE INDIAN GOVERNMENT WE WOULD HAVE HIM OUT

SUCH                            THINGS AS LANDING RIGHTS EXCHANGE PROGRAMS AND PL 480 I SAID MAYBE                            YOU DONT WANT PL 480I ALSO POINTED OUT THAT INDIA CRITICISMS WERE BEING REPORTED IN THE US                            PRESS I FEARED THAT AMERICAN TOURISM IN INDIA WOULD BE AFFECTED4 I WOUND UP MY PRESENTATION SAYING THE I DID NOT WANT TO BE BLAMED FOR                            THE COLLAPSE OF INDIUS RELATIONS I DID NOT WANT TO SEE THIS HAPPEN                            BUT I WAS CONCERNED THE ATMOSPHERE IN THE US WAS VERY SENSITIVE OUR                            POLICIES WERE BEING REVIEWED THERE WAS NO TELLING WHAT THE EFFECT OF                            CRITICISMS ON US CONCLUSIONS MIGHT BE SOME DAYS AGO SENATOR HUMPHREY                            SPEAKING OF INDIA HAD SAID THAT WE WOULD TAKE CRITICISM BUT NOT ABUSE                            SENATOR MANSFIELD SAID THAT THE US SHOULD GET OUT OF ASIA THINGS COULD                            NOT BE SALVAGED I TOLD HIM THAT WHEN I WAS IN WASHINGTON I WANTED TO                            ASK THE CONGRESS FOR SOME RUPEES TO SPEND TO BENEFIT INDIA BUT I FEARED                            THAT I WOULD HAVE A DIFFICULT TIME CONVINCING THE MEMBERSHIP5 CHAVAN SEEMED SHAKEN BY WHAT I                            HAD HAD TO SAY AND DID NOT REPLY AT LENGTH OBVIOUSLY ILL AT EASE HE                            SAID THAT HE WAS GRATEFUL TO ME FOR SPEAKING ABOUT THESE THINGS INDIA                            HAD MATTERS ABOUT WHICH IT HAD TO COMMENT FRANKLY IT WOULD CONTINUE TO                            DO SO AND WOULD EXPECT THE US TO DO SO SIMILARLY INDIA WAS A DEMOCRACY                            LIKE THE US AND PEOPLE HAD THEIR OWN OPINIONS HE DIDNT KNOW WHAT WAS                            SAID AT THE CONFERENCE THE PREVIOUS EVENING BUT WHAT MATTERED WAS WHAT                            THE PRIME MINISTER AND THE FOREIGN MINISTER SAID HE REPEATED THIS IDEA                            LATER: WE SHOULD NOT LISTEN TO THE OTHERS ONLY TO HIM AND THE PRIME                            MINISTER I TOLD HIM US CABINET OFFICERS SPOKE ONLY FOR OFFICIAL POLICY                            HE SAID THAT THE GOI HAD GIVEN ITS                            ASSESSMENT OF EVENTS IN SOUTHEAST ASIA IT DID NOT WANT TO HURT THE US                            BUT THIS WAS ITS VIEWS INDIA WAS GETTING BLAMED FOR NOT SUPPORTING THE                            US6 IN THE DISCUSSION THAT FOLLOWED SEVERAL THINGS OF INTEREST EMERGED                            WHEN I MENTIONED OUR ARMS SALES POLICY AND THAT WE HAD NOT EVEN SOLD ANY                            ARMS TO PAKISTAN YET CHAVAN WAS                            AWARE OF THIS AND POINTED OUT THAT HE HAD ALREADY SAID THAT INDIA SHOULD                            WAIT AND SEE HOW OUR ARMS SALES POLICY IS CARRIED OUT I MENTIONED HOW                            MANY ARMS FRANCE HAD SOLD TO PAKISTAN WITHOUT CRITICISM CHAVAN TOOK THE LINE THAT FRANCE WAS                            SIMPLY SEEKING COMMERCIAL SALES INDIA EXPECTED MORE FROM THE US                                CHAVAN RETURNED TO THE                            SUBJECT OF SOUTHEAST ASIA AND SAID THAT IN THE LIGHT OF RECENT EVENTS                            THERE IT WAS HIS VIEW THAT INDIA AND THE US SHOULD NOW HAVE A FRIENDLY                            DIALOGUE HE SAID THAT I SHOULD GO BACK TO THE US WITH THIS IDEA7 I DIDNT WANT TO PROLONG THE CONVERSATION AS I FELT THAT I HAD MADE MY                            POINT I SUMMED UP THE SITUATION SAYING THAT I HATED TO SEE USINDIA                            RELATIONS RISKED BY IRRESPONSIBLE TALK WE WERE NOT FASCISTS WE HAD NOT                            TRAINED SONGBIRDS TO SPY IN INDIA THE AMERICAN LEADERSHIP WAS                            PARTICULARLY SENSITIVE NOW AND WE HAD BEEN CAREFUL WHAT WE HAD SAID                            ABOUT INDIA WE HAD NOT SAID ANYTHING ABOUT SIKKIM AND WE HAD NOT                            CRITICIZED INDIAS NUCLEAR TEST IT WAS A RIDICULOUS SITUATION IN WHICH                            OUR RELATIONS WITH THE SOVIET UNION WERE BETTER THAN THOSE WITH INDIA                            UNTIL MRS GANDHI HAD SPOKEN ABOUT                            A WEEK AGO I HAD NEVER HEARD THE US MENTIONED AS A FRIEND8 CHAVAN CALLED ATTENTION TO THE                            RESTRAINT WHICH HE HAD EXERCISED WHEN HE HAD BEEN QUESTIONED ABOUT THE                            US AT THE AIRPORT ON HIS RETURN TO INDIA ON THE PREVIOUS DAY HE HAD                            BEEN CAREFUL AS HE                            ORDINARILY IS HE SAID THAT WHEN I RETURNED TO THE US HE WANTED ME TO                            GO BACK WITH A WARMER FEELING HE HAD TOLD THE INDIAN CHAIRMEN OF THE                            SUBCOMMISSIONS TO GET TO WORK IF THE RESULTS WERE GOOD THEN THEY COULD                            SEE ABOUT THE COMMISSION MEETING IN WASHINGTON INDIA WANTED FRIENDLY                            RELATIONS WITH THE US HE DID NOT WANT HARD FEELINGS WHEN I STARTED TO                            LEAVE AFTER WE HAD TALKED ABOUT TWENTY FIVE MINUTES HE URGED ME TO                            STAY SAYING HE HAD RESERVED TIME FOR A LONGER TALK I NEVERTHELESS                            DEPARTED9 I DIDNT EXPECT THAT CHAVAN WOULD BE ABLE TO GIVE A SATISFACTORY                            ANSWER ON THE SPOT AND AS IS OBVIOUS HE DID NOT WE CANNOT ACCEPT A                            SITUATION IN WHICH WE LISTEN ONLY TO MRS GANDHI AND CHAVAN                            WHILE ANY OTHER MINISTER CAN SAY WHATEVER HE LIKES ABOUT US IT WILL                            NEVERTHELESS BE AN IMPROVEMENT IF THE RESTRAINT BEING CURRENTLY                            EXERCISED BY THE PRIME MINISTER AND THE FOREIGN MINISTER CONTINUES WE                            WILL SIMPLY HAVE TO WAIT AND SEE WHAT THE EFFECT OF MY PRESENTATION IS                            AND THEN ADJUST THE LEVEL OF OUR RELATIONS TO THE SITUATION WHICH                            EMERGES I ALSO LEARNED NOTHING FROM CHAVANS BRIEF REFERENCE TO THE SUBCOMMISSION HIS                            GOVERNMENT HAS APPARENTLY STILL MADE NO DECISION ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT TO                            PROCEED TO THE COMMISSION MEETING IN FACT CHAVAN HAD LITTLE TO SAY WAS FLUSTERED BUT NOW HAS A                            GOOD DEAL TO THINK ABOUT OF COURSE IT WILL BE MRS GANDHIS REACTION WHICH IS IMPORTANT AND                            THAT IS COMPLETELY UNPREDICTABLESAXBE	19750517

FROM INDIA TO TIBET RAN THROUGH SIKKIM IN THE                        NINETEENTH CENTURY NOT THROUGH BHUTAN AND THE BRITISH WISHED TO ENCOURAGE                        TRADE WITH TIBET IT WAS FELT THAT THE AREA HAD TO BE BROUGHT UNDER SOME                        CONTROL A CENTURY LATER INDIAS LEADERS  FEARING THAT THIS SAME TRADE                        ROUTE MIGHT SERVE AS A CHINESE INVASION ROUTE  CLAMPED THIS CONTROL STILL                        TIGHTER THE PRESSURE EXERTED FROM THE SOUTH FLUCTUATED FROM DECADE TO                        DECADE DEPENDING ON A VARIETY OF FACTORS BUT ESSENTIALLY ON THE DEGREE TO                        WHICH THE LOCAL RULER WAS ABLE TO MAINTAIN ORDER AND THE EXTENT OF THE                        DANGER TO THE AREAS SECURITY FROM EXTERNAL FORCES AS PERCEIVED BY THE                        BRITISH AND  LATER  INDIANS HISTORICALLY SIKKIMS SLIDE INTO TOTAL                        SUBORDINATION TO INDIA PROBABLY BEGAN WITH THE BRITISH DECISION TO POST A                        RESIDENT OFFICER IN GANGTOK IN 1889 AFTER A SERIES OF TIBETAN DEPREDATIONS                        IN THE AREA AS THE OXFORD HISTORY OF INDIA STATES IN TREATING THE AMIR OF                        AFGHANISTANS REFUSAL TO ACCEPT SUCH A RESIDENT IN 1877 IT WAS THE                        GENERAL BELIEF IN THE EAST THAT THE ADVENT OF A BRITISH RESIDENT AT A DURBAR                        COMMONLY FORESHADOWED THE END OF ITS INDEPENDENCE INTERESTINGLY NO BRITISH                        RESIDENT WAS EVER POSTED IN MORE ISOLATED BHUTAN WHICH UNLIKE SIKKIM HAS                        LARGELY RETAINED ITS INDEPENDENCE3 POSTCOLONIAL INDIA APPEARED SATISFIED WITH SIKKIMS STATUS AS A                        PROTECTORATE WITH UNCONTESTED INDIAN CONTROL OF ITS EXTERNAL AFFAIRS AND                        DEFENSE AND BROAD POWERS TO INTERVENE IN DOMESTIC AFFAIRS RELATING TO                        SECURITY UNTIL THE ERUPTION OF THE SINOINDIAN CONFLICT IN THE EARLY                        1950S SINCE THE GOI COULD TAKE WHATEVER                        STEPS IT DEEMED APPROPRIATE FOR INDIAN SECURITY IN THE REGION SIKKIMS                        STATUS AS A PROTECTORATE DID NOT POSE AN IMMEDIATE PROBLEM BUT THE CLASH                        WITH CHINA HAD THE EFFECT OF INJECTING A STRONG DOSE OF REALPOLITIK IN                        INDIAS POLICIES IT ALSO FOCUSED DELHIS ATTENTION ON THE ANOMALIES AND THE                        AMBIGUITIES WHICH EXISTED IN ITS RELATIONS WITH THE HIMALAYAN STATES: THUS                        THE GOI PON DERED THE FACT THAT BECAUSE OF

SIKKIM A SUBSTANTIAL AREA OF AUTONOMY OVER                        ITS INTERNAL AFFAIRS AND LEFT WHOLLY UNDEFINED THE FUTURE DIRECTION OF                        SIKKIMS DEVELOPMENT IN A SOCIETY LESS PREOCCUPIED WITH LEGAL FORMS AND                        MORE CONFIDENT OF ITS OWN FUTURE SUCH LAGUAGE MIGHT HAVE BEEN IGNORED BUT                        WITH THE CHOGYAL DEMONSTRATING AN INTEREST IN

WITH THE POLITICIZATION                        OF THE NEPALESE MAJORITY IN SIKKIM AND A PALPABLE INCREASE IN NEPALESE                        NATIONALISM ON ITS PERIPHERY THE FEELING THAT SIKKIMS

ATTEMPTING TO WORK OUT                            CERTAIN PROBLEMS IN ADVANCE OF CONFERENCE ITSELF WITH RESPECT TO THREE                            SUGGESTED TOPICS FOR DISCUSSION WE CONVEYED FOLLOWING COMMENTS:  1 DISCUSSION OF POSSIBLE DECLARATION WOULD PROBABLY BE MOST USEFUL                             ALBEIT PERHAPS MOST DIFFICULT  TOPIC FOR DISCUSSION HOWEVER US                            COULD MAKE NO COMMITMENT THAT THIS SHOULD BE BASED ON CARACAS                            DECLARATION ECLA REGIONAL SEMINAR ON                            THE INTEGRATION OF WOMEN IN DEVELOPMENT WITH SPECIAL REFERENCE TO                            POPULATION FACTORS SINCE US HAD DIFFICULTIES WITH IT AND WOULD HAVE                            ABSTAINED HAD THERE BEEN A VOTE WE GAVE CASELLES A COPY OF US                            RESERVATIONS ADDRESSED TO ESSENTIALLY PERIPHERAL REFERENCES TO CHARTER                            OF ECONOMIC RIGHTS AND DUTIES OF STATES CERDS DISARMAMENT AND NEOCOLONIALISM AS WELL AS TO                            BASIC THESIS OF DECLARATION THAT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT IS PREREQUISITE                            FOR WOMENS EQUALITY  OUR VIEW BEING THAT PROBLEMS OF WOMENS UNEQUAL                            STATUS ARE FOUND IN COUNTRIES AT ALL STAGES OF ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND                            THAT THEIR SOLUTION IN ANY EVENT CANNOT WAIT UNTIL ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL                            DEVELOPMENT IS ACHIEVED US WOULD THEREFORE FEEL FREE TO DISCUSS                            WHATEVER SORT OF DECLARATION MIGHT BE SUITABLE  2 FURTHER REVIEW OF DRAFT WORLD PLAN OF ACTION WOULD PROBABLY BE MORE                            THAN NEGOTIATING GROUP SHOULD UNDERTAKE IN VIEW OF LENGTHY AND TECHNICAL                            NATURE OF DOCUMENT AND FACT THAT CONSULTATIVE COMMITTEE HAD ALREADY                            REVIEWED AND COMMENTED ON IT  3 US IS UNAWARE OF RESOLUTIONS OTHER COUNTRIES MAY CONTEMPLATE

MEXICO ITSELF HAVE CERTAIN PROPOSALS IN MIND  4 WE ADDED GENERAL COMMENT THAT NEGOTIATING GROUP MIGHT BE ABLE TO                            RESOLVE IN ADVANCE CERTAIN CONTROVERSIAL BUT PERIPHERAL QUESTIONS SUCH                            AS REFERENCES TO CERDS AS US HOPES THAT UNNECESSARY CONTROVERSY OVER                            SUCH ISSUES COULD BE AVOIDED IN CONFERENCE WHERE IT WOULD SERVE NEITHER                            MEXICAN NOR US INTERESTS NOR WOULD IT SERVE THE MAIN INTERESTS OF THE                            CONFERENCE ITSELF WHICH ARE TO DEAL WITH ELIMINATION OF DISCRIMINATION                            AGAINST WOMEN IN ACCORDANCE WITH GA                            RESOLUTION CONVOKING CONFERENCE WE FELT CERTAIN THAT LANGUAGE COULD BE                            ARRIVED AT THAT SHOULD MEET MEXICAN REQUIREMENTS WITHOUT RUNNING COUNTER                            TO THE POSITIONS OF THE US AN CERTAIN OTHER COUNTRIES AS WAS THE CASE                            IN CONSULTATIVE COMMITTEE4 CASELLES SAID HE WOULD REPORT ALL THIS TO HIS GOVERNMENT5 DEPARTMENT HAD EARLIER CONVEYED GIST OF US POSITION AS ABOVE TO                            AUSTRALIAN EMBASSY WHICH HAD INQUIRED ABOUT MEXICAN PROPOSAL WITH                            RESPECT TO AUSTRALIAN CONCERN OVER QUESTION OF MEMBERS OF CONSULTATIVE                            GROUP WHO WERE NOT INVITED WE RESPONDED THAT WE CONSIDERED THIS WAS                            MEXICOS PROBLEM BUT THAT WE DID IN GENERAL FEEL THAT A SMALLER GROUP                            WAS DESIRABLE AND THAT MEXICOS SELECTION WAS REASONABLY REPRESENTATIVE                            AUSTRALIAN EMBASSY LATER HEARD THAT MEXICANS HAD DECIDED TO INCLUDE                            OTHER COUNTRIES THAT MIGHT EXPRESS
