At request MFA PolCouns and PolOff                        handling human rights matters briefed MFA                        Fourth Political American Department on new security assistance                        legislation and potential impact on Iran Discussion went beyond technical                        details to philosophy of new legislation US Congressional attitudes and                        Iranian approaches to human rights problems EmbOffs consistently took line                        that what if anything to do about human rights is GOI decision while Embassy prepared to be helpful to extent                            GOI desires and provides relevant                        information End summary1 At specific invitation of Fourth Political Department head Hatef PolCounsLambrakis and Stempel briefed him and three other                        officers on new provisions of FAA relating                        to human rights reporting and possible cutoffs of military sales Discussion                        dealt both with FAA legislation and more                        philosophical aspects of problem Hatef had read copy of Committee print Human rights in Iran                        which covered Fraser hearings August 3 and September 8 1976See footnote 3 Document                                184 and Document 185 The full                            title of the report is Human Rights in Iran: Hearings                                before the Subcommittee on International Organizations of the                                Committee on International Relations House of Representatives                            Ninetyfourth Congress Second Session August 3 and September 8                            1976 and asked EmbOffs for additional copies Would appreciate                        Department pouching five copies this document2 Meeting opened with review of US legislative reporting requirements                        deadlines and role envisaged for new Coordinator for Human Rights and                        Humanitarian Affairs in State DepartmentJames                            M Wilson was appointed November 17 as the first Coordinator for Human                            Rights and Humanitarian Affairs Hatef inquired if latter would                        have assistants who would travel to countries such as Iran to gather                        information EmbOffs replied it is still too early to know what may develop                        but for the present reports were prepared in the Department on the basis                        mainly of Embassy reporting Hatef asked what Congress could do if State                        Department should report favorably on human rights situation in a country                        such as Iran Would these reports suffice EmbOffs pointed to certification                        option that law provides for Secretary of State as additional input Hatef                        nevertheless expressed concern that Congressmen and staffers might prejudge                        a country and disregard State Department views in favor of inaccurate                        reporting such as Amnesty Internationals or ICJs Hatef pointed to                        multiple inaccuracies in Butler ICJ report along lines Tehran 6119 but more                            comprehensivelyTelegram 6119 was not                            found see Document 184 and footnote 11 thereto Regarding the Butler                            report see footnote 12 Document                            184 and commented that it is sad some Congressmen give                        credence to instant experts rather than official betterresearched                        reporting EmbOffs responded that Congressmen necessarily review vast                        numbers of reports and are themselves used to dealing on the basis of                        information which may not be accurate in every respect but contains                        information which they consider persuasive or at least worth investigating                        However State Department appears to be maintaining its credibility with                        Congressas witness good Congressional reception of Atherton and Habib testimoniesSee footnote 3 Document 185 The text of                                Habibs statement for his                            testimony on the F16 sale to Iran before a Senate Foreign Relations                            Committee subcommittee was transmitted in telegram 229306 to Tehran                            September 16 National Archives RG 59                            Central Foreign Policy Files D7603530445 of which copies had                        been provided to MFA EmbOffs noted human                        rights problem is important and a serious concern but responsible people in                        both governments need not panic Point is new FAA legislation underlines heightened Congressional interest                        and requires more Embassy reporting The more information Embassy can                        provide Washington the better off everybody will be3 Hatef said he personally favored providing maximum information but GOI security officers not similarly inclined                        EmbOffs suggested possibility of trying to distinguish more clearly in                        statistics and public information between those convicted of terrorism and                        those in jail for crimes not involving violence crimes of conscience                        whether these be Marxists or others There then followed discussion of: A                        problems security forces have in dealing with detainees where timely                        interrogation may produce intelligence to blunt forthcoming terrorist                        threats B Iranian use of preventive arrest where evidence suggests person                        or group about to commit crime and C problems posed where professor or                        artist is accused of Communism or of assistance to terrorism and                        incarcerated but no information made available thus giving GOI opponents an open field Hatef said GOI could challenge its detractors such as                        Amnesty International on almost all cases of torture alleged thus far but                        security officials did not want to let outsiders have current addresses of                        these former prisoners citing need to protect their sources and even in                        some cases to protect persons of those released whom Amnesty International                        alleged were still in jail EmbOffs noted this difficulty but also public                        relations risks involved in complete secrecy Hatef agreed4 EmbOffs spoke of cumulative image problem saying organization like                        Amnesty International builds credibility by proving one or two cases in one                        country with effect that its word is more easily accepted on other cases in                        other countries where evidence perhaps not as conclusive It would appear to                        be in Irans own interest to dissociate itself in public mind from such                        other cases Hatef remarked in passing on the difference between Iran today                        and Greece under the recent government of the Colonels he had visited                        latter and felt police rule in the air Iranians today do not have such                        feeling of fear he said5 Hatef was given copy of Ottaway December 12 Washington                            Post article on growing human rights lobby in Washington and in                            EuropeThe article by David B Ottaway is                            entitled The Growing Lobby for Human Rights Discussion                        continued on advantages of open information policy and on utility of GOIs being as forthcoming as possible on                        human rights inquiries EmbOffs noted Iran as sovereign state obviously                        might feel under no obligation to provide information and it is up to                            GOI to weigh political consequences of                        not doing so There are times when prompt explanations might defuse concern                        EmbOffs suggested stressing historical background of human rights problems                        in Iran and speculated personally that stronger presentation of Irans case                        especially by nongovernmental figures would probably be useful in                        improving understanding of Irans circumstances EmbOffs agreed general                        image problem might be exacerbated at times by issues such as oil price rise having nothing directly                        to do with human rights but that efforts to meet human rights criticism on                        casebycase basis would probably help give better picture of Iranian human                        rights situation particularly in context terrorist threats Meeting ended                        with Hatef indicating it had been very useful to him and he expected to                        come back to the question after he has reported to his superiors6 Comment: Importance of meeting lies less in what                        was discussed than in fact Iranians in MFA                        at least seem seriously to be focusing on problem and on US concerns                        Hatef said meeting was at Undersecretary Assars specific instruction                        Hatefs assistants took copious notes Discussion will clearly be reported                        to higher levels of GOI We think these                        talks in relaxed forthcoming manner and at working level are useful both                        for getting US points across in nonconfrontational setting and for                        developing mutual basis for further discussion Hatef and colleagues at no                        time accepted even partial validity of charges against Iran he fished very                        hard for EmbOff judgments but at least                        implicitly agreed with EmbOffs that matter requires better Iranian handling                        Hatef probed what future Congressional attitudes and procedures might be in                        applying new law EmbOffs stressed several times that legislation is new                        and procedures still not worked out beyond steps outlined in FAA7 In process of discussing mutual false impressions Hatef referred to case                        of an Air Force man who went to US or Canada deserted and is now                        claiming he would be tortured or killed if he returned to Iran This is                        patently false Sensing similarity to possible case discussed State 280682                        and Tehran 11813Telegram 280682 to Tehran                            November 15 inquired on behalf of Congress about the likely punishment                            facing the IIAF deserter who claimed                            that he would be tortured or executed National Archives RG 59 Central Foreign Policy Files                            D7604260922 In telegram 11813 from Tehran November 28 the Embassy                            expressed doubt that deserters would face torture or capital punishment                            Ibid D7604410041 EmbOffs asked for and Hatef agreed to                        provide details of case Will report when these provided8 In separate but related matter also indicating increased Iranian interest                        in human rights local English French and Farsi press has over past week                        attacked Amnesty International for parroting same line as French Communist                        journal Humanit on subject of Iranian

    Amnesty International for being tool of international imperialism They                        even allege it is receiving CIA backing and                        contributions Informal translations

frus1969-76v27d199	199 Telegram From the Department of State to the Embassy in Iran	None	1976-12-30 16:34:00	None	None	313328 Subject: SAVAK Activities Ref:                        Tehran 12745In telegram 12745 from Tehran                            December 27 Helms reported that                            at his farewell luncheon Khalatbari conveyed the Shahs comment on alleged                            illegal activity by USbased SAVAK                            officer Mansur Rafizadeh The Shah asserted that SAVAK was not authorized to act counter                            to US law and Iran would reciprocate any action against Rafizadeh                                Helms felt that this was no                            time to have a flareup with Iran since other issues were sufficiently                            testing the special relationship without adding an inflammatory                            public brouhaha over possibly illadvised intelligence activity He                            added we are very beholden here in the intelligence area and therefore                            correspondingly vulnerable National Archives RG 59 Central Foreign Policy Files P840150816 Helms left post on December                        271 FYI: In early November we received FBI                        report that an Iranian national told New Jersey police during their                        investigation of an assault on the Iranian national that he had been                        collecting information on the activities of Iranian students and passing                        this information to individuals who operated the Persian Bazaar and                        Bookstore in Franklin Lakes New Jersey Further police investigation                        revealed that a Mansur Rafizadeh presumably the Mansur Rafizadeh who is                        official at Iranian UN Mission owned the                        bookstore In a later interview with FBI                        the Iranian national denied that he collected intelligence information said                        he had acted as a security person for Rafizadeh during a visit by latter                        to Chicago and now worked as a domestic for Rafizadeh2 Although these FBI reports are ambiguous                        the Secretary believed that Ambassador Zahedi should again be alerted to great sensitivity at this                        time of operations of foreign securityintelligence organizations in the                        United States As you know press and Congressional interest remains high                        Senate and House hearings are likely next year and CBS 60 Minutes is                        planning a program on SAVAKs actions in                        the United States 60 Minutes recently devoted part of its hourly program                        to CIA3 Atherton requested Zahedi to call December 23 and made                        following points: again emphasized necessity for foreign officials not to                        violate US laws or engage in improper activities commented that press and                        Congressional interest has not diminished and it is therefore important to                        avoid even the appearance of improper activities noted that we had received                        an FBI report about Mr Rafizadehs                        ownership of the Persian Bazaar and Bookstore and inconclusive report that                        persons involved in operating this store might be collecting intelligence                            information on Iranian                        students and recalled provisions of the Foreign Agents Registration Act In                        conclusion Atherton emphasized that                        he was not making accusations Rather he said his comments would be kept                        confidential and our strong desire was to avoid any friction which could                        damage our excellent bilateral relations4 Zahedi replied that he was 99                        percent certain he could deny that Rafizadeh was acting improperly but he                        would doublecheck to be certain and let us know Zahedi informed us on December 27 that                        bookstore is owned by Mozaffar Rafizadeh brother of Mansur and an American                        citizen and that no kind of political activity whatsoever was directed from                        the store End FYI5 For Charg: You should inform Minister of Court Alam that PNG action against Rafizadeh has not been raised or considered                        by us However we had received ambiguous FBI reports concerning alleged collection of intelligence data                        about Iranian students by persons apparently associated with Rafizadeh and                        wished to draw this to attention of Iranian Embassy In view of the                        particularly close and mutually beneficial relationship between our two                        countries we want to avoid frictions on such matters and believe that a

Iraq1 Summary: Iraqi regime is frustrated by current                        developments in Arab world and disturbed by increasing terrorism at home                        Despite these problems and increased internal tension with Kurds Iraqi                        Communist Party and Baathi National Command Iraqi regime still seems to be                        in undisputed control End summary2 In aftermath of airport bombingOn December                            15 a bomb exploded inside a suitcase at Baghdad International Airport                            Iraq blamed Syria for the attack The Washington                                Post December 16 1976 p A39 Baghdad remains tense                        as police and security services brace themselves for further terrorism                        Latest apparent outrage was bomb explosion in downtown Baghdad cinema on                        evening of December 23 GOI has not                        publicly acknowledged this latest atrocity but rumors spread rapidly through                        diplomatic corps after loud explosion was heard in downtown Baghdad that                        evening USINT source who has close                        connections with security admitted that explosion had taken place in cinema                        but said that no one had been killed He said GOI would now impose stricter controls on cinemas checking all                        packages as patrons enter and locking doors after showing starts so that no                        one can leave until performances are completed3 Antiregime Iraqis in league with Syrian regime are considered the                        probable perpetrators of the violenceA group                            called Free Iraq claimed responsibility for the bombing Syrian                        Embassy in Baghdad is under particularly heavy surveillance although it                        seems unlikely that Syrians would use their Embassy as a base for covert                        operations under present conditions4 We continue to hear reports of smallgroup insurgent activity in north                        Operations are apparently carried out by Kurdish irregulars supported by                        Damascus USINT Principal Officer was                        denied permission to travel in north during New Years holidays although two                        other USINT officers made similar trip in                        early December5 There are also signs of increased tension between the ruling Baath Party                        and Iraqi Communist Party In reporting on GOI statement attacking Syrian regime for airport bombing                        Communist Party paper Tariq asShab left out one                        paragraph which contained a particularly scurrilous attack on Syrians In response regime                        devoted entire front page of Baath Party weekly newspaper ArRased to an attack on the ICP                        for its alleged failure to support the policies of the Iraqi regime and for                        its habit of taking its cues from foreign powers6 On diplomatic front regime is also taking some well earned lumps with                        expulsion of four Iraqi diplomats from Iraqi Embassy in Amman for complicity                        in terrorist attack on Intercontinental Hotel and with enforced departure of                        Iraqi diplomat from United Nations Mission for illegal arms                            transactionsSee footnote 8 Document 3237 Bankruptcy of Iraqi foreign policy toward Arab world was further                        highlighted last week by announcement of plans for political merger between                        Syria and Egypt Iraqis do not like to play role of odd man out which                        conflicts with their deep seated ideological and emotional inclination

attempts to move in direction of a comprehensive settlement with                        Israel in defiance of Iraqi rejectionist philosophyTelegram 1798 from Baghdad December 7 noted that Iraq                            was increasingly isolated in its advocacy of a rejectionist front toward                            Israel as its onetime Arab partners sought an overall settlement

in this case Saudi Arabia and the UAEThe OPEC conference was held in Doha December                            1517 Although GOI took a                        certain consolation in finding itself at last on the side of the majority                        the decision by Saudi Arabia and UAE to go                        their own way on oil pricing was occasion for some angry words from GOI Iraqi planning officials had counted on                        larger increase to help finance their development plans over next five                        years Shaikh Yamani was a                        particular target of abuse9 To add to their other problems there appears to be some increase in                        tension between the Baathi National Command dominated by Michel Aflak and                        other antiSyrianregime Syrians and the Regional Command controlled by                        Bakr and Saddam Hussein We have                        heard reports that the Regional Command has become increasingly annoyed by                        extent to which National Command has limited their freedom of action by                        taking public positions on sensitive foreign policy issues before the                        Regional Command has had time to act For example the implacable hatred for                        the Syrian regime on the part of the Syrian exiles on the National Command                        has limited the regimes flexibility in managing this bitter conflict10 All in all this is not a merry holiday season for the GOI Outlook is for increasing frustration on                        part of Iraqi regime who have unwisely locked themselves into a number of                        unrealistic policies and who may now feel obliged to opt for more desperate                        measures such as terrorism in a vain attempt to carry them out Terrorism                        will of course breed counterterrorism which will in turn add to the                        regimes already well developed sense of insecurity11 In fact despite recent bombing outrages regime seems to us to be in                        relatively strong position at home Police and security agencies pervade all                        aspects of life in Iraq and Saddam                            Hussein is increasingly taking over the reins of power from                        an ailing President Bakr Acceptability of Hussein to leadership of armed forces continues to be the                        major unresolved succession issue but Hussein is a master manipulator and has had plenty of time                        to establish his own network of informers within the armed forces and move                        his trusted supporters into key commands Although terrorism and covert                        warfare may now intensify we doubt that regime is in serious danger in the                        absence of a successful assassination

reported on his meeting with Kaunda: Meeting with Kaunda marked by very frank                                extended exchanges but with unsatisfactory results from our point of

outlining a proposal                                for the structure of the transitional government that called for                                separating the Council of Ministers from the legislative body                                creating a twotier system National Archives RG 59 Central Foreign Policy                                Files As you will recall not only did I discuss this                            concept with you during my first meetings with you in September but                            there were four preceding missions American and British which had                            already discussed with you the basic structure of the proposed interim                            government While there may have been some questions concerning the                            composition of the interim government especially of the Council of                            State the concept of a sharing of power on the basis of a twotier                            system was never challenged In addition I want to stress that at no                            time was there any suggestion that there should be an immediate transfer                            of power to majority rule This had never been a consideration in our                            discussions and it could not have been because it is not workable or                            acceptableIt is important to remember what the exercise we are engaged in at                            Geneva is all about We are in Geneva to try to reach a settlement that                            transfers power in Rhodesia from the hands of whites who now hold it to                            Africans who rightfully deserve itWe are in Geneva to get a solution that offers the rest assurance of a                            smooth transition to a moderate and responsible government one that can                            bring stability and prosperity to Zimbabwe and one that would not pose                            a threat to the stability of its neighbors most notably ZambiaWe are disturbed by what we perceive to be a growing sense of unreality                            in Geneva not only among some of the nationalist delegations but also                            among the observersSomehow there appears an increasing tendency to ignore some of the                            fundamental realities of the Rhodesian situation:The first of these realities is that Ian                                Smith and the Rhodesia Front hold de facto power in                            Rhodesia not the South Africans not the British and certainly not the                            United States No matter how much we may dislike that situation it is                            not something that can be wished awayThe second there are limitations on the degree of influence that                            external powers can effectively exercise especially for a settlement                            that does not insure minority rightsThe third point concerns those understandings which persuaded Smith to                            accept for the first time in his 12 years in power the principle of                            majority rule and the implementation of that principle within a fixed                            time frame Whatever one chooses to say about the five points of Smiths                            Sept 24 speech and particularly point 3 there can be no disagreement over the fact that they                            were understood to form the basis for negotiationsSee Document 206                            They can be altered in the course of a negotiation but they can not                            simply be discarded in toto Nor can there be any argument over the fact                            that the concept that underlies the five points and that made possible                            Smiths acceptance of themas well as that of his partyis the concept                            that Rhodesian whites would be assured of a meaningful voice and role in                            the political decisions in the transition period that will affect their                            future in Zimbabwe Moreover the five points in concept were discussed                            repeatedly with the front line presidents before they were put                            forwardWe have heard the view expressed by several persons in Geneva that Smith                            and the Rhodesia Front may now be ready to abandon the concept of shared                            power in the interim government in exchange for vague and ambiguous                            promises or understandings We have also heard it said that the United                            States can deliver Smith upon demand and get him to accept any                            alternative set of proposals that might be put forward at the                            conference With regard to the first point nothing Smith has said or                            implied since the opening of the conference offers any suggestion that                            he is prepared to abandon the concept that Rhodesia whites must have                            effective and clearly defined powers within the interim government With                            regard to the second anyone who thinks that we can persuade or coerce                            Smith into accepting a settlement on terms that do not even take account                            of the five points fails to understand the situationOur assessment is that Smith and the Rhodesians are fully prepared to                            fight on and to resist all forms of pressure if they do not get the kind                            of settlement that they feel meets their minimum requirements We are                            especially concerned about the very evident erosion of support in South                            Africa for a settlement which could tie Vorsters hands and prevent him from continuing his                            positive contributions not only with respect to Zimbabwe but also                            NamibiaIf there is no settlement it is not the United States that will suffer                            most directly from the consequences of that failure Those who will                            suffer most will be the Zimbabweans who face the prospect of having a                            whole generation of youth chewed up in needless bloodshed and whose                            only reward will be a country ravaged by war and destructionZambia would pay a heavy price if the war is allowed to drag on and not                            merely in economic terms Zambia already knows what it means to have                            foreign armies living in armed camps on its soil and how difficult it                            can be to control them The Lebanese experience stands as an example to                            all of how disruptive a force these armies can becomeYou must also understand that if continuing violence leads to foreign                            intervention the United States cannot ignore itWe can understand your concern of ZIPA                            and your desire not to provide those who wish to see the conference fail                            with the excuse they are looking for But we fail to comprehend how                            Zambias interests or Zimbabwes either would be served by a solution                            that merely places power in the hands of the militants without imposing                            any discipline or restraint on the exercise of that powerNor do we understand the argument for giving in to ZIPAs demand for instant majority rule                            which seems to us to be contrary to Zambias own interests and which                            will also destroy any chance of getting a settlementTransition means just that not an instantaneous and total reversal of                            existing power relationships but an irreversible movement towards it in                            a limited span of time Obviously Smith will have more power at the                            beginning of the transition than at the endThe United States is committed to a solution that results in the                            effective transfer to the African majority by the end of that already                            agreed interim period For a solution to be acceptable to us it must                            also be a solution that can be supported by the front line presidents                            and sold to the OAU In other words                            Zimbabwes victory is assured and any talk about a second UDI is baseless and absurd We will oppose                            any such move sharply and can count on South African support in this                            regardHowever flawed the institutional arrangements outlined in the five                            points may appear we must remember that they were the basis on which                            Smith was hooked into the process of surrendering his own position and                            powerThe name of the game is to keep him hooked and not make it possible for                            him to wiggle offThere is a lot the British can do to make the structure of the interim                            government function more smoothly and effectively We believe they are                            prepared to play a role and we are prepared to push them in that                            direction But we cannot expect the British to assume responsibilities                            in Rhodesia that they have never had and for which they lack the                            authority to back them up They are willing to bridge the gap but you                            must be very precise and very realistic about what you expect of them                            They can provide the additional margin of assurance for both sides but                            in the final analysis the British role cannot take the place of a basic                            agreement among the parties themselves which defines in clear and                            unambiguous terms the powers that each will exercise in the interim                            periodThroughout the course of our common effort to find a settlement no                            nation has had clearer vision than Zambia No nation has a greater stake in a successful outcome                            one that brings a moderate pragmatic and responsible government to                            Zimbabwe We believe that other nations will recognize and accept the                            fact that Zambia faces greater risks than anyone else if our efforts                            fail and as a result we believe that your word will be needed and                            accepted by the other front line presidents and by African leaders                            generally It is up to Zambia being closest to the problem to remind                            the others of how dangerous the situation can become if a settlement                            based on compromise is not achievedIt is important that the Patriotic Front rethink its position and                            negotiate proposals which provide for power sharing with Rhodesian                            Europeans during the period of transitionThe framework which the Patriotic Front appears to be advancing does not                            meet this criteria and cannot therefore enjoy our supportI apologize for the length of this letter but I consider it important at                            this delicate phase of the negotiations that we analyze carefully and                            fully what is involved I trust that you will use your influence to                            bring the Patriotic Front around to a more realistic approach If you                            succeed you can count on us to work behind the scenes with the other                            partiesI look forward to hearing from you Warmest regards Henry A KissingerKissinger	19761206

from President Nyerere received 10:00 pm local Dec 9:Dear Dr KissingerThank you for so quickly following up on my discussions with Mr                                Reinhardt in your letter of                            7th Decemberand indeed for sending him to Dar es Salaam in the first                            placeUntil early in September I was urging the British Government to do                            nothing until there has been time for the pressures of guerrilla warfare                            and sanctions to deliver Smith to London I persistently argued that                            Smith cannot be begin underline converted end underline he can only be                            begin underline forced end underline to accept majority rule Thus for                            example on 28th August I had two meetings with your emissariesReported in telegrams 3136 and 3138 from Dar                                es Salaam August 28 National Archives RG 59 Central Foreign Policy Files I called                            for the second meeting to make quite sure that they understood that I                            was asking the USA and the UK to do nothing about Rhodesia until                            guerrilla pressures the sanctions and now the declared American policy                            in favour of majority rule had forced Smith to face reality On 29th                            August I argued the same case to the British emissariesBut the British argued that the situation had changed because a new                            factor had emerged That new factor was American power They mapped out                            a scenario which could follow: Smith would fall a caretaker government                            would take over and that caretaker government would announce the                            acceptance of the Callaghan terms                            for a Rhodesia settlementThere was no misunderstanding between us I received a message from you                            dated 1st SeptemberTransmitted in telegram                                216022 to Dar es Salaam August 31 Ibid It included the                            following: You are aware of the framework I propose for a settlement                            It involves A the withdrawal of the present government in favour of a                            black majority government of transition B the drafting of a                            constitution which includes basic protection for minority rights C                            full independence under majority rule in 18 months two years or                            earlier Then on 3rd September I received your responseTelegram 218974 to Dar es Salaam September 3                                transmitted Kissingers                                response National Archives RG 59                                Central Foreign Policy Files P8400840454 to my do                            nothing message It says inter alia I have just received the message                            that you asked be passed to me I have carefully considered the points                            you made and appreciate your reasons for saying that you need more time                            to prepare the ground for a Rhodesian settlement You have asked that                            nothing be undertaken with respect to Rhodesia until conditions are                            rightThat then was my position until early in September I changed I changed                            because and only because of the British and American insistence that the American entry on to the                            Rhodesian scene in support of majority rule provided what was lacking                            beforeie power For America represents power I know this as well as                            Smith does But even when we met on 15th SeptemberSee Document 204                            I was still worried and again expressed my concern about Smiths                            capacity to survive together with his minority rule You reassured me                            with the words yes but he has never been up against the US before                            And you went on to say in effect I do not have your actual words that                            what you had in mind was to get Vorster to get rid of Smith and then the new man would                            accept the Callaghan                            proposalsYou saw Vorster and SmithSee Document                                206 and I became confident that you had pulled it                            off For although you had decided that Smith should himself be forced                            to say that he accepted majority rule it was still obvious from his                            broadcast that he had accepted it only because he had no alternative he                            was confronted with American and Western power So American power was                            being used in support of majority ruleWith this background you will appreciate why I feel slightly irritated to                            find now that Smiths power together with American British and South                            African combined powerlessness is being advanced as the reason why                            the frontline states must ask the nationalists to abandon their                            legitimate demandsFor let me repeat: I changed my approach in early September because I had                            been brought to believe as I have continued to believe until now that                            American power would be brought to bear and maintained as long as                            necessary in support of a transfer of power from the minority in                            Rhodesia This support was limited in action to support for a transfer                            by peaceful means but it was still without question support for a                            definite transfer of power to the majority It has been on that basis                            that my colleagues and I have been acting from September until now But                            after receiving your letter yesterday I am now a little worried that                            this US commitment is being reconsidered I hope I am wrong and that                            such a worry is without foundationWhen we met on 15th SeptemberSee Document 204 and footnote 1                                thereto we were talking in terms of a solution in Rhodesia                            without Smith I specifically said that I liked the American suggestions                            that Smith would be pressured to resign and that an interim government                            would be worked out between the nationalists and a caretaker government                            I was however pessimistic about the chances and you did mention                                Vorsters idea that Smith                            should be the one to announce acceptance of majority rule But whoever                            accepted the Callaghan proposals I stressed that                            the rest of us should keep out once the negotiations had started that                            we cannot deal with the detailsalthough I did add that the Council of                            State you mentioned would not be acceptable to the nationalistsAfter you had seen Vorster and                            Smith you outlined your ideas and what you thought you had                                achievedThey met on September 21 see                                    footnote 3 Document 207                            Frankly I ignored the details I had always insisted that details must                            be left to the conference I certainly did not realise that you were                            committed to a Council of State which would be supreme and to white                            ministers for Defence and Law and Order I thought these matters would                            be the subject of negotiation What I was happy about was your statement                            that Smith had accepted independence on the basis of majority rule in                            two years and a conference to work out the interim government although                            you will remember that I doubted the procedures and said that the                            nationalists could not meet Smith in Rhodesia It seemed to me then that                            Smith had realised that he could not withstand American power on top of                            the other pressures on his regimeSmiths broadcast was a shock to meSee                                    Document 209 But I was                            concerned to save what I regarded as your achievement This is his                            commitment to accepting independence on the basis of majority rule in                            two years and to negotiations about an interim government It was for                            that reason that my colleagues and I urged the British to take over the                            arrangements and to call a conference themselves We accepted Geneva                            rather than London as a compromise we accepted the absence of a British                            minister in the chair as a second compromise For our purpose was and                            is to use that conference to get an interim government that is one                            which would in your own words provide a transition during which the                            whites could adjust to the changes taking place and either be assured of                            their personal safety and wellbeing or withdrawBut as I thought you had understood very early in our discussions there                            could be no question of Smith or the white minority controlling Rhodesia                            during that interim period In my letter to you of 5th OctoberTransmitted in telegram 3718 from Dar es                                Salaam October 6 National Archives RG 59 Central Foreign Policy Files I explained                            again that a transfer of power by easy stages is not possible in 1976                            The nationalists cannot share power with the Rhodesia Front many of                            them have spent ten years in Smiths jails and their friends and                            colleagues have been executed by his illegal regime Too many previous                            attempts to settle this matter peacefully have been manoeuvred by Smith                            into serving the strengthening of his cause The nationalists are very                            suspicious So am I I have been working actively for NIBMARmajority rule before independencesince 1964 and                            have watched Smith outmanoeuvre the British the international                            community and finally myself and my colleagues when each of us in turn                            thought we had got him to agree to a phased transfer of power I warned                            that he would use another conference for the same purpose and there is                            plenty of evidence that he is doing just thatThe nationalists and the frontline states do accept the principle of an                            interim government in which adjustments can be made by individuals                            affected That is why despite our many disagreements with the British                            Government about Rhodesia in the past we are demanding that the British                            Government should participate in the interim government I do know why                            Smith and Vorster have always                            been opposed to British participationeven in a constitutional                            conference They believe that Britain is now committed to NIBMAR But I do not understand your                            own opposition to British participationThe first of our two reasons for insisting upon active British                            involvement is a legal one During the transition period Rhodesia is not                            independent There are certain functions which will belong to Britain as                            the sovereign state Those residual powers are defence external                            affairs and constitutional affairs If Britain does not exercise those                            powers during the interim who would exercise them on her behalfThe second reason is political You had apparently agreed that Defence                            and Law and Order should be under the control of the Smith forces This                            is clearly not acceptable to the nationalistsit could not be But in                            all these matters one must try to find a compromise The possible                            compromise is that Defence but not Law and Order could be held by a                            white minister who is appointed by Britain in consultation with the                            Prime Minister This would be done by the British Resident                            Commissioner But if Britain does not agree to accept responsibility                            for these residual powers how do you compromise on the demand that                            Defence be held by a nationalist without leaving it in the hands of the                            supporters of minority ruleIt is obvious that the person appointed by Britain to be Resident                            Commissioner would have to be someone the nationalists can work with                            it would be no use appointing Patrick Wall or Enoch Powell But I do not understand                            why you say that the British official representative would be chosen                            primarily by the nationalists and dismissed at their will I have never                            heard that suggested by anyone until nowTo avoid continued misunderstanding let me also make it clear that no                            one to my knowledge has suggested that there should be no whites in                            the interim government apart from this British participation of a kind                            that all exBritish colonies are familiar with in the last stages before                            independence As I have said to you before I expectand I know the                            nationalists dothat it will be necessary to be so far racial in the interim government as to                            ensure that there are some white ministers But they will be in a                            minority and they will have to be people who are committed to Zimbabwe                            not to minority rule in that country I am confident that white                            Rhodesians do exist to whom these things are acceptable and who                            recognise that anything else is impossible after the experience of the                            past eleven yearsSo what is the difference between us The conference at Geneva is proving                            even more difficult than I had anticipated But it could still succeed                            provided that full pressure is kept upon Smith and his minority regime                            If however there is still a reality in the possibility of Smith                            getting outside support either from South Africa or from America then                            it will fail Because Smith will make it fail And then there will be no                            other recourse except guerrilla war until the end regardless of the                            effect on the frontline states You ask me whether we can control their                            source of arms They have no choice They will continue to get them from                            the CommunistsWe are committed to independence on the basis of majority rule For the                            sake of a peaceful transfer of power and an end to the horrors and                            political dangers of war the nationalists and the frontline states are                            prepared to accept an interim arrangement even at this date But it has                            to be one which marks a transfer of power from the minority in such a                            way that they can never recover itBelieve me Dr Kissinger I do                            appreciate your desire to see this conference brought to a successful                            conclusion quickly I too get impatient at the way it is dragging on                            But what matters is not the manoeuvring but the ultimate success and I                            think we must be prepared for daytoday frustrations and                            disappointments If it does finally succeed the initiative you took                            will be vindicated If unfortunately it does not succeed and that                            failure cannot be attributed to a withdrawal of pressure on Smith than                            your initiative will still have been a brave and historic attemptLet me now turn briefly to the question of NamibiaHere it may be that we have got into a communications muddle In your                            letter of 4th OctoberTransmitted in                                telegram 246530 to Dar es Salaam October 4 Ibid when you                            said that the Windhoek conference would only send a representative                            delegation to a conference at Geneva you also said that you would take                            no further action until you heard from my colleagues and myself But I                            was under the impression that we had cleared this matter up through my                            discussions with Ambassador Spain and that you were going to ask Dr Waldheim to call a conference which we                            would get SWAPO to attend Now in                            your letter of 7th December you say that this is not good enough                            because of Sam Nujomas preconditions These as I                            understand it are that he should be assured that the people he needs on                            his delegation will be released from South African controlled prisons                            and that he would be negotiating with South Africa as the de facto                            government of Namibia and the UN as the de jure government But there                            is nothing new in this These are the same conditions we talked about                            twice in September So I have to ask what new thing is it that you feel                            is necessary as a result of the problems we have run into at Geneva I                            cannot consider whether there is anything more we can do to help until I                            understand the problem myselfIs the problem still the status of the Windhoek conference people I                            thought we had understood each other on that They are a group of people                            called together by South Africa under South African auspices in a                            territory under de facto South African control Even if you do not                            sayas we dothat they are merely the puppets of South Africa surely                            those other points are incontrovertible I had told you that they could                            go to Geneva as part of the South African delegation I thought that is                            what you meant in your letter of 4th OctoberFor as I said on 21st September it is not for SWAPO to select the South African delegation any more than                            it is acceptable for South Africa to select SWAPOs delegationwhich is why the question of SWAPO people in prison is also relevant                            What is necessary is that the discussion should be between fully                            authorised delegations from A SWAPO and B South Africa under UN auspices The persons                            in each delegation are a matter for the respective authorities to                            decide I am sorry if I seem dense but I cannot see what is so                            difficult about this and why you do not now feel able to ask the UN                            SecretaryGeneral to convene a constitutional conferenceDr Kissinger: Our letters                            inevitably concentrate on difficulties and disagreements because it is                            they which require our thought and perhaps action But I do want to                            emphasize my very great appreciation of the efforts you have made this                            year to get a settlement on the basis of majority rule in Zimbabwe and                            Namibia That there has been movement on the nonmilitary front in                            southern Africa during 1976 is due in very large part to the initiatives                            you have taken and these have demanded a great amount of time and                            travelling and negotiation perhaps not always easy or pleasant on your                            part We do not yet know whether when this vortex of negotiation has                            settled we shall have reached the objective we are dealing with                            questions of longstanding which have become even more difficult as time                            has passed But whatever happens I want to stress that I do appreciate                            your efforts and I do hope that you will not allow any disappointments                            temporary or otherwise to lead to doubt either about the validity of                                this attempt or about the                            cause of majority rule in southern Africa for which we have been                            workingThis letter therefore comes to you with my very warm personal good wishes                            once again I am sure we shall have further contact in the futureafter                            January as well as possibly again before the change in the American                            governmentYours sincerelyJulius                                    NyerereLevin	19761209

with Kissingers point that the US could not ignore                                foreign intervention and said it was not necessary to make the                                point to him Finally he said he would only work to establish the                                mechanics of a constitutional government and that he felt he had a                                sacred trust not to influence things in another country by trying to                                choose its leaders National Archives RG 59 Central Foreign Policy FilesDear Mr SecretaryI have received your letter of 7th December 1976 I must say that this                            was a most surprising letter to say the least I was greatly disturbed                            by the inference and insinuations that appeared to cast doubt on our                            good faith relative to the AngloAmerican proposals on the resolution of                            the conflict in Zimbabwe Your message was couched in terminology which                            is manifestly unacceptableI want to make it quite clear Mr Secretary that threats from whatever                            quarter make no impression on us In a way it was good that this letter came through to us at                            this time because it has revealed that we have after all been working                            at cross purposes in this exerciseIn                                telegram Secto 32060 from London                                to Lusaka December 11 Kissinger attempted to clear up any                                misunderstandings with Kaunda He assured the President that the United States                                was committed to the achievement of majority rule Kissinger expressed hope for                                increased British involvement in the process and for continued                                association and friendship with Kaunda Library of Congress

 1976You mention that the concept of sharing power on the basis of a twotier                            system was never challenged I wish to state with equal frankness and                            unequivocally that neither the words twotier system nor power sharing                            on this basis were ever mentioned at any one time during our                            conversationsFurther your emissaries had assured me and you yourself said later                            that the 5 points which you now refer to were merely talking points                            They could never be considered on a takeit or leave it basis this is                            the impression we gained Frankly this was not our understanding and                            this could not have been the spirit of your message of 31st August and                            26th September 1976For the September 26                                letter see Document 211 However                            I consider that the matters at hand are so grave and the stakes so high                            that I should set out the basis upon which Zambia got involved in the                            present exerciseFirst I want to say that we have always acted in good faith We agreed                            to cooperate in the finding of a peaceful solution even though we were                            already on the road to armed struggle I informed you about this during                            your African tourSee Document 195 Indeed on the 27th of April in                            Lusaka during a luncheon which I gave in your honour I embraced you at                            the end of your speech out of respect for what you had said My embrace                            was not a matter of ceremony but a demonstration of the depth of my                            feelings which grew with every conversation and communication we had on                            the matters at handSecond the conversations which we had with your officials Under                            Secretary Rogers and Ambassador Schaufele on the various occasions left us with the                            clear impression that the Smith government would withdraw in favour of a                            caretaker government which would in turn announce its acceptance of                            majority rule and call for discussions on how to implement majority rule                            with the nationalists Prior to your departure for Pretoria we warned                            you that Smith was a very slippery character who had defeated every                            major effort by successive British governments to find a solution to the                            problem of Zimbabwe We cautioned about any meeting that would give                            respectability to Smith You assured us that you did not come to fail                            and that if we heard that you had met Smith it should be considered good newsSee Document                                205 On your return however we noticed that you                            appeared to have given to Smith certain undertakings which it is clear                            from your letter prompted Smith to accept the AngloAmerican                            proposalsThe third point is that the conversations which we had with your                            emissaries and the clearly encouraging picture which emerged was further                            buttressed by your letter of 31st August 1976The letter was transmitted to Lusaka in telegram                                216314 September 1 National Archives RG 59 Central Foreign Policy Files                                P8400961632 in which you clearly stated:A There would be withdrawal of the present government in favour of a                            black majority transitionB The drafting of a constitution which includes a basic protection for                            minority rights andC Full independence under majority rule in 18 months 2 years or                            earlierThis set against the background of the clear picture we had gained with                            your emissaries earlier about the seriousness of your proposals clearly                            increased credibility that you had chosen a path that was worth our                            supportIt was sincerely on this basis and out of faith in your ability to honour                            your word once you gave it that we agreed to give our cooperation to                            the AngloAmerican proposalsOur confidence was further increased by the reassuring message which you                            sent on the 26th of September 1976 following Smiths broadcast two                            days earlier At this time the presidents of the frontline countries                            were meeting in Lusaka Again when we combined your reassuring statement                            of 26th SeptemberDocument 211 with the scenerio that had emerged                            with your emissaries we were satisfied that there was a clear and                            irrevocable commitment to the road which we believed we were traversing                            together This gave us faith and provided further ground for our maximum                            cooperation Indeed only recently at the opening of the Geneva                            conference the British Chairman Ivor                                Richard in his opening remarks said among other                            thingswe are not concerned with whether there will be majority rule in                            Rhodesia we are concerned with when and how We are not discussing                            whether power will be transferred to the majority we are discussing the                            modality of that transferVery little have we known that there has been a grave misunderstanding                            about the interpretation of the cooperation which we have given all                            along in this exercise until my conversation with Ambassador Reinhardt and now your letter of                            December 7 I must now and equally frankly say that we have ground to believe that we                            were misled We were convinced that we were talking the same language                            when in fact this was not so We have been talking on two different                            wavelengthsIt is not my impression that the nationalists in Geneva are being                            unrealistic In fact their proposals are very reasonable They have                            asked for a unicameral arrangement supported by a British presence which                            together would give confidence to all the races and build a foundation                            in the transitional government upon which people of all races in                            Rhodesia would work together to build peace on the basis of equality We                            are now being told that the nationalists attitude does not provide                            guarantees But there are guaranteed seats for whites in the                            transitional government The reality of the Rhodesian situation itself                            including the judiciary civil service economy and other strategic                            areas in the Zimbabwe society will ensure that the white community will                            continue to have a meaningful voice and protection not only in the                            transitional period but in the period afterwardsWe are being told that ZIPA should                            reconsider its position Frankly we believe that the proposals being put                            forward by the nationalists are realistic What surprises me is that                            when you do not like anything it is being labelled unrealistic Anything                            else that the nationalists offer is unrealistic and ambiguous When you                            assert that you want a moderate and responsible government in Zimbabwe                            and one which would not pose a threat to Zambia I must say that we do                            not need any guidance about what our interests are or what is best for                            us Who are we to choose a government that will govern Zimbabwe This is                            the sacred right of the six million people of that countryIn all frankness I am not yet convinced that we are now being led to                            believe that your present attitude is reminiscent of the past posture of                            successive American administrations on the problems of this area We had                            warned about this a warning which you yourself acknowledged But we                            are now definitely worried that again and in spite of all that has been                            done already the United States may end up backing the wrong horseIf the programme that we believe would guarantee peace and security for                            all is now being labelled unrealistic then we are quite happy to go                            along the path which we had chosen before and that is the path of armed                            struggle We are not unaware of the risks that are involved in the                            struggle But we in Zambia have known no peace and our life has been                            dedicated to serving that which we consider to be right and justWe operate on principles as you know Mr Secretary but I must tell you                            that Zambia will go down fighting on the side of right We would like to                            die as noble men and women This is why I said earlier that threats do                            not impress us We seek a solution that ends the war not halfmeasures                            The global problems in the context of southern Africa demand that a solution that meets the                            legitimate interests of the oppressed people be found and found quickly                            That is the solution that would end the present conflict If now the                            United States Government do not appear to share our conviction in this                            problem they will end by fighting on the wrong side This will not be in                            the interests of the United States and of world peaceLet us therefore not deal with the past there is a problem to be                            resolved at the moment We need a formula that does not insure the place                            of the white community in the transitional government but that which                            provides protection and safety for them for all time in an independent                            Zimbabwe The British Government has now indicated their preparedness to                            establish a presence in the interim government They will need all the                            supportWarm regardsYours sincerelyKaundaPresident of the Republic of ZambiaLow	19761209

of                            Rhodesia Conference: Recommended Briefing Memorandum for the Secretarys                            Meetings in LondonI Rhodesian State of MindA Smiths attitude has improved somewhat since his arrival yesterday and                            it now looks as if he will not pull out of the conference before the                            Secretarys meetings in London this weekend The Secretarys                            instructions for my initial meeting with Smith and subsequent messageTelegram 9789 from Geneva December 9 reported on                                    Wisners meeting with                                Smith National Archives RG 59                                Central Foreign Policy Files seem to have had the desired                            effect and for the moment no further action is necessaryB Smiths sense of having been betrayed both by us and especially the                            British is real He is convinced that the bargain has not been adhered                            to He claims he expected the nationalists would be held to a discussion                            of the five points and he is not prepared at present to see the                            negotiations continue on any other basis Given his perception of the                            British performance to date he will not be easily moved toward                            acceptance of an expanded British role in the interim government as a                            substitute for power being retained in white Rhodesian handsC Nevertheless he has at least indicated a willingness to consider                            alternative proposals and has signalled that he will not for the time                            being strike out on his own or seek a settlement outside the Geneva                            framework He is probing for African support of a nonGeneva settlement                            but cannot realistically hold out real hope in this respect He will be                            looking to the results of the Secretarys meetings in London and                            following this a clear signal from us on what the next steps should                            beII Reactions to Letters to the Front Line PresidentsA The word is now out in Geneva about the Secretarys letters to the                            front line presidentsSee Document 228 Their effect as                            communicated by the observers here has been both shocking and sobering                            The British here share our view that such an approach was needed to halt                            the slide into unreality which had been reflected here in growing                            insistence on the part of both the nationalists and the observers on                            instant majority rule As a result both the nationalists and the                            observers are more aware that we cannot and will not attempt to press                            their extreme demands upon Smith or the South Africans and there may be                            better recognition that a settlement must be based on compromiseB The Secretary will be meeting both Mark Chona and Sonny                                Ramphal in LondonKissinger met with Ramphal on December 11 at

1976January 1977 His meeting with                                Chona will provide an                            opportunity to both soothe ruffled feathers and restate our views of                            what is required to achieve a Rhodesian settlement The Secretary                            should:Reiterate his high regard for President Kaunda and the importance we attach to his sensible and                            constructive roleEmphasize that we wish there to be no misunderstandings between us and                            that none is necessary given the common goal we seekStress our desire to concentrate on the present and future and not the                            pastReemphasize our firm commitment to independence under majority rule in                            ZimbabweSeek Chonas views on what he and                                Kaunda believe is necessary                            to break the deadlockReiterate our conviction that Europeans must have a clearly defined role                            in the transition and that the concept of power sharing must be                            respectedDiscuss with Chona how the                            British might play a role in the interim government and what would be                            required to get the front line presidents to agree to support this                            conceptC While we do not know all that Ramphal intends to discuss on behalf of Obasanjo we know from Nigerian                            observer Anyaoku that he will be outlining a proposal which we assume                            was authored by Anyaoku himself for a repackaging of Geneva based on                            expanded UK involvement If this is the                            case we believe that the Nigerians should also be reminded of realities                            and encouraged to put their weight behind compromiseIII The British RoleA All of the Geneva observers are now convinced that active British                            participation in the interim government is an essential element to any                            successful negotiated outcome While none of them has yet been able to                            specify what that role should be all believe that new settlement                            package based on an expanded British role can be sold to the front line                            presidents who can in turn gain nationalist acceptance The British                            delegation here indicated that their government is now prepared to                            consider responsibilities far greater than any it was prepared to assume                            at the outset The Geneva delegation including Richard indicates it                            expects decisions to be made this weekend in London for consultations                            with the front line presidents and Rhodesians and the South                            AfricansB As previously noted however Smith remains deeply distrustful of the                            British whom he regards as being both weak and indecisive and in league                            with the Africans and is therefore extremely skeptical about British                            involvement in the interim government Therefore we will have to give                            careful thought to how and how much British involvement we might be                            prepared to press upon Smith in order to achieve a settlement in the                            coming daysIV The Recess IssueA A conference recess is inevitable since there is no way that a                            settlement can be achieved by December 20 The Rhodesians would like to                            see an adjournment as soon as possible Richards preference is that the                            conference adjourn as early as December 14 following your meetings in London All including the                            observers and the nationalists agree that the way in which the                            conference adjourns is more important than when It will be essential to                            end the conference on the most positive note possible if there is to be                            any chance of getting the parties back together after the holidays This                            may prove to be the only way out of the current impasse The British in                            particular must be ready to make a major effort in this regard The                            Secretary may wish to press them to develop their ideas on how the                            recess should be engineeredB The Secretary might also press the British to fix a date for                            reconvening the conference The shorter the recess the better otherwise                            energies will dissipate and momentum will be lost We believe that the                            recess should not exceed three to four weeks We will also need to plan                            carefully how the interim is to be used The British have proposed a                            shuttle of their own to consult in various African capitals We should                            hold them to this while giving consideration to how we can complement                            their effortsC Both the nationalists and the observers have raised objections to                            reconvening in Geneva While their objections have not been specific we                            imagine that cost is at least one factor While we suspect that somenot                            all including Sithole and                                Muzorewawould prefer to meet                            in an African capital they can probably be brought to recognize that no                            African site would be acceptable Smith also objects to Geneva because                            he believes it encourages the nationalists temptation to grandstand and                            escalate their demands In the final analysis we believe these                            objections are of little importance if an acceptable basis for                            continuing the negotiations can be found particularly one to which the                            nationalists and the front line states are to some degree committedCatto	19761209

text of joint letter: Dear use                            appropriate title:Recent events lead us to believe that a peaceful settlement of the                            Rhodesian problem is now possible The acceptance of majority rule by                            the Smith regime and the convening of the Geneva conference were major                            steps forward While there are still major problems to overcome we are                            hopeful that agreement on an acceptable settlement can be reachedThere can be no doubt that the alternative to a negotiated settlement is                            increased racial tension leading to further bloodshed A civil war in                            Rhodesia is unlikely to be confined to that country A Rhodesian                            conflict would be a threat to peace and stability in the whole of                            southern AfricaA successful negotiation would open up many opportunities to improve the                            general welfare and economic security of the people of Rhodesia We                            believe that an international economic effort supported by the worlds                            major powers can make a vital contribution to the programs of the                            interim and independent governments of Rhodesia enabling them to                            realize development opportunities and conduct an orderly restructuring                            of the economy Such an effort would be designed to impress both

                        discussions to elaborate this proposal for an international fund It                            would seek to draw together international financial support to assist a                            future Zimbabwe government to promote economic and social development                            expansion of training and employment opportunities for Africans and                            economic security for all sectors of the Rhodesian population We                            enclose a description of the proposed fund with an account of the areas                            in which it would function You will see that paragraph 9 deals with the                            contributions to the fund which will be made by our two governments We                            envisage that any contributions by participating governments would be                            dependent on both the interim and the independent governments of                            Rhodesia accepting responsibility for honoring their international                            financial obligationsWe are approaching a limited number of governments to contribute to the                            important political and economic purposes in mind on a basis taking                            account of historical connections with Africa relative gross national

therefore very much hope that your government will seriously                            consider participating in this fund We are sure that this will greatly                            increase its

Begin text of joint proposal: International                            Economic Support for a Rhodesian Settlement: A ProposalA political settlement in Rhodesia involving first an interim                            government and later an independent government of Zimbabwe would remove                            a source of acute conflict and help establish a climate conducive to                            economic development in central and southern Africa A political                            settlement however will set in motion an economic transition which                            will be most effective if accompanied by measures designed to realize                            the growth potential of the economy and rapidly improve opportunities                            for all the population of Zimbabwe The responsibility for the necessary                            economic measures after independence will rest primarily with the new                            government but it is already evident in spite of the sparse detail at                            present available about the present state and future prospects of the                            economy that substantial international economic assistance and external                            private investment will be needed A brief assessment of the state of                            the Rhodesian economy is at Annex 1When a political settlement is achieved the lifting of sanctions                            combined with aid will provide both Zimbabwe and its neighbors with new                            development prospects Different trade and transport patterns will be                            established African Zimbabweans should have expanded access to better                            jobs in mining industry commerce and the public service More balanced                            patterns of ownership for farms houses and businesses will emerge                            External assistance can help the people of Zimbabwe effect the social                            and economic changes required to take advantage of these new                            opportunities for a more prosperous and balanced economyThe ability of an independent government of Zimbabwe to raise the living                            standards of the poor majority depends not only on the development of                            the traditional sector but also on effective administration and a high                            level of output in the modern sector which accounts for the greater                            part of Rhodesias export earnings internal revenues domestic                            production of consumer goods and wage employment of African                            Zimbabweans It is therefore of the greatest importance to find ways                            to facilitate the economic transition while minimizing its disruptive                            effect on the potential for economic growth It is crucial that skilled                            workers and managerial personnel are encouraged to continue to                            contribute to the welfare and prosperity of the economyThe United States and Great Britain have therefore agreed to cooperate                            in helping to organize an international economic effort in support of a                            Rhodesian settlement They propose the establishment of a Zimbabwe Development Fund The purpose                            of this fund would be to assist the new government to promote:I balanced economic and social development in ZimbabweII rapid expansion of economic opportunities for and skills of the                            African majorityIII basic economic security for all sections of the population so that                            they might continue to contribute their skills and enthusiasm to the                            development of the countryThe different ways in which the fund could assist in these objectives                            are described in more detail in Annex 2 In brief however the fund                            would respond to requests from the Zimbabwe government to support                            specific proposals for development projects and programs for example                            in agricultural and land reform education and training and social and                            economic infrastructure Its efforts should encourage commercial capital                            flows especially in extractive processing and manufacturing                            industries supported as appropriate by national export credit and                            investment insurance agencies The fund should be prepared to provide                            balance of payments support during a period of economic transition                            especially to enable the gradual return to normal external relations                            after the lifting of sanctions The fund could also provide support for                            and take into account the balance of payments implications of programs                            designed to encourage skilled labor and managerial personnel to                            contribute to Zimbabwe development and to effect a smooth transition to                            a more balanced pattern of access to ownership of farms houses and                            businessesThe fund should be established as soon as possible after the                            establishment of an interim government in Rhodesia Even before it began                            to be funded to any considerable extent the fund could begin working                            with developmental institutions either already existing or to be                            established by the Zimbabwe government The fund could assist both the                            interim government and the independent government of Zimbabwe to plan                            development projects and programs consistent with the political changes                            which will have taken place without disruption of the economy The fund                            could in the initial period also coordinate bilateral development                            assistance especially in the training of Africans in technical and                            administrative skillsSince specific development projects and programs for an independent                            Zimbabwe are not yet available a precise quantification of the                            resources needed by the fund is not possible A preliminary assessment                            however suggests that contributions on concessionary terms from those                            governments willing to participate in the fund should be at a minimum                            approaching one billion dollars and at a maximum rather less than one                            and a half billion dollars The funds objectives and the fact that                            experience shows that economic development projects take a long time to mature will make it                            necessary to envisage a fairly long period of disbursement of the funds                            resources It is suggested however in order that the management of the                            fund can plan its operations in the knowledge of the total amount of its                            resources and so that it can meet extraordinary balance of payments                            demands on its resources during an economic transition contributions by                            participating governments should be made over a fiveyear period with                            the likelihood of a longer period of actual disbursement in mindFlows of bilateral concessional aid could it is suggested be counted                            as part of their contribution to the fund but the greater part of each                            countrys contribution at least during the first five years of its                            operation should be direct to the fund On this basis initial finance                            envisaged for the fund might be say twothirds over a fiveyear period                            in cash or in promissory notes and say onethird on call if the                            management of the fund should require it for the fulfillment of its                            longerterm objectives The method by which the contributions were made                            can be discussed between governments and need not necessarily be                            uniform: for example some governments might prefer to contribute cash                            at regular intervals in equal installments Others might prefer to make                            available promissory notes for encashment as disbursements by the fund                            require a method permitted in replenishment of the resources of the                            International Development Association The questions of the currencies                            in which the contributions should be made and the degree and structure                            of any arrangement for tying of procurement in the participating                            countries and provision for the local costs of development projects can                            be the subject of intergovernmental consultation The nature of the                            economic assistance extended by the fund should be such that the                            contributions of participating governments would be expected to qualify                            as official development assistance in accordance with the criteria of                            the Development Assistance CommitteeOn this basis the Government of the United States would subject to the                            authorization and appropriation of funds by the US Congress be                            prepared to contribute 40 percent to the total resources of the fund up                            to a maximum of 520 million the major part a direct contribution to                            the fund and the rest in the form of bilateral assistance and the                            Government of the United Kingdom would be prepared subject to                            Parliamentary approval to contribute 15 percent of the resources                            provided directly to the fund up to a maximum of 75 million pounds and                            in addition to provide 41 million pounds of bilateral aid over a                            fiveyear period The US and British contributions would be                            conditional on each other and on contributions being forthcoming from                            other countries on an equitable basisThe fund will also facilitate action by agencies of donor countries to                            make appropriate nonconcessional loans and guarantees to encourage commercial trade and private                            investment flows to Zimbabwe These would be additional to the                            concessionary contributions discussed aboveVoting arrangements for policy decisions should be related to financial                            contributions but would not necessarily be directly proportional to                            them It is not envisaged that the fund would need a managerial staff of

Begin text of Annex 1: The Zimbabwe                            EconomyZimbabwe is wellendowed with natural resources and despite the dual                            nature of the economy the longrun prospects based upon more balanced                            development and opportunities for all sections of the population are                            good The present state of the Rhodesian economy however is critical                            and the sustaining of the economy in the immediate future together with                            the realization of its potential will require careful economic                            management the formulation of an appropriate national development                            strategy and substantial international development aid to assist in its                            implementationThe population of Rhodesia consists of 6 million Africans and 275000 of                            other racial origin including about 10000 Asians 30000 of Portuguese                            extraction who fled from Mozambique and a significant Greek population                            The separate education system for Africans has effectively limited their                            opportunities at all levels Access to technical education and training                            is particularly limited and the practice of job reservation means a                            marked absence of Africans in skilled and managerial positions in both                            the public and private sectors Many African graduates remain abroad                            The bulk of the African population resides within the tribal trust areas                            although since about 1 million Africans have wage employment in the                            modern sector there is considerable separation of families and a lack                            of adult males in these areasThe Rhodesian economy consists of a large modern sector including                            public administration commercial agriculture basic services mining                            and manufacturing which generates over 80 percent of recorded GNP and provides substantial wage                            employment domestic consumption goods and the principal sources of                            foreign exchange earnings and a traditional largely subsistence                            agricultural sector suffering from considerable land pressure and                            inadequate servicesAssociated with the imposition of sanctions the modern sector has                            undergone some restructuring with greater emphasis on import                            substitution and diversification The share of the manufacturing sector                            in the economy has risen since 1965 and commercial agricultural                            production has been broadened from its previous concentration on tobacco                            to include cattle maize and wheat The volume of mineral production has                            almost doubledDespite the resilience and growth which the Rhodesian economy showed                            until 1974 it has since been seriously affected by sanctions including                            the closure of the Mozambique border in 1976 the world recession                            particularly as it affects South Africa and the escalation of                            violence Detailed data are not available but the proportion of public                            expenditure diverted for defense purposes has increased considerably and                            taking account of loans to the parastatal sector the government has                            sustained an overall budget deficit throughout the 1970sWhile Rhodesia has continued to achieve a net surplus on merchandise                            trade there has been a marked reduction in the volume and value of                            trade in relation to national income The deficit on invisibles has                            worsened in recent years with the loss of revenue to Rhodesia Railways                            from Zambian copper exports since 1973 and with increased trade costs                            for Rhodesian imports and exports which now must be carried exclusively                            through South Africa The current balance has been increasingly in                            deficit since 1972No improvement in factors affecting the current account can be expected                            during 1976 Foreign indebtedness has increased and foreign exchange                            reserves are thought to be low Increasingly stringent import controls                            have been imposed to contain the situation which has not only reduced                            the availability of imported consumer goods but has prevented domestic                            industry from obtaining sufficient supplies of raw materials spares and                            replacement machinery with which to maintain production levels and                            efficient servicesWhile the economy and balance of payments will benefit from the lifting                            of sanctions and restoration of economic relations with the rest of the                            world it should not be assumed that this in itself will produce an                            early and dramatic improvement in the situation The reopening of                            traditional and cheaper trade routes and the ability to buy and sell                            overtly in world markets will benefit the terms of trade although to                            what extent the invisible deficit will be reduced for example by the                            resumption of transit traffic is not clear given the development of new                            communications systems in the region over the last decade It may be                            assumed that manufacturing industry established in recent years will                            continue to be afforded some degree of protection and the manufacturing                            sector should be able to increase exports to neighboring states                            However the demands of the economy for additional imports will be considerable both for the                            reequipment of industry and for public investment In addition the                            structural changes that are likely to take place over the next few years                            could well result in other calls on foreign exchangeIt is evident that a new Zimbabwe government will have serious short                            term problems in trying to avoid a further decline in domestic economic                            activity while at the same time having to face the challenge of                            formulating and implementing a national development strategy to provide                            new opportunities for all sections of the population and ensure a wider                            distribution of the benefits of economic development Considerable                            emphasis will have to be placed on education and training for the                            African majority A major effort will be necessary to develop the                            traditional rural sector and integrate it with the rest of the economy                            this will require inter alia the maintenance of an efficient public                            administration and essential infrastructure services Any failure to                            maintain the production of the modern sector in particular output both                            for domestic consumption and also for export from lands at present                            farmed by Europeans would seriously undermine the economy and an                            independent Zimbabwe governments ability to implement a major economic                            development programThe realization of Zimbabwes economic potential and the future welfare                            of the bulk of the population suggests that there should be no early                            largescale replacement of European skills but rather a deliberate                            change in manpower composition as rapidly as the African majority is                            able to acquire and deploy the necessary skills Land reform following                            the repeal of the Land Tenure Act will necessarily be an important                            feature of a rural development strategy for Zimbabwe A                            welladministered and orderly land transfer program will not only                            facilitate the resettlement of many of those presently confined to the                            tribal trust and African land purchase areas but it will also provide                            the European commercial farming sector with sufficient confidence to                            encourage them to continue farming in Zimbabwe in a manner that will                            maintain production and asset valuesThe absence of a development plan makes the quantification of the likely                            resource gap over the next few years impossible at this stage                            Investment will clearly have to be expanded considerably There will                            probably be some improvement in public sector savings and in the overall                            allocation of resources following a settlement with a reduction in                            defense expenduture Private capital can be relied upon in some sectors                            eg mining and manufacturing and within Zimbabwes debt service                            capacity commercial capital inflows have a role to play While it is                            appreciated that the strength of the economy and its growth potential                            can produce substantial resources for improving the life of all Zimbabweans there is no doubt                            that it will also require substantial concessional aid flows in the                            years aheadEnd text of Annex 1End

   credits or insure private investment and other appropriate                            agenciesDetails of specific programs that the fund might support can be finally                            decided only after much more information has become available and after                            consultations with the Zimbabwe government It may be desirable for the                            fund to support an international assistance mission organized by the                            World Bank and drawing on the capabilities of bilateral aid agencies                            and existing multilateral institutions This mission could assess more                            accurately Zimbabwes economic development prospects and identify                            projects and programs that the fund and the international community                            might support Those program areas of likely interest to the fund                            include:I public administration and institutional developmentII agriculture and land reformIII commerce industry and miningIV education and trainingV social and economic infrastructure andVI international financeSupport by the fund in these areas might be direct support of specific                            projects and programs or it might be indirect through general balance of                            payments support that will enhance the broad capabilities of the                            Zimbabwe government to undertake projects and programsPublic Administration and Institutional DevelopmentPublic and parastatal institutions will have to perform effectively                            during the transition if the significant development opportunities                            outlined in Annex I are to be realized There will be a need to expand                            rapidly job opportunities for African Zimbabweans in the public sector                            Yet much of the existing skilled and managerial personnel may have to be                            retained at least for a while as the demands on an effective                            functioning civil service are likely to expand during a transition                            periodTraining will be a critical element to sound public administration                            While discussed generally in a later section of this Annex training                            requirements for the public service and parastatal organizations will                            probably be a first priority of the new government Institutes of public                            administration organized by a new government and other forms of                            institutional support may merit support from the development fundAnother requirement will probably be to provide job security and                            benefits for those civil servants willing to stay and contribute their                            skills The Zimbabwe government would be expected to honor existing                            arrangements for employee benefits including pensions General support                            provided by the Zimbabwe Development Fund should enable the Zimbabwe                            government to meet the expenses of job security and benefit programs                            associated with a restructuring of the civil serviceAgriculture and Land ReformIn Rhodesia there are parallel modern and traditional agricultural                            sectors The new government will undoubtedly revise the Land Tenure Act                            of 1969 with a view to a more balanced and more economic allocation of                            land while sustaining production in the modern sector and improving                            productivity in the traditionalThe fund might want to support government programs to increase                            productivity in the tribal trust lands and the African purchase areas                            These lands presently constitute about 45 percent of the area in                            Rhodesia They are often dry endowed with poor soils overpopulated                            far from major markets serviced by inadequate transport links and                            farmed without modern techniques Government programs can be envisaged                            to improve farm practice and technologies to expand and invigorate                            extension services organize the distribution of seed fertilizer and                            pesticides improve transport and marketing facilities and intensify                            agricultural researchThe Zimbabwe government will also want to increase the land area farmed                            by Africans The 45 percent of the area now reserved for Europeans is                            much more sparsely settled and not cultivated or grazed as intensively                            as the tribal trust lands This should provide opportunities for                            resettlement A critical problem to be faced by the new government will                            be to enhance opportunities for African farmers to acquire and use land                            in areas formerly reserved for Europeans while at the same time                            production exports and internal revenue derived from the agricultural                            sector are kept resilientThe transition to a new ownership structure of land could take a number                            of different forms For example African farmer opportunities could be                            enhanced through resettlement schemes in which large areas were                            purchased subdivided and reallocated to African farmers Resettlement                            schemes of this sort might be accompanied by infrastructure projects for                            new access roads villages health education and other social services new agricultural                            processing facilities and purchase and production loans for new African                            farmersAnother way for Africans to be given enhanced opportunities is through                            governmentfinanced mortgage schemes in which Africans are given loans                            to purchase farms in areas now reserved for Europeans There may be a                            variety of schemes proposed to effect an orderly process of land                            transfer and the Zimbabwe Development Fund should be prepared to support                            a number of them Projects supported by the fund of course would be                            evaluated in terms of their contribution to economic development and                            would be expected to provide opportunities for existing owners of farm                            assets to sell at fair valuationCommerce Industry and MiningManufacturing mining modern commerce and a range of modern service                            sectors employ over half a million African Zimbabweans and generate over                            80 percent of recorded GNP The growth                            of these sectors is essential to provide employment opportunities and                            increased income potential for AfricansThe Zimbabwe Development Fund might want to support projects for                            training of African managers and technical staff technical advice and                            support services for Africanowned small businesses and loans to                            African individuals to purchase existing business establishmentsA substantial portion of the investment needed in modern industry                            mining and commerce however is likely to be provided by foreign                            private capital The Zimbabwe Development Fund at the request of the                            Zimbabwe government could work with public agencies and private sector                            groups to facilitate the flow of private capital to an independent                            Zimbabwe For example the fund might work closely with the                            International Finance Corporation of the World Bank group and the Berne                            Union Association of Public Agencies that provide export credits                            guarantees and investment insuranceEducation and TrainingHistorically immigration has been the primary source of semiskilled                            and managerial labor Majority rule should bring a large expansion of                            opportunities for African Zimbabweans in skilled and managerial posts                            particularly in the public sector but also in private industry There                            are however many African Zimbabweans with university degrees who                            reside out of the country and who may be expected to return home after a                            settlement Nevertheless lack of skilled labor is viewed by many                            Rhodesians as the primary constraint on rapid economic growth This                            constraint could be intensified as the country moves toward majority                            ruleRedressing the imbalance in the formal educational system is likely to                            be a priority concern of the new Zimbabwe government Support from the Zimbabwe Development Fund                            may be requested to help redress imbalances in pupilteacher ratios and                            in the quality of and facilities for instruction Support may be                            requested for a reorientation of the system to give more emphasis to                            priority areas such as agricultural vocational and technical skills                            trainingInformal training might also be strengthened For example incentives                            for onthejob training and apprentice programs could be supported by                            the government through taxes or direct subsidyThe international community could move rapidly to support programs in                            education and training after the Zimbabwe Development Fund is                            established Initial efforts may have to concentrate on a crash program                            of training in public administration and managementSocial and Economic InfrastructureSocial infrastructure programs are likely to receive considerable                            attention by an independent Zimbabwe government For example there will                            probably be emphasis on expanding health and nutrition programs for                            Africans in both rural and urban areas Community centers and adult                            education facilities may be expandedAnother area of importance will be housing Governmentsponsored                            programs of low cost housing and site and services projects may merit                            support by the Zimbabwe Development FundAs Zimbabwe moves toward independence Embassies will be established                            foreign business firms will seek opportunities for investment and                            technicians and representatives of international agencies may come to                            Zimbabwe This may increase sharply the demand for residential housing                            despite fears of some that housing values would be threatened by a                            transition to majority rule In order to enable Zimbabwe Africans to                            have access on reasonable terms to housing in residential areas now                            exclusively occupied by Europeans and to preserve a stable and orderly                            housing market various government programs may be required This might                            include a facility to provide home mortgages for Africans The facility                            might also provide opportunities for home owners to sell on a basis of                            valuation to be determined during a transition periodThe maintenance and continued development of Rhodesian economic                            infrastructure is vital to the countrys economy and critical to the                            economies of neighboring countries It will be particularly important to                            assess the current structure in terms of the economy after transition                            Previous imbalance may suggest new trunk road development for example                            but will certainly suggest major investment in feeder roads rural                            electrification and village water supplies The requirements associated                            with agricultural settlement will be particularly important and                            immediateWith regard to the transport structure it may be necessary to import                            new supplies of rail and road equipment and spare parts The lifting of                            economic sanctions should allow Zimbabwe to reestablish import and                            export routes now closed in particular through Mozambique to Beira                            Development efforts may be directed at enhancing capacity to use                            theseInternational FinanceDuring the period 1968 to 1974 the Rhodesian economy was remarkably                            strong Real GNP grew at an annual rate                            of 83 percent Inflation was held to under 4 percent per year While                            there has been greater inflation and little or no growth in the last two                            years the growth potential of the economy continues to exist Assuming                            transition to majority rule will bring a reopening of Zimbabwes                            borders without major dislocation a return to a high growth pattern                            seems likely Opening of the borders should stimulate the economy                            through easier and cheaper transportation and the opening of potential                            export markets for her new consumer and intermediate and capital goods                            industriesAlthough domestic saving rates have been exceptional foreign exchange                            availabilities have been limited because of sanctions With the lifting                            of sanctions demands will be made for the input of foreign capital and                            resumption of normal remittances The provision of substantial                            concessional assistance by the fund could assist the Zimbabwe government                            in restoring a more normal international payments and trading regime                            thereby enabling it to take full advantage of the lifting of sanctions                            and the restoration of economic relations with the rest of the world and                            to honor its international financial obligationsThe measures described earlier in this annex should themselves provide a                            large measure of economic improvement and security for the African                            communities It will be no less important for the fund to take into                            account the balance of payments implication of such measures designed by                            the Zimbabwe government to encourage skilled elements of the population                            to remain in an independent Zimbabwe to help to sustain and expand the                            economy In particular the restoration of a more normal international                            payments and trading regime would itself permit the government to                            maintain an appropriate foreign exchange remittance facility Thus the                            experienced farmer or worker who had decided in the light of the                            measures proposed to remain in the country for a number of years should                            be able to do so in the confidence that if he eventually decided to                            depart his savings could be remitted abroad at least over a specified                            periodEnd text of Annex 2End confidentialKissinger	19761217

of the December 1517                            meeting and excerpts from the December 17 Department of State press                            conference were sent to all diplomatic posts in telegram 306331                            December 18 Ibid D7604650702 The White House released a statement                            regarding the price rise on December 17 that begins: We deeply regret                                OPECs decision to raise once                            again the price of oil We very much appreciate the efforts of those                                OPEC members particularly Saudi                            Arabia and the United Arab Emirates whose sense of international                            responsibility and concern for the adverse impact of an oil price                            increase on the world economy led them to advocate restraint and to                            refuse to go along with the increase proposed by the others                            Unfortunately however the majority of OPEC members citing artificial economic justifications and                            ignoring the destructive consequences of their actions chose to take a                            course which can only be termed irresponsible For the full text of the                            statement see Public Papers of the Presidents of the                                United States: Gerald R                                    Ford 197677 p 2873The following is an INR special                        assessment:1 Summary The twotier oil price system which emerged from the Doha OPEC meeting appears to create an unstable                        situation While it evidences the international strains on the cartel                        particularly those between Saudi Arabia and such price hawks as Iran and                        Iraq we do not believe it means that OPEC                        is likely to break up nor necessarily that the Saudis can or will always                        want to dictate moderate increases With economic activity in the West still                        soft and with large stocks on hand it seems likely that the majority of                            OPEC will not be able to impose an                        immediate ten percent price increase especially if Saudi Arabia increases                        production to capacity If the twotier price structure were to be                        maintained it would raise the free worlds oil bill in 1977 by about 13                        billion dollars above that with frozen prices A flat five percent increase                        would add 63 billion dollars on to the free worlds oil bill The twotier                        price structure would also cost the oilimporting LDCs 13 billion dollars                        or 500 million dollars above the 800 million dollars additionally pledged by                            OPEC at Doha Later in the year Saudi                        Arabia might go along with a higher oil price especially if demand for oil                        turns firm and a lower price for Saudi oil would merely mean higher profits                        for the oil companies2 OPECs Split Decision at Doha It was                        generally expected that the December 1517 OPEC Oil Ministers conference in Doha Qatar would cause                        spirited debate but that the differences would be negotiated and compromised To everyones                        surprise a compromise between the Saudis on the one hand and the large                        faction led by Iran on the other hand was not achieved The result is a                        twotier price for OPEC oil The majority                        decision accepted by only 11 of the 13 OPEC states was to increase prices by 15 percent in two                        stagesten percent effective January 1st and another five percent on July                        1st Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates decided to increase their                        prices by only five percent3 The announced prices represented as is OPECs usual practice in terms of marker crude are 1270                        dollars per barrel as of January 1st and 1330 dollars per barrel as of July                        1st for the eleven and 1208 dollars per barrel as of January 1st for Saudi                        Arabia and the UAE There is a strong                        paradox in the elevens use of this practice at Doha since the marker crude                        is Saudi light and the majority could not in fact control the Saudi price                        this time4 The splitprice decision allowed a statement to be issuedThe final press release was transmitted in telegram                            1393 from Doha December 17 National Archives RG 59 Central Foreign Policy Files D7604641147                        and prevented the meeting from ending in even greater disarrayimportant in                        preserving OPEC unitybut it papers over a                        wide gulf Saudi Arabia originally insisted on a sixmonth price freeze                        while Iran Iraq and most of the other countries insisted the increase                        should be at least 15 percent5 Saudi Arabia modified its position only after Oil Minister Yamani flew back for consultation with                        Crown Prince Fahd who was acting as Regent and by phone with King                            Khalid who was in Switzerland                        After Yamanis return the Saudi                        delegation simply stated five percent as its final position and made little                        further attempt to persuade any other delegations to switch over The UAE had already promised to follow the Saudis                        lead on whatever increase they finally proposed6 Iran and most of the other ten countries which finally stuck with them                        were not prepared to settle for less than ten percent for 1977 as a whole                        and there was considerable bitterness about both the Saudis position and                            Yamanis tactics7 In a press conference at the end of the meeting Yamani said:Saudi Arabia would lift all restraints on oil production and let the market                        decide how much it would produceHe expects the West especially the United States to show its                        appreciation for Saudi Arabias oil pricing restraint by helping bring                        about a Middle East peace settlement at Geneva and by conceding something to                            LDC demands in the NorthSouth                        dialogueThe Saudi action does not mean the breakup of OPECThe five percent increase will only take from the oil companies the extra                        profit they have been making recently in the open market because spot prices                        have been above the OPEC marker crude                        price Spot market crude prices are notoriously volatile and and                        unrepresentative of the prices at which nearly all crude moves under                        contract Since spot prices have risen in large part in anticipation of                            OPECs price increase they would                        probably have dropped in the absence of such an increase Had no increase at                        all been voted it is unlikely that the oil companies would have been able                        to reap the extra profit Yamani                        claims8 Other OPEC countries have also                        emphasized that cartel solidarity is not threatened but all express the                        hope that Saudi Arabia will not hurt them by significantly increasing                        production to cut into their market shares Many also warn against games                        by the oil companies to buy at the lower price and sell at the higher                        one9 While consumer countries may be tempted to take comfort from the display                        at Doha of the traditional difficulties which face cartels it would                        certainly be a mistake to assume that OPEC                        is likely to break up or that the Saudis can or will always sharply restrain                        price increases All of the members recognize the benefits they obtain from                        the cartel and none have any interest in seeing it break up However bitter                        they may be they will strive to paper over their differences and present as                        solid a front to the world as before10 The situation which emerged from Doha however seems clearly unstable                        and it appears highly unlikely that the dual oil price system can be                        sustained for long Saudi Arabia seems serious in its intent to increase                        production as called for to bring the OPEC                        price down to its five percent increase It probably will not be able to                        bring enough production on stream fast enough to limit the overall price                        increase to five percent but with economic activity in the West soft and                        large stocks on hand it should be able to compel substantial shaving from                        the ten percent increase adopted by the remaining OPEC countries if it follows through on its stated intention                        to do so11 Saudi Arabia is estimated to have excess producing capacity of two to                        three million barrels per day at present and can easily push up production                        by at least one million BD in a matter of                        days and by more in a matter of months Thus failure to meet Saudi prices                        could mean a substantial loss in market shares for the eleven and once any                        price reduction takes place in one or more countries other countries would                        find holding out progressively more difficult12 There are certain contractual agreements which the companies have with                        various members of the eleven and these members can be expected to apply as                        much pressure on the companies as possible to keep up their liftings on pain                        of loss of future access On the other hand many of these countries have been the regular                        discounters in the past and there are indications some particularly                        Indonesia probably will not even try to implement the full ten percent to                        begin with13 It is therefore probable that the eleven will have to moderate their                        announced higher increases although they will use various devices such as                        manipulation of differentials extending longer credits etc to put a fig                        leaf on their actions and avoid any formal declaration14 The next regularly scheduled meeting of OPEC Ministers was set at the Doha meeting for July 12 1977                        but there is nothing to prevent them from calling a special meeting at any                        time There will certainly be pressure for an early meeting to work out                        their differences and reach a compromise single price15 If the twotier structure were to be maintained and the percentages                        produced by the two group of OPEC                        countries were to remain the same as they have been recently the effective                        increase for the first half of 1977 would be 83 percent for the last half                        116 percent and the average for 1977 around ten percent If the                        percentages received from each group of OPEC countries by each of the consuming countries were to                        remain the same as they have been recently as shown below and if demand                        grows at current rates the impact on the major industrialized countries                        would be as follows:Recent Percent of OPEC                            ImportsCountryFrom Saudi Arabia and UAEFrom Other OPECProjected Increase in Oil Bill billion

in oil import bills over what                        they would be with the price of oil frozen is estimated at 127 billion                        dollars if the twotier price is maintained as against 63 billion dollars                        for an acrosstheboard five percent increase16 The Oil Ministers also decided unanimously at Doha to increase OPECs assistance to oilimporting developing                        countries by 800 million dollars citing their desire to enhance solidarity                        with other LDCs and their efforts to attain a new international economic                        order The 800 million dollars only represents around six percent of the                        additional revenues OPEC nations can                        expect from the price increase Furthermore if the oilimporting LDCs were                        to find themselves paying the world average for their oil imports and if                        their demand grows at recent rates their oil bill will increase by about                        13 billion dollars 05 billion dollars or 625 percent more than the                        additional aid voted them by OPEC17 While it is difficult to say exactly what the situation will be in six                        months from now the Saudis may decide or feel forced to go along with a                        larger increase by that time If the Western economies rebound strongly and                        the demand for oil becomes very strong they may decide that the market                        calls for an increase and that if they dont take the profit the oil                        companies will Further moderation on their part may be forthcoming for                        political reasons however if they feel good progress is being made toward                        a Middle East peace settlementRobinson	19761222

L STEARMAN WLS initialedSUBJECT: US Military Presence in ThailandAt Tab A is a draft State cable instructing Embassy Bangkok to respond to                            recent increasing Thai Government RTG pressures for a reduced US                            military presence after the Cambodia bombing halt August 15 by                            undertaking a dialogue with the RTG on this questionSince the August 15 Congressional moratorium on bombing in Cambodia was                            passed the RTG has made increasingly clear to us both publicly and                            privately that they want a reduction in our military presence in                            Thailand to follow the bombing halt About two weeks ago a highlevel RTG Foreign Ministry official told our                            Charge that the RTG while not wanting to eliminate the US military                            presence did want to regularize it and as soon as possible to                            reduce it On July 11 the Deputy Foreign Minister stated RTG policy on this point:                            Should there be a cessation of bombing the strength of American                            military forces would have to be reduced On July 18 the RTG formally asked for our response to three questions                            Bangkok 11025 at Tab B: What are US intentions regarding Cambodia after August 15 What are US intentions regarding future use of air bases in                            Thailand What are US plans for reequipping Thai armed forces This                            development occurred after the State draft cable came to us for                            clearance State is preparing a separate reply to the first and third                            questions but believes strongly that a reply on our military presence                            in Thailand should not be delayed We agree The RTG has not been specific as to the size timing or rate of a                            reduction in our military presence noting only that it should be                            orderly and gradualRTG motivation for the requested reduction probably centers on: The need to dampen domestic political criticism which has been on the                            increase since early this year Our continued sizeable military presence                            in the face of the Vietnam settlement has provided one issue that former                            officials such as Thanat and students have seized on to attack the                            government Our military presence as one factor in the current RTG reassessment of                            Thai foreign policy in the light of the Indochina settlement US                            Congressional restrictions on our military efforts there and military                            assistance generally and Thai efforts to normalize relations with                            Peking and Hanoi A continued RTG effort to extract a higher price for our military                            presence particularly in the face of decreasing US military                            assistanceThe draft State cable instructs Ambassador Unger to initiate a dialogue                            with the RTG on a possible reduction in our military presence after                            August 15 to avoid having the RTG levy specific demands for a reduction                            on us He is cautioned that we must not give Hanoi indications subject                            to misinterpretation The specific points to be made to the RTG are: The USG is presently reviewing the level of our military presence in                            Thailand not wanting to maintain a level in excess of that required by                            our common interests In light of changing security conditions in the area we are                            tentatively considering the removal from Thailand of a few units for                            reasons of economy and efficiency but do not want to do so in a way                            that will be misinterpreted by Hanoi We have made a minor change in                            the wording of States draft on this point to remove the implication                            that we now have units in Thailand that are of questionable marginal                            military value We have not yet decided on more substantial future reductions but                            contemplate these as soon as security conditions in the area permit We                            do however want to retain a sufficient capability to respond to                            foreseeable contingencies Looking toward the

basing arrangement in ThailandThe State draft is acceptable except that it does not emphasize strongly                            enough that the maintenance of a US military presence is in Thailands                            security interest as well as that of the US The Thai have a tendency                            to downplay their own interest in our military presence probably in

FOREORDAINED IN THE SENSE THAT                            DEMOCRATIC GOVERNMENT OF THAILAND STANDS OUT AS A BREAK IN THE PATTERN                            OF AUTOCRATIC OR OLIGARCHIC RULE WHICH HAS

ABOUT THREE YEARS OF                            DEMOCRATIC GOVERNMENT MOST OF IT SINCE OCTOBER 19732 BACKGROUND: THE THREE CABINETS THAT SPANNED THE THAI DEMOCRATIC

IMAGINATIVE AND STRONG LEADERSHIP WHICH THAILAND REQUIRES IN THE                            PRESENT PERIOD IN SEVERAL RESPECTS THE TWO CABINETS OF PRIME MINISTER                            SANYA THAMMASAK OCT 1973 TO MARCH 1975 WERE PROBABLY THE MOST                            MEMORABLE IN THE SENSE THAT SANYA PRESIDED SUCCESSFULLY OVER THE                            TRANSITION FROM AUTHORITARIAN TO DEMOCRATIC GOVERNMENT SANYAS ROLE HAD                            TO BE A TEMPORARY ONE HOWEVER AS HE WAS APPOINTED DIRECTLY BY THE                            KING HAD NO SPECIFIC POLITICAL BASE AND HAD A FUNCTION LIMITED TO                            SETTING OUT THE FOUNDATIONS OF FUTURE DEMOCRATIC GOVERNMENT THE CABINET                            OR PRIME MINISTER KHUKRIT

CABINET OF PRIME MINISTER SENI                            PRAMOT APRIL 21 1976 TO OCTOBER 6 1976 IN SEVERAL WAYS APPEARED TO                            HAVE THE MOST PROMISE AS IT WAS A COALITION CONSISTING OF ONLY FOUR                            PARTIES WITH A HUGE MAJORITY IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES THERE WAS                            LITTLE OVERT FRICTION BETWEEN THE FOUR PARTIES BUT THERE WAS DISASTROUS                            DISAGREEMENT BETWEEN FACTIONS WITHIN THE DEMOCRAT PARTY PARTICULARLY                            OVER THE HANDLING OF THE RETURN OF FORMER PRIME MINISTER

   ONLY OF ACADEMIC INTEREST NOW BUT IT MAY BE WORTHWHILE TO MAKE A FEW                            POINTS IN THIS CONNECTION THERE WERE SEVERAL INDICATIONS OF COUP                            PLOTTING DURING THE PAST YEAR THE ROYAL THAI ARMED FORCES PROBABLY HAD                            THE CAPABILITY TO MOUNT AND EXECUTE A SUCCESSFUL COUP THROUGHOUT THIS                            PERIOD HOWEVER IT WAS NOT UNTIL LAST WEEK THAT THE ELEMENTS ESSENTIAL                            TO A FINAL DECISION WERE BROUGHT TOGETHER SUCH A TAKEOVER PROBABLY CAME                            CLOSE TO OCCURRING

THIS                            PLOT THEORY IN SOME VERSIONS EVEN ALLEGES THAT THE MOCK HANGING                            EPISODE AT THAMMASAT UNIVERSITY ON OCT 4 INVOLVING A STUDENT WHO                            RESEMBLED THE CROWN PRINCE WAS ARRANGED BY THE COUP PLOTTERS TO BRING                            ON DISORDERS AND SO PROVIDE AN EXCUSE FOR THE MILITARY TAKEOVER A                            PLOT THEME WITHOUT SPECIFIC DETAIL IS PLAYED IN THE COMMENTARIES ON                            THE MILITARY TAKEOVER IN RADIO BROADCASTS FROM MOSCOW VIENTIANE AND                            HANOI5 BEYOND A CLOSENESS IN TIMING THERE IS NO EVIDENCE FOR ANY OF THIS                            THOUGH THANOM MAY BE PERMITTED TO REMAIN IN THAILAND HE IS NOT ON                            PARTICULARLY GOOD TERMS WITH ADMIRAL SANGAT AND OTHER MILITARY LEADERS                            AND MOST THAI MILITARY FIGURES NOW APPEAR TO FEEL THAT THANOMS TIME IS                            PAST IN ANY CASE THANOMS RETURN RELEASED TENSIONS WHICH LED INITIALLY                            TO THE RESIGNATION OF PRIME MINISTER SENI ON SEPT 23 AND TO THE DECISION                            BY SENI ON OCT 5 TO SEND POLICE INTO THAMMASAT U CAMPUS TO ARREST SOME                            OF THE STUDENTS HOWEVER THANOMS RETURN DID NOT RPT NOT PROVIDE THE                            PRIMARY MOTIVE FORCE TO THE EVENTS OF LAST WEEK THE MILITARY LEADERS                            MAY HAVE USED A LONGPREPARED CONTINGENCY PLAN IN STAGING THE COUP BUT                            THIS APPEARS TO HAVE BEEN THE MOST THAT WAS DONE IN ADVANCE THE COUP                            ITSELF APPEARS TO HAVE BEEN DECIDED ON IN REACTION TO THE EVENTS OF OCT                            66 WHILE THE DECISION TO STAGE THE COUP WAS MADE BY THE MILITARY LEADERS                            THEMSELVES IT IS A SAD COMMENTARY ON THE DEMOCRATIC EXPERIMENT TO NOTE                            THEY DID NOT RPT NOT TAKE OVER FROM A

MUST LIE WITH THE                            LEADERSHIP OF THE NATIONAL STUDENT CENTER OF THAILAND NSCT AND WITH                            THE PROGRESSIVE FACTION OF THE DEMOCRAT PARTY THE STUDENT

GOVERNMENT WITH THE KING AS                            HEAD OF STATE AND WILL DO EVERYTHING IT CAN TO GIVE FIRM FOUNDATIONS TO                            THIS SYSTEM OF GOVERNMENT BY STAGES UNTIL WE HAVE A DEMOCRATIC                            GOVERNMENT WITH THE KING AS HEAD OF STATE THAT IS APPROPRIATE TO THE                            PRESENT CIRCUMSTANCES SUCH A STATEMENT MAY BE REGARDED AS CYNICAL                            LIPSERVICE BUT ITS INCLUSION IN THE INITIAL MANIFESTO AT LEAST                            INDICATES AN AWARENESS ON THE PART OF THE NARC THAT THERE IS A                            CONSIDERABLE ATTACHMENT IN THAILAND TO THE CONCEPT OF DEMOCRATIC                            GOVERNMENT8 THE APPOINTMENT OF THANIN KRAIWICHIAN AS PRIME MINISTER ON OCT 8 THE                            ANNOUNCEMENT THAT A FULL CABINET WILL BE APPOINTED WITHIN TWO WEEKS AND                            THE APPOINTMENT OF A CONSTITUTION DRAFTING COMMITTEE ON OCT 11 INDICATES                            THAT THE NARC APPRECIATES THAT IT CANNOT GOVERN THE COUNTRY DIRECTLY AND                            THAT A NORMAL STRUCTURE OF GOVERNMENT NEEDS TO BE COMPLETED QUICKLY                            HOWEVER THANINS SPEECH OF OCT 13 REFTEL INDICATES THAT CONSIDERABLE                            EXPERIMENTATION IN GOVERNMENTAL STRUCTURES LIES AHEAD9 AS FOR THE 24MEMBER NARC ITSELF IT PROBABLY CANNOT CONTINUE IN ITS                            PRESENT FORM INDEFINITELY IT IS TOO LARGE TO FUNCTION EFFECTIVELY AND                            SEVERAL OF ITS MEMBERS PARTICULARLY THE COMMANDERS OF THE FIELD ARMIES                            WHOSE HEADQUARTERS ARE OUTSIDE OF BANGKOK WILL PROBABLY ATTEND ITS                            SESSIONS ONLY FROM TIME TO TIME THE NARC LACKS A SINGLE STRONG LEADER                            THE CHAIRMAN ADMIRAL SANGAT IS WELLRESPECTED IN THE THAI ARMED                            FORCES BUT HIS CAREER SERVICE IN THE NAVE IS AN ANOMALY IN A MILITARY                            GOVERNMENT TRADITIONALLY DOMINATED BY THE MUCH LARGER ROYAL THAI ARMY                            THERE ARE INDICATIONS THAT IF THE COUP OF OCT 6 HAD BEEN DELAYED                            ANOTHER COUPLE OF DAYS THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN A DIFFERENT COUP WITH A                            DIFFERENT SET OF LEADERS AMONG WHOM THE THAI ARMY WOULD HAVE                            PREDOMINATED THE ABRUPT DISMISSAL OF GENERAL CHALAT ON OCTOBER 10                            UNDER CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH INDICATE HE WAS ENGAGED IN COUP PLOTTING AND                            THE SUDDEN DISPATCH OF LTG WITHUN YASAWAT TO JAPAN ON OCT 13 TO                            SUPERVISE THAI STUDENTS IN THAT COUNTRY SIMPLY UNDERLINE THE CONCERN                            OF THE NARC

197711 AT THIS POINT IT IS EASIER TO ASK QUESTIONS THAN TO PROVIDE ANSWERS                            ON THE WHOLE WE BELIEVE THAT A PERIOD OF SOME INSTABILITY AND CONFUSION                            LIES AHEAD UNTIL THE LEADERSHIP OF THE GOVERNMENT DOMINATED BY THE                            MILITARY SETTLES DOWN GIVEN THE BACKGROUND AND EXPERIENCE OF THE                            FIGURES IN THE NARC IT IS QUESTIONABLE THAT THE NARC AS PRESENTLY                            CONSTITUTED CAN PROVIDE THE LEADERSHIP THAT THAILAND NEEDS IN THE PERIOD                            AHEAD
