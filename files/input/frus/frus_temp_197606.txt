for AmbHelms from Habib Subject: New Development in Barzani                        Visit1 less than 1 line not declassified following                        several feelers Barzani has now made formal request for a meeting with                        State Department officialsAccording to a June                            29 memorandum from Atherton to                                Habib Barzani requested a                            meeting with Department officials after his arrival in the United States                            for medical treatment Ibid P8301620935 Request did not                        include names of specific persons in the Department nor did it indicate                        reason for talk Impression less than 1 line not                            declassified is that Barzani has now decided he wants to stay in                        the US and that this would be subject of any discussions with Department                        Meanwhile SAVAK escort has instructions                        to return Barzani to Iran within a month2 We understand that there has been a total remission of original cancer and                        no evidence of second tumor Barzani should be through at Mayo Clinic by                        Monday June 28 following examination there of son Sahad who is reportedly                        suffering from extreme overweight less than 1 line not                            declassified plans to escort party for approximately one weeks                        sightseeing3 Having a State Department official meet with Barzani presents obvious                        problems with respect to relations with Iraq and to some extent with Iran                        although these may be ameliorated if the contact is not at too senior a                        level Against these factors we must weigh the fact of previous meeting                            Sisco last fallSee footnote 4 Document                                301 and possible public and Congressional perceptions                        eg Barzani may already have made his presence in the US known to such                        earlier contacts as Senator Kennedy                        Justice Douglas and George Meany                        On balance therefore we have tentatively concluded that an unpublicized                        discreet appropriatelevel contact within NEA would be logical and reasonable4 Whether to allow Barzani to remain in the US if that is in fact his                        desire presents a more sensitive question In the US he would                        undoubtedly be involved directly or indirectly in propaganda                        activitiesparticularly against Iraqwhich could complicate our relations                            with both Iraq and Iran Iraq                        which has already formally protested Kurdish refugee emigration to the US                        from Iran would certainly find even more objectionable our providing a                        haven for Barzani AntiIraqi activities by Barzani in the US could also                        be embarrassing to the Iranians in their rapprochement efforts with the                        Iraqis At the same time refusing to let Barzani remain in the US could                        produce criticism in the press and on the Hill5 If Barzani meets with Department official and raises this question we                        plan to discourage him from remaining in the US although there may be a                        problem if he for example decided to apply formally to stay and made the                        fact public We will plan to keep the Iranians closely informed of the                        developing situation and seek their views We would plan to take no                        initiative in informing Iraqis of the situation6 Embassy London: Please inform Ambassador Helms of foregoing and seek his views7 Tehran for Charg Miklos Baghdad                        for Wiley: Would also appreciate your views and suggestions but of course                        without going to host government officials at this timeThe Interests Section responded in telegram 903 from                            Baghdad July 4 that a Barzani visit to the Department at the Country                            Director level was unlikely to disturb USIraqi relations If Barzani                            were to remain in the United States permanently however the Iraqis                            could react strongly given their suspicions of USSyrian                            collaboration in aid to Kurdish dissident activity in Iraq National                            Archives RG

COORDINATION OF MILITARY ASSISTANCE HE NOTED THAT ZAIRE WAS                            RECEIVING HELP FROM A NUMBER OF SOURCES AND ASKED WHAT ARRANGEMENTS                            EXISTED FOR COORDINATING THIS ASSISTANCE TO ACHIEVE MAXIMUM RATIONAL                            RESULTS MOBUTU SAID THIS wAS                            ANOTHER AREA OF INTEREST TO HIM AND HE RECALLED BOTH FOREIGN MINISTER                            NGUZAS EFFORTS LAST FEBRUARY TO ENLIST EUROPEAN INTEREST IN A COMMON                            EFFORT AND SECRETARY KISSINGERS                            AGREEMENT

INVOLVEMENT TO ECONOMIC ASSISTANCE SECRETARY RUMSFELD SAID HE HAD                            DISCUSSED ZAIRES NEEDS WITH THE BELGIANS ONLY A FEW DAYS BEFORE IN                            BRUSSELS HE SAID THAT WHEN HE RETURNED TO WASHINGTON HE WOULD DISCUSS                            FURTHER THE MATTER OF A COORDINATED EFFORT WITH SECRETARY KISSINGER9 PURSUING THE QUESTION OF FOREIGN ASSISTANCE MOBUTU SAID HE COULD NOT UNDERSTAND                            WHY CERTAIN POLITICALLY WELLORIENTED COUNTRIES NOTABLY CERTAIN                            OILPRODUCING STATES IN THE MIDDLE EAST SEEMED

SATISFACTION THAT SECRETARY RUMSFELD HAD TAKEN THE TIME TO TRAVEL PERSONALLY TO                            ZAIRE THAT HIS VISIT COULD NOT BUT bE INTERPRETED AS AN ENCOURAGING

Daoud and                            Prime Minister Bhutto have                            overcome significant obstacles to achieve genuine personal rapport                            Their June 1976 summit meetings in Kabul have resulted in setting up a                            continuing dialogue at in continuing the halt to the propaganda each                            country had directed against the other Much can happen to derail this                            effort and next steps may be slow in coming but a start has been made                            It has been demonstrated at least in the short run that opposition                            from the Afghan Left and the Pushtun ethnics to Daouds softening his line on                            Pushtunistan is manageable Daouds gesture in inviting Bhutto makes it unlikely the issue can ever be viewed in Afghanistan in quite the same                            way as in the past Regional stability has been enhanced a state of                            affairs the US can applaud End Summary2 One week after Prime Minister Bhuttos departure from Kabul talks we have had with a                            number of influential Afghans in and out of government convince us that                            the ice has been broken in AfghanPakistan relations The DaoudBhutto Summit made possible by the statesmanship of                            both leaders signals the beginning of a welcome warming trend in                            bilateral affairs contributing to regional stability3 Two key concessions probably made the summit possible: the Paks were                            willing publicly to recognize that there is a political difference                            the Pushtunistan issue which has been a centerpiece of Afghan foreign                            policy for generations the Afghans ie Daoud were willing to have                            high level bilateral discussions without bringing up the subject of the                            fate of the Pushtun nationalist Wali Khan and his now banned National                            Awami Party NAP in Pakistan which the Paks consider to be internal                            matters4 Head of State and Prime                            Minister Daoud and Prime Minister                                Bhutto can be credited with                            three main achievements resulting from the June 711 1976 Summit                            talks:First: The two men established what appears to be genuine personal                            rapport overcoming preconceived negative impressions each had had of                            the otherSecond: Daoud has agreed to visit                            Pakistan to continue the bilateral dialogue Such a trip was earlier                            literally unthinkableThird: Both sides have agreed to halt hostile propaganda  directed                            principally to the ethnic minorities in each country  which had been                            for so long the scurrilous background for official relations5 So a good beginning has been made and we regard this AfghanPak thaw                            contributing as it does to regional stability as definitely in the US                            interest There also may ensue economic opportunities for the US                            should PakAfghan relations subsequently permit work on joint projects                            for example the exploitation of the rich Hajikak iron deposits Iranian                            interest in improving the Afghan Pak relationship has been and will be                            important to continuing positive results6 We believe the Russians and their local adherents are somewhat off                            balance after the Summit We have reports of factional bickering in                            leftist circles over whether abandonment of Pushtunistan by Daoud                            constitutes betrayal of the 1973 revolution The domestic left is off                            balance and we think Soviet interests are off balance too at least as                            they are perceived here by Soviet Embassy officials7 The thaw though begun is hardly begun Many things could occur to                            derail this promising beginning: a change of leaders a terrorist                            incident a personal misunderstanding between high level persons on                            either side We intend to continue stressing the importance the US                            attaches to continuation and broadening of bilateral diplomacy without                            outside interference8 What happens next and when remains to be seen Presumably the Afghans                            will appoint an Ambassador to Islamabad before Daoud goes there There are some reports                            that Daoud will travel soon but                            it is hard to see how this can be before late July at the earliest as he                            has Mrs Gandhi coming July 47                            the Indonesian Foreign Minister on July 11 and his own national day                            celebrations July 1719 We tend to think that concrete steps that ensue                            on both sides will take place                            with minimal fanfare as befits the sober serious lowkey atmosphere to                            date of this fragile rapprochement9 One thing we believe certain: after being adamant all his life on the                            issue of Pushtunistan Daoud has                            given a clear signal of change of heart We believe it improbable this                            issue can ever again be viewed in Afghanistan in quite the same wayELIOT	19760619
