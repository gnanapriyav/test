Assessment of Iraq and Policy Recommendations1 Summary: On eve of ArabIsraeli war Iraqi regime                        was estranged from most Arabs and Iran engaged in bitter intraparty                        struggle for power faced with possible new war against Kurds and involved                        in marriage of convenience with Communist Party which Communists skillfully

causes of instability At most regime has gained time to deal                        with problems Despite antiUS stand there is still hope for US End summary2 War was godsend for Baath regime and it acted swiftly to exploit it It                        contributed two divisions and five Air Force squadrons but kept best weapons                        at home Indian MilAtt says two brigades

shown no inclination to compromise and is attacking ICP for its role in National Front5 ICP also exploited war for its own                        purposes In midst of war Central Committee issued

Only for the Secretary from the                        Ambassador1 Khalatbari called me to Foreign                        Ministry morning November 18 to read me message from Iranian Ambassador in                        Cairo about his meeting with President Sadat at 1300 on November 16 pursuant                        to instructions from the Shah There was no explanation as to why Shah                        communicated with Sadat by telegram rather than sending emissary as he did                        in case of King Faisal Shahs                        telegram to Sadat was dispatched on                        November 11 but due to pressures Sadat did not receive Iranian Ambassador until November                        162 Shahs message to Sadat contained                        usual congratulatory amenities mentioned that you had informed Shah of your                        talks with Sadat expressed hope for                        continuing success of ceasefire arrangements Shah pointed out that policy                        of Arab countries to use oil weapon had produced results and had contributed                        to opening eyes of oil consuming nations to Arab cause If this policy were                        to be continued now that fighting had stopped however and if oil consuming                        nations were to be subjected to economic pressure this could in America                        Europe and Japan give to Jewish lobby and those who are opposed to Arabs                        opportunity to use this policy to their own advantage by exposing it as type                        of blackmail designed among other things to cause suffering this winter                        among young and old people This according to Shah would not benefit Arabs and therefore it would be                        better at this stage to put an end to oil embargo and await results of                        negotiations which have been started Shah points out that if negotiations                        get nowhere oil embargo can always be reinstituted3 According to Iranian Ambassador Sadat listened carefully sent thanks to Shah and said                        would study Shahs message most carefully He also stated he would discuss                        it with other Arab leaders4 Khalatbari then told me that Shah                        had given an interview on November 16 to Lebanese journalist whose name                            Khalatbari could not remember In                        this interview Shah took pains to point out for benefit of Arab readers the                        significant difference between using oil sanctions in time of war and while                        fighting going on and continuing to use them after

 November 26 the Shah publicly advocated the lifting of the oil embargo                            giving diplomacy a chance to achieve peace With the recent acceptance                            of

                           a reasonable possibility that at some time in the future we can see some                            change with regard to some of the Arab oilproducing countries and their

how anyone could imagine such a thing We agreed that                        this was Soviet psychological warfare designed to unsettle the government                        The Shah immediately tied it in to the recent Tudeh PartyIraqi Communist                        proclamation criticizing GOI activities                        Shah is convinced that Soviets are attempting to recreate Tudeh

have been too tough on corruption To which I immediately                        replied No sir you cannot be too tough on corruption There then ensued                        a discussion of what will happen in Iran in the years ahead if corruption is                        not stemmed with billions of dollars floating around in the economy It was                        quite clear from this discussion that the Shah indeed is convinced that his                        program and the countrys future will go right downhill if he is not able to                        deal with the corruption

believe GOI would                        acquiesce but that tactic would contribute little to our overall                        relationship with Iran except add an obligation on our side for services                        rendered by GOI2 We believe it would be far preferable to enhance Iranian comprehension of                        and thereby develop mutuality of interests in Hancock

in this direction More importantly we                        think we should take Shah into our confidence to extent possible concerning                        our planning for Hancock operations All we have                        given GOI so far is the rather thin                        explanation in State 217485Document 42 for Hancocks                        presence in Indian Ocean As far as

attract public                        attention Perhaps we are seeing ghosts but there is little reassurance in                        the skeletal information we have so far seen or passed to GOI3 We

infrequent COD flightsD Whether it is likely we will be making other requests of GOI re task force operations eg port                            visitThe Department replied that the Hancock group would be relieved by the USS Oriskany and escorts around December 8 that the                            duration of the operations was under study that the Oriskany group would operate in the Arabian Sea that the                            original schedules were unchanged for use of the Bandar Abbas airfield                            and the contingency for C141C130 flights would remain for the

216995 to Ankara November 3 discussed the number of Soviet                                overflights which were twice what Turkey had estimated and sent                                instructions for Ambassador Macombers next meeting with Turkish officials                            1 Summary: In meeting morning November 3 and after I raised points                            outlined reftels Bayulken told me that in view of US NATO oriented concerns re overflights and                            in view of fact that numbers had exceeded figure he had given me GOT would promptly reexamine situation and                            he would report back to me as soon as he could End summary2 I met Saturday morning with Foreign Minister Bayulken pursuant to                            reftels I said that I had sought appointment at Depts request to                            reiterate USG concern over imbalance                                GOT treatment of USG and  Soviet Government during present Middle East crisis I                            specifically contrasted GOT                            unwillingness for Incirlik to be used in connection with crisis while at                            same time permitting Soviet overflights I added that USG was concerned by failure on part of                            allies fully to comprehend the danger to NATO itself of divisive shift in strategic balance in                            Middle East and that we were therefore surprised by Turkish actions in                            facilitating these Soviet shipments I noted that the number of                            overflights had exceeded by over one hundred percent the figures he had                            conveyed to me in our last meeting I also noted that Turk Ambassador in                            Washington Esenbel had told Dept that he understood flights had ended                            whereas our information was that they were continuing I referred to                            Article 3 of the Chicago Convention and said that in the light of this                            and of past practices there was no way that USG could be convinced that GOT did not control who used its air space I said that                            quite apart from concerns I had earlier noted we were troubled by                            precedent which GOT was establishing                            visvis Soviet overflights in the situation3 I then referred to USIS Wireless File                            209 date Nov 2Not found and read                            to him background statement by senior unidentified Defense official re                            Turkey overflight situation noting that in public we were in effect                            defending Turkeys actions because we did not believe that USTurkish                            relations would be served by speaking publicly with the same candor I                            was employing privately and directly with him4 I ended presentation by saying that in view of foregoing concerns                                USG would like to know what GOTs intentions were re continuing Soviet                            overflights5 Bayulken was clearly uncomfortable during the presentation He first                            attempted to say that if Turkey had understood it was NATO problem they would have taken                            different attitude but that they had considered matter simply domestic                            Middle East struggle in which Soviets were helping their friends and                            US were helping their friends and Turkey thought it best to stay out                            of dispute6 I pointed out that in beginning our discussions I had noted that                            problem was larger than simple Middle East dispute and that if power                            balance in this area changed as result of Soviet intervention this would                            clearly have adverse consequences elsewhere I reminded him that in                            our earlier conversations he had agreed with this point I also                            referred to the concerns Ambassador Rumsfeld had expressed in NATO councils Finally I said that of all NATO partners Turkey instinctively should                            be in best position to recognize threat to shift of power balance in its                            own back yard7 Bayulken then inquired: What about all those KC135 flights at                            Incirlik I reiterated that if there were any materials at Incirlik                            which we needed in connection with Middle East situation these were                            being moved from Incirlik to another country and deployed from there I                            noted that this being done at very great inconvenience to USG in deference to GOT wishes and this transfer of resources was what the                            C135 flights were concerned with8 Bayulken said he was sure USG                            understood the delicate position that Turkey was in He expressed the                            belief that we did not really want to see a Turkish crisis with the                            Soviets If such a crisis took place he noted it would directly                            involve USG as well for US was Turkeys NATO partner and closest friend In response I said that                                USG did not believe that way to get                            along with Soviets was to have appeasement policy toward their demands                            that in the long run it was better to stand up to them right from the                            start9 Conversation then concluded with Bayulken making two points: first he                            expressed great appreciation for the public posture that we were taking                            and which I had reported to him second that he was not aware of how                            many overflights there had been and that on the basis of my belief that                            they were over double what he had indicated to me and in view of USG conviction that these flights were                            carrying war materials and were continuing GOT would undertake as a NATO partner to look into the matter right away and that                            he would report back to me as soon as he

expressing favorable impression which President Papadopoulos and his reference to the                            importance of elections and political normalization had made I said I                            personally regretted that it had been considered necessary to declare                            martial law throughout the country In the                                early hours of November 17 the Greek armed forces cracked down on                                increased protests In telegram 8037 from Athens November 17 the                                Embassy called the move

                been required because subversive plot had clearly developed He hoped                            need for martial law would be very brief and that progress on political                            front would be resumed He thought that decisive intervention of army                            would make clear to the country and the politicians that the path to                            democracy could and would be restored through the efforts of the present                            government I repeated the point that prompt removal of martial law                            could give the impression of strength3 Markezinis confirmed he was to                            have made important political announcement at his November 17 press                            conference He said he very much appreciated my words and expressed hope                            to have more extended conversation with me this coming week4 Thrust of my exchange with Markezinis was to get message to him and                                Papadopoulos that we                            appreciated continued emphasis on political progress understood efforts                            of subversive elements as Papadopoulos stated to seek to cause political program                            to fail and to encourage them to lift martial law and get on with the                            political program Markezinis said                            he will pass thoughts to Papadopoulos5 Incidentally I should stress that available intelligence just prior to                            the demonstrations gave a clear indication that prospects of full                            participation of old political world were quite promising a fact which                            could not

                              Papadopoulos in a                                bloodless coup on November 25 Ibid but remains without                            question the dominant figure Our intelligence reveals that the new                                PresidentPhaidon Gizikis has had                            an undistinguished career is not considered to have been a strong                            military commander and in general is likely to be completely subject to                            General Ioannides objectives                            and desires As for the new Prime Minister Androutsopoulos I have known him quite well over the                            years I have been here I consider him honest and incorruptible but on                            the timid side Here again I believe he will knuckle down to whatever                            General Ioannides tells him to                            do2 General Ioannides record has                            been that of a persistent tough critic of Papadopoulos a hardliner and the Chief of the Military                            Police which is reputed to have been largely responsible for                            maltreatment of political prisoners He is a puritan at heart and in                            action His behavior as recently recounted by Isouderos and Palamas                            would tend to indicate clearly that it is only matter of time before he                            may decide to push himself to the fore to become the outward expressed                            symbol of Greek political power I would not be surprised if he were to                            replace Ghizikis as President                            There is no reason to think he believes in democracy Perhaps he does                            but the declaration of the armed forces yesterday morning tends to make                            clear that if he does believe in democracy it will probably be of a                            type unacceptable to public opinion of Western Europe and the United                            States3 Because of the background of its principal members this regime can be                            characterized as likely to be proAmerican However I think we should                            accept this conclusion with at least one grain of salt since their                            puritanism on internal matters may become of such overriding importance                            to them as to affect adversely their external interests This could                            affect our security relations This does not mean they would not seek accommodation with the US                            but they are likely to be tough in their bargaining and on some points                            even intractable4 Even more significant in my view will be the danger that a leader                            like Ioannides will polarize                            divisively the countrys political forces The proponents of a united                            front from Karamanlis over to the                            left including the EDA and even the                            Communist left both internal dissidents and external will be greatly                            encouraged The possibility of organized violence on the part of such a                            group already strongly promoted by Andreas                                Papandreou will become greatly increased Further                            repression will increase polarization and could easily lead to a serious                            division in the armed forces which might lead eventually to conflict and                            great political instability I do not believe that US interests would                            gain in this process This process would be greatly facilitated by the                            likely inability of the new regime to deal successfully with the many                            problems facing them and which if not properly tended to will increase                            political tension and polarization What the country needs is not more                            repression and more control but more freedom and more self expression                            politically organized The problems facing Greece such as inflation                            Cyprus students bureaucratic modernization etc will need broad                            popular support if these are to be dealt with not only effectively but                            with a minimum of reaction to some of the tough measures required4 It is of course possible that none of this will happen Some in Athens                            even believe that rapprochement may be in course between Karamanlis and the new regime But based                            purely on the record I am not optimistic on this point I find the                            manner in which Ioannides was                            able to cut across command channels and have discharged or released from                            service a number of officers senior to himself without commitment to any                            political program highly disquieting for the future I also believe that                            even those Greeks who are presently in somewhat of a state of euphoria                            because of their glee with the disappearance of Papadopoulos may find the gray                            morning after grim dismal and depressing There is some real                            indication that some of the military may already be concerned about                            where they are going The Greek military are now engaged in what could                            be a disastrous operation of political intervention This inevitably                            involves them in the divisiveness of internal Greek politics Thus                            instead of restoring their function as an independent defense force                            dedicated only to serving the countrys defense and security needs they                            are becoming entrenched as masters of the people5 It is within the foregoing context that I think the US should                            consider what its posture should be toward General Ioannides and his efforts at this                            timeTasca	19731126frus1969-76v39d179	179 Telegram From the Mission in Geneva

excerpts from all four telegrams see Document 1781 Boster took opportunity of NATO delegation heads caucus Nov 22 to express belief that we should be giving consideration to possible compromise solutions to satisfy strong Soviet desire for noninterference caveats in preamble to specific humanitarian cooperation agreements He informed allies that he had stressed to Kovalev strong Western opposition to a preamble with reference to national laws and customs and gave allies gist of Soviet reaction ref D Boster told NATO delegation heads that he had suggested to Soviets that they think about possible compromise solutions as we were doing He outlined solution we were considering refs A and C stressing that this was for possible future use and that he had not discussed any specific ideas with Kovalev2 Immediate allied reaction was negative as foreshadowed ref B French rep warned that principle of nonintervention means different things to East and West Any tampering with this principle might weaken not strengthen it We should be very clear on broader effects of changes to this principle3 UK rep pointed out that principle of nonintervention even as tabled by Soviets applies only to actions by states whereas much of specific content of Basket III humanitarian cooperation relates to activities of private individuals companies and organizations We should not allow Soviets he said to obtain language in preamble or principles which implies a measure of governmental control over private individuals and organizations Such a result would be contrary to most fundamental allied objectives in Basket III4 UK rep added that in any event Soviets had not tabled any texts including the phrase laws and customs and although this phrase is used in introduction to Bulgarian draft which constitutes formal Eastern position on Basket III preamble the draft text itself does not include it nor does Soviet draft of principle of nonintervention5 Danish rep stressed Soviets should not get anything in return for dropping laws and customs phrase as he anticipated they would seek to do since they had already been forced to drop it in Helsinki In Danish view Gromyko exhibited bad faith in referring back to this phrase before the ink was dry on Helsinki recommendationsFor the Final Recommendations of the Consultations Preceding the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe June 8 see Department of State Bulletin July 30 1973 pp 181188 which already represented a hardfought compromise To raise an issue on which compromise agreement had already been reached went against whole spirit of Helsinki recommendations6 Netherlands rep suggested that a better way to satisfy Soviet need would be to draft language of specific humanitarian agreements in such a way as to identify role of governments without actually mentioning laws and customs Such language should obviate need for preambular caveats Canadian French Danish UK and Norwegian reps agreed with this approach7 Comment Netherlands delegation head has told us privately that he does not think Soviets will accept his idea outlined in para 6 above but that this will show Eastern countries strength of Western opposition to preambular caveats in Basket III When Soviets reject this approach Dutch and other allies would prefer to fall back to innocuous preamble along lines of Helsinki recommendations with unilateral Soviet explanatory statement Dutch feel Soviets will accept this solution basically the same compromise reached in Helsinki but that they will only do so if Western opposition to their desires is firm8 Initial positions taken by our allies on this issue have been predictably firm Nevertheless ground has now been prepared for later recourse to our compromise ideas when negotiating process in drafting stage brings need for more flexibility on both sidesMiller	19731123frus1969-76ve06d97	97 Telegram 12831 From the Embassy in Ethiopia to the Department of State

DELEGATION SHOULD KEEP IN                            MIND THAT THE WORLD FOOD CONFERENCE CAN SERVE TO PREPARE A BROAD POLICY                            FRAMEWORK FOR DEALING WITH FOOD PROBLEMS IN PARTICULAR THE WORLDWIDE                            CONFERENCE CAN INVOLVE THE USSR PRC                            AND MANY DEVELOPING COUNTRIES WHICH MAY NOT BE INVOLVED IN OTHER FORA

      GENERAL OF THE UN WE EXPLAINED THAT THE PURPOSE OF THE WORLD FOOD                            CONFERENCE WOULD BE TO DISCUSS WAYS TO MAINTAIN ADEQUATE FOOD SUPPLIES                            IN THE FACE OR RISING DEMAND AND COMBAT HUNGER AND MALNUTRITION                            RESULTING FROM NATURAL DISASTERS THE UNITED STATES BELIEVES THAT THE                            PRECISE AGENDA SHOULD BE WORKED OUT IN PREPARATORY MEETINGS BY                            INTERESTED GOVERNMENTS AND INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS AND THAT EVERY                            ATTEMPT SHOULD BE MADE TO FOCUS THE WORLD FOOD CONFERENCES ATTENTION ON                            FEW KEY TOPICS WHERE EARLY PROGRESS IN INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION IS                            POSSIBLE TENTATIVE US THINKING ON THE COMPOSITION OF AN AGENDA IS SET                            OUT BELOW1 THE FIRST TASK OF THE CONFERENCE WILL BE TO ASSESS THE LONGTERM                            DEMAND AND SUPPLY OUTLOOK FOR DIFFERENT CATEGORIES OF FOOD IT WILL BE                            DESIRABLE TO TAKE A MORE SOPHISTICATED LOOK AT THE MAGNITUDES OF                            POTENTIAL SURPLUSES OR DEFICITS UNDER HIGH AND LOW ASSUMPTIONS FOR                            DEMAND AND SUPPLY THAN HAS BEEN DONE IN THE PAST BY DEVELOPING THIS                            TYPE OF INFORMATION THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY CAN PLAN INTELLIGENTLY                            FOR SHORT TERM CONTINGENCIES AND ADJUST PRODUCTION POLICIES FOR LONG RUN                            BALANCE IT IS THE US BELIEF BASED ON OUR OWN ASSESSMENT OF THE                            SITUATION THAT THE WORLD MUST ANTICIPATE BOTH PERIODS OF SHORTAGES AND                            PERIODS OF ADEQUATE OR MORE THAN ADEQUATE SUPPLIES IT IS THE FORMER                            SITUATION THAT THE WORLD FOOD CONFERENCE SHOULD FOCUS ON2 AN ASSESSMENT OF THE PACE OF TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE AFFECTING BOTH                            SUPPLY AND DEMAND FACTORS WILL ALSO BE CRUCIAL TO INTELLIGENT                            INTERNATIONAL ACTION AS HAS BEEN ABUNDANTLY ILLUSTRATED BY THE GREEN                            REVOLUTION IMPLEMENTATION OF NEW TECHNOLOGY CAN LAG SUBSTANTIALLY AS                            UNFORESEEN CONSTRAINTS ARE ENCOUNTERED IT WOULD THEREFORE BE USEFUL                            TO REACH A GREATER INTERNATIONAL UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT WILL BE REQUIRED                            TO BREAK PRODUCTION BOTTLENECKS AND IMPROVE TECHNIQUES FOR FOOD STORAGE                            ON THE DEMAND SIDE CONSUMER ACCEPTANCE OF NEW VARIETIES OF HIGHER                            YIELDING CROPS AND SYNTHETIC FOODS MAY BE A GREATER CONSTRAINT THAN                            TECHNICAL AND ECONOMIC FEASIBILITY OF PRODUCTION ON THE SUPPLY SIDE WE                            MUST SEEK WAYS FOR DEVELOPING COUNTRIES TO IMPROVE THEIR OWN FOOD                            PRODUCTION AND EXPORT OPPORTUNITIES ON AN ECONOMIC BASIS FOR THOSE WHO                            HAVE A COMPARATIVE ADVANTAGE SO THAT DEPENDENCE ON FOOD AID IN THE                            FUTURE CAN BE LESSENED AND THEY ARE LESS SUBJECT TO THE VAGARIES OF                            CHANGES IN THE WORLDS FOOD SUPPLY3 IT IS IMPORTANT NOT TO PREJUDGE THE ISSUE OF THE SUPPLYDEMAND                            BALANCE SINCE MANY EXISTING LONGTERM PROJECTIONS INDICATE A TENDENCY                            TOWARD SURPLUS IN COMMERCIAL MARKETS RATHER THAN SHORTAGES FOR MOST                            CATEGORIES OF FOOD FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE IF THE WORLD FOOD                            CONFERENCE AGREES ON THE NEED IN ANY CASE TO PROVIDE FOR THE CONTINGENCY                            OF POSSIBLE SHORTAGES IT COULD CONSIDER WHAT PRINCIPLES MIGHT ASSURE                            ADEQUATE SUPPLIES OF PARTICULAR CATEGORIES OF FOOD BOTH IN THE                            SHORTTERM AND LONGRUNTHUS AFTER ASSESSING THE SITUATION THE WORLD FOOD CONFERENCE MIGHT                            ADDRESS: A FOOD SECURITY IF ASSURANCES ON FOOD RESERVES TO SAFEGUARD AGAINST                            TEMPORARY SUPPLY SHORTFALLS

  AN IMPORTANT PART OF THE WORLD FOOD CONFERENCE ALTHOUGH WE SHOULD TRY                            TO AVOID THEIR BECOMING ONE OF THE MAJOR CENTERPIECES BECAUSE OF THE                            DIVERSITY AND COMPLEXITY OF ISSUES IN THE FIELD IT IS POSSIBLE THAT                            THE CONFERENCE MIGHT ADDRESS POPULATION AS A SEPARATE ISSUE ALTHOUGH WE                            WOULD PREFER THAT PRINCIPAL DISCUSSION ON THIS ISSUE BE FOCUSED IN THE                            WORLD POPULATION CONFERENCE IN AUGUST 19744 THE US DELEGATION SHOULD ALSO EMPHASIZE THAT THE US PROPOSAL FOR                            A WORLD FOOD CONFERENCE IS FULLY CONSISTENT WITH THE MULTILATERAL TRADE                            NEGOTIATIONS NOW JUST BEGINNING WE BELIEVE THAT THEY ARE COMPLEMENTARY

     MOST IMPORTANT AND IN DEVELOPING OR SELECTING PROPOSALS FOR PRINCIPLES                            TO BE CONSIDERED BY THE WORLD FOOD CONFERENCE THE COMMITTEE SHOULD HAVE                            A SECRETARY GENERAL AND STAFF APPOINTED BY THE SECRETARY GENERAL OF THE                            UNITED NATIONS6 THE US FAVORS THE WIDEST POSSIBLE GOVERNMENTAL PARTICIPATION

COUNTRY CAN AFFECT THE WORLD THE MOST PRESSING HUMAN PROBLEM IS THAT OF                            PERIODS OF FOOD DEFICIENCY IN MANY COUNTRIES SO THAT THE ACTIVE                            PARTICIPATION OF THESE COUNTRIES IS ALSO CRUCIAL TO THE SUCCESS OF ANY                            FOOD SECURITY SCHEME THE US BELIEVES THAT THE TIME HAS COME WHERE

               26 ON THE SUBJECT TEXT SENT SEPTEL                            THIS TEXT WAS THE SUBJECT OF NUMEROUS COMPROMISES SINCE ALL PARTIES                            AND IN PARTICULAR THE FAO SECRETARIAT WISHED TO AVOID A DOCUMENT WHICH                            WOULD LEAVE THE IMPRESSION THAT THE FAO WAS UNABLE TO SPEAK WITH ONE                            VOICE AND THUS UNQUALIFIED TO

THE FRENCH DELEGATION                            WHICH WAS EVENTUALLY PERSUADED BY OTHERS TO AGREE3 THE TWO MAJOR ISSUES PROVOKED BY THE DRAFT WERE THOSE OF THE EXTENT OF                            COMMITMENTS TO BE ENTERED INTO AT THE WFC AND WHAT SUBJECT MATTER THE                            WFC SHOULD COVER ON FIRST POINT AND AFTER MUCH DEBATE ON FLOOR SEE                                REFTEL B AND IN THE DRAFTING                            COMMITTEE THE FOLLOWING COMPROMISE SENTENCE WAS AGREED: THE PRINCIPAL                            TASK OF THE WFC ON WHICH MOST OF ITS EFFORTS SHOULD BE FOCUSED SHOULD                            BE TO BRING ABOUT A COMMITMENT BY THE WORLD COMMUNITY AS A WHOLE TO                            UNDERTAKE CONCRETE ACTION TOWARDS RESOLVING THE WORLD

                      WITHOUT AT THE SAME TIME SUGGESTING ANY BINDING NATIONAL COMMITMENTS 4 THE SECOND ISSUE WAS THAT OF THE ROLE OF TRADE IN THE WFC HERE THE                            TEXT OF THE REPORT NOTES THAT WHILE THE WFC WAS NOT ENVISAGED AS A                            NEGOTIATING FORUM IT SHOULD NEVERTHELESS AIM AT REACHING AGREEMENT ON                            SPECIFIC OBJECTIVES

 ONE IN WHICH THE CENTRAL FOCUS MUST BE TRADE WITH THE COMMITMENTS TO BE                            OBTAINED AT THE CONFERENCE AS BINDING AS POSSIBLE IT ALSO SHOWS THE                            SENSITIVITY OF DEVELOPED COUNTRIES ON THE TRADE ISSUE AND THEIR DESIRE                            TO AVOID ANY ACTIONS AT THE WFC WHICH MIGHT PREJUDICE THE MTN WE CAN EXPECT BOTH OF THESE ISSUES TO

PARTICULARLY IN VIEW OF THE                            FACT THAT THE MEMBERS OF THE MOVEMENT CLOSEST TO THE SCENE ARE IN                            GENERAL THE LEST DESIROUS OF CONCERTED NONALIGNED ACTION NONALIGNED                            POSITION ON THESE QUESTIONS SEEMS TO BE COMBINATION OF EMOTIONAL                            RESPONSE TO SITUATION THEY SEE AS ANALOGOUS TO THEIR OWN PROBLEMS AND A                            PRACTICAL DESIRE TO EXCHANGE THEIR VOTES ON ISSUES NOT OF ESSENTIAL                            INTEREST TO THEM FOR COMMUNIST SUPPORT ON ITEMS OF REAL

ALMOST TOTAL AFRICAN SUPPORT FOR ARAB CAUSE IN MIDDLE EAST AFRICANS                            AND ARABS IN TURN ARE MAKING STRONG EFFORTS TO WIN INCREASING SUPPORT                            FROM

SOLIDARITY THIS GA SESSION WAS                            OBVIOUSLY THE NONALIGNED CONFERENCE AT ALGIERS HELD JUST PRIOR TO GA                            OPENING AND CLEARLY DESIGNED TO PROMOTE JUST THIS KIND OF UNITY AT UN                            ON A VARIETY OF ISSUES THAT HAVE ARISEN WE ARE INCREASINGLY AWARE OF                            IMPORTANCE OF RESOLUTIONS ADOPTED AT ALGIERS ON KOREAN ISSUE FOR                            EXAMPLE WE RAN INTO GREAT RELUCTANCE EVEN AMONG SOUTH KOREAS FRIENDS                            TO TAKE POSITIONS CONTRARY TO ALGIERS DECISION A TUNISIAN DELEGATE                            UNABASHEDLY ASSERTED THAT NONALIGNED STATE COULD VOTE CONTRARY TO                            ALGIERS RESOLUTION BUT COULD AT THE MOST ABSTAIN WE WITNESSED                            RECENTLY AN INTERESTING ENCOUNTER IN FIFTH COMMITTEE IN WHICH MAURITIAN                            AMB ALSO AFRICAN GROUP LEADER WAS IMMEDIATELY AND PUBLICLY CALLED TO

SAY AT PRESENT                            IS THAT REFLEX FOR UNITY IS STRONG AND PEER PRESSURE IS HIGHLY                            PERSUASIVE9 ALGERIAN DELEGATION IS DRIVEN TO ASSERT LEADERSHIP OVER

          AVOIDING SO FAR HEADON CONFRONTATION IT REMAINS TO BE SEEN WHETHER                            THE MORE MODERATE AMONG THE NONALIGNED WILL CONTINUE TO FOLLOW                            HARDLINE ALGERIANSTYLE LEADERSHIP10 NONALIGNED STATES CLEARLY SENSE POWER THEY CAN WIELD AND NOW THERE                            IS A DISTURBING TENDENCY TO USE THIS POWER ON INCREASING NUMBER OF
