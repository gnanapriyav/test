following message from President Ford to President Sadat:Quote: Dear Mr President: I write to you as a friend                        as an admirer of your great statesmanship of your courage and                        integrityAbove all Mr President I am writing to you convinced more than ever that                        the course we have chosen together is the right one for Egypt for all of                        the Arabs and for the United StatesThe successful conclusion of the second agreement between Egypt and Israel on                        the Sinai was as I have said a historic achievement It is a decision you                        took in order to advance toward a just and lasting peace in the Middle East                        not only as you said to me for your country but for the entire area Now                        that this agreement has been concluded I want to share with you my views of                        the current situation and of prospects for the futureThe agreement just concluded has brought tangible benefits to Egypt Not only                        will you recover the use of your nations oil resources in the Sinai but                        you have also brought about Israels withdrawal from the strategic Sinai                        passes To have foregone these gains in order to pursue without laying any                        groundwork an allornothing negotiation at Geneva would in my judgment                        have assured stalemate and a rapid deterioration of the situation to the the                        benefit of no one country It was this reality which led us as it did you                        to conclude that a further interim agreement was the only way to make early                        practical progress In seizing this opportunity you have made possible what                        could become in your own words a turning point toward peace with justice                        not only for Egypt but also for the entire Arab world to which Egypt has so                        long given leadership These realities will survive long after the criticism                        emanating from some quarters has been forgottenHere in the United States I believe things are going well The Congress is                        showing a sympathetic understanding of the agreement and of the                        responsibilities which the United States has undertaken in connection with                        it I believe that the Congress will shortly give its approval to the US                        proposal to entrust to American civilian technicians the early warning system in the Sinai passes to serve                        as you so aptly put it as witnesses to the implementation of the peace                            agreementIn a letter of September 2                            President Ford sent the US                            proposal for the early warning system in the Sinai to Congress for its                            approval The letter was released on September 3 for text see Public Papers: Ford 1975 Book II pp 12921293 The                        Congress also appears favorably disposed toward providing the economic                        assistance to Egypt which we discussed in Salzburg and which Secretary                            Kissinger further discussed with                        you in Alexandria I plan to submit a request to the Congress for dols 700                        million in economic assistance for EgyptWe have also been in touch with a number of other governments to emphasize                        how important this agreement is as a step toward a just and lasting peace                        We have encouraged them to give broad support to you Despite the                        predictable criticisms which have come from certain countries I am                        convinced that history will show that you are the only Arab leader who has                        made tangible progress toward a just peace The world will come to                        understand that you made your historic decision not just for Egypt but for                        all Arabs We will continue to make these points with other governments and                        to urge them to take concrete actions to demonstrate their support of your                        policiesI have noted the public expressions of concern coming from the Middle East                        that the agreement not freeze the situation diplomatically I share this                        view With particular reference to Syria Secretary Kissinger has told President Asad that we would make a serious effort to                        help achieve progress on the Syrian front and he has assured President                            Asad that the United States                        counts on a united Arab world to further the peace process In our view                        division in the Arab world is the danger to future progress As I have said                        on numerous occasions we are committed to the proposition that a lasting                        peace in the Middle East must involve progress on all fronts and must be                        based on careful attention to the interests of all its people including the                        PalestiniansWith regard to the Soviet Union I want you to know that we have taken a very                        firm line with General Secretary Brezhnev The Soviet response while complaining over the                        lack of involvement in the negotiations indicates that they do not intend                        to play an obstructionist role I have reason to believe based on a                        communication we received within the last twentyfour hours from the                        Soviets that they will not make major difficulties Secretary Kissinger will be meeting Foreign Minister                            Gromyko next week to discuss the                        situation and we will keep you currently informed as we have throughout                        of these exchangesKissinger sent a message to Sadat describing his discussions with Gromyko Telegram 225082 to Cairo                            September 20 National Archives RG 59                            Central Foreign Policy FilesAn additional reason for my high sense of gratification at the successful                        conclusion of this agreement is the prospect that it will now be possible                        for you and Mrs Sadat to visit the United States Your visit is one that                        Mrs Ford and I have long looked forward to with great pleasure I want the                        American people to get to know you as I do I am confident that such a visit                        will reinforce both our official and personal ties and reinforce our mutual                        efforts to achieve peace in the Middle East I hope you will plan on both a                        State visit to Washington as well as allow time to travel to other parts of                        America I would like to suggest that you plan your visit starting October                        28With warm regards to you Mrs Sadat and your family Sincerely Gerald R Ford UnquoteEnd message2 FYI: One million tons of grain under PL 480 is in                        addition to dollars 700 million mentioned in Presidents letter End

214124Telegram 214124 to Tehran                            September 9 transmitted a letter from Ford to the Shah expressing his concerns about the                            impact of high oil prices on the international economy and about                            possible OPEC price increases in the                            fall Ibid D7503120062 The telegram is printed in Foreign

Venezuelan President PrezFollowing is the exact text of a message we received from the Ministry of                        Court for the President from the Shah: Dear Mr President: I thank you for                        your message of September 9 the contents of which I have noted very                        carefullyAs you are no doubt aware Iran has always been a firm believer and supporter                        of a dialogue between developing and developed nations in order to                        contribute to the solution of the chronic economic problems with which the                        world at large is beset It was in this spirit that at my suggestions                            OPEC agreed to freeze the price of oil                        until the end of September 1975 although we were subject to the continued                        inflation exported to our countriesHowever I feel constrained to say that it does not appear justifiable to us                        to continue the freeze and to tolerate a decrease of about 35 per cent in                        our purchasing power before such a dialogue takes place In this context it                        is worthy to note that we have no influence on the prices of commodities and                        manufactured goods which are imposed upon us There are many items of goods                        that we buy this year 300 to 400 per cent more in price from the United                        States of America than we did 18 months ago and we have no choice other than                        to pay the price demanded Furthermore you know very well Mr President                        that we always take a moderate line and there are many members of OPEC who are demanding much greater increases                        in the price of oil than we areWith regard to the adverse effect of any increase in oil prices on the                        recovery of the industrialized countries I would like to draw your                        attention to the fact that firstly the tax imposed by the consuming                        industrialized nations on oil products which on average nearly equals the                        government take of the oil producing nations can very well be adjusted to                        take care of any increase in oil prices In the case of the United States of                        America considering lifting the two dollar tariff imposed on imported crude                        which has been under discussion could very well serve the same purposeSecondly bearing in mind the longterm interests of the world community                        particularly of the industrialized countries the sound economic growth of                        which directly affects the industrialization of the OPEC nations an increase in oil prices is                        imperative to create sufficient incentive for the development of alternative                        sources of energy which in the case of the United States in particular would                        render Project Independence a realityThirdly with regard to the adverse effect on the economy of nonoil                        producing developing countries I have in mind a plan of assistance for these                        nations in the form of grantinaid which hopefully with the support of the                            OPEC countries can be put into effect                        immediatelyThe precarious worldwide monetary situation started well before we increased                        the price of oil and after we effected this increase it was responsible for                        only two per cent of the world inflation which was running between 12 and 27                        per cent For example to stress the point according to international                        reports the gold reserves especially of European countries are now greater                        than they were before the increase in the price of oilI also appreciate very much and greatly value the special relationship that                        exists between our two countries which as you fully recognize Mr                        President is not only in favor of Iran but is mutually and equally                        beneficial to both sides If in defending our legitimate interests we might                        raise serious questions among the American people we would be very sorry to                        ascertain that the real facts have not been set before your publicWith best wishes and kindest

be forced to join Iraq in opposing such a presence                        which he said bitterly The Zionist lobby will have no trouble getting                        past Congress Comment: Certainly both USSR and GOI                        likely to seize on this as aspect of agreement most likely to support                        hostile propaganda campaign among other Arab states3 What is most humiliating to the GOI Baath                        Party leadership is Sadats admission that the Arabs collectively cannot put                        together enough clout to make progress in the dispute with Israel without                        calling in outsiders Iraq is very proud of the fact that it settled its                        quarrel with Iran and put down the Kurdish rebellion without having to bring                        in nonArab third parties Algerias Boumedienne having been the key                        mediator If similar situations arise at future stages of

could somehow be shown to be in longrange interest of                        Iraqs Palestinian clients US success in Sinai means serious setback to                        Iraqi position of implacable opposition to partial solutions and if the                        subject has to be addressed it would be charitable to do so soberly and                        without rubbing salt in wounds5 VOA newscasts morning of September fifth described Anwar Sadats sharp                        critism of USSR Syria and Iraq for their                        opposition to Sinai pact Offhand it appears that USSR may be giving up on efforts to influence Egypt and is                        falling back upon hard core of Syria Iraq and Palestinians whom it will                        encourage to make mischief rather than work with moderate Arabs for an                        enduring peace If this is so USSR will                        probably cast itself as only real friend of Palestinians among the major                        powerswith US portrayed as foe not only of Palestinians but of Arab unity                        as well US has demonstrated that it is friend of moderate Arabs and of                        Israel Excruciatingly difficult challenge now is to be seen as friend of Palestinians as well in order to                        prevent polarization USSR appears to be

morning of September third and was decoded around                        noon Time does not yet seem ripe to raise this personally with MFA I recommend that prior to proposed talk

                       Baghdad 898 B Baghdad 900 C Baghdad 919 D Baghdad 920Documents 294 295 296 and 2971 Summary: If no progress is made at the proposed                            UNGA contact what is the nature of                        the status quo in bilateral relations upon which we fall back It is much                        better than October 1972 when US diplomats returned to Baghdad But it is                        limited to economic and consular affairs It is probable that antiAmerican                        propaganda would grow louder and more tedious but this would probably not                        dampen the economic relationship End summary2 It is obviously all too possible that proposed UNGA contact between Secretary and GOI Foreign Minister will not yield breakthrough on the four                        issues addressed in reftels: Palestine arms oil and the Sinai The result                        would be a fallback upon the status quo with possibility of either limited                        deterioration or limited improvement in our currently restricted bilateral                        relations3 It may be useful to contrast the elements of the status quo in 1975 with                        what it was in October 1972 when the first US diplomats returned to Baghdad                        In 1972 and for some months to come the USINT officers were subjected to massive police surveillance                        and access to GOI officialdom was for all                        practical purposes restricted to one middle grade officer of the MFA At one stage the weekly exchange of                        classified pouches with the courier at Baghdad Airport transit lounge was                        elaborately filmed and videotaped by security police Beginning with the                        summer of 1973 however and the pragmatic opening up of the Iraqi economy                        to the West USINT began to have greater                        access to bureaucracy Now we can see any Director General in any Ministry                        with little or no difficulty Given the excellent internal vertical flow of                        information at least in the Economic Ministries that is all the access we                        need4 American businessmen are pouring into Baghdad with the pace quickening                        all the time According to one source in a position to know after the                        recent state of Mississippi trade mission the secret police were ordered to                        cease shadowing all American visitors without exception as they had been                        and to begin tailing only those whom they had positive reason to suspect By                        March of 1976 when much of the next fiscal years funds will have been                        obligated by the GOI there will probably                        be up to 20 American contracting firms resident in Iraq with perhaps 400 or                        500 Americans employed by the companies5 By July 1976 USINT will have been                        forced to move from its present location by expiry of our lease Since only                        two or three FSOs now in Washington have seen these premises it is                        necessary to underline the absolute unsuitability of what was built as a ten                        room residence to serve as a US diplomatic office in the current and                        emerging status quo For we are now issuing 300500 visas per month                        receiving calls from 3060 US businessmen per month and from visiting                            USG officers every second month and we                        have four states planning to send trade missions We could not find office                        space for even one more American in our current premises6 In the presumptive status quo which would emerge after lack of progress at                        the UNGA meeting bilateral trading and                        other economic relations will remain and intensify The number of Iraqi                        visitors to the US will continue to grow But if the USSR Syria and Iraq dig in their heels                        against the Sinai settlement and actively support the more extreme                        Palestinian demands the already tedious volume of daily antiAmerican                        propaganda will swell In such an atmosphere there are no obvious devices                        which we can suggest or employ for marginal improvement of the status quo                        The GOI badly needs expertise on English                        language training and curriculum formation and the British Council regularly                        turns away hundreds of applicants for study of EnglishIraqs diplomatic and                        international language par excellence We could be very helpful in this area if Iraq were willing to                        accept our help and it is an area which we might well probe But apart from                        this it is hard to see other new areas in which we can hope for marginal                        improvement USGsponsored cultural events                        will not be accepted US participation in the Baghdad International Fair                        will not be permitted The MFA has been                        lukewarm at best in responding to our overtures for technical talks on                        energy7 In short failure to move forward at UNGA will leave us with a workable status quo with very little                        likelihood of marked qualitative improvement It is a status quo however                        to which both sides have grown accustomed and which has elements of                        advantage to both of usKillough	19750905

directed during your consultations here we want you to                            go back to Antunes on your                            return and advise him in connection with his earlier representations to                            you that we increase our airlift of refugees from Angola that before                            reaching any decision to do so we frankly need some better understanding                            than we have now on Portuguese policy and objectives in Angola We leave                            it to your discretion whether to make similar or supporting                            representations to Azevedo2 For your discussion you already have available State 199405In telegram 199405 to Lisbon August 21                                    Carlucci was instructed                                to draw out what GOP intentions                                and general policy are with respect to Angola and to present US                                objectives in Angola National Archives RG 59 Central Foreign Policy Files                                P8500472496 general talking points with respect to USG policy in Angola With that as                            background you should indicate to Antunes our hope and expectation that GOP actions in and with respect to Angola                            will in future more accurately                            reflect stated GOP policy of complete                            neutrality You should indicate that in recent months it has seemed to                            us that GOP more often than not has                            departed from that policy You should make clear that in our view a                            policy of neutrality with respect to Angola dictates that Portugal take                            steps to correct present posture which for example seems to be one of                            acquiescing in delivery of Soviet arms to MPLA and of pressuring Savimbi to come to terms with the MPLA at the expense of the former We can                            appreciate GOP policy of seeking                            genuine accommodation among opposing factions in Angola in order to                            facilitate peaceful transition of power on November 11 However we                            believe current GOP policy has amounted                            to one of pressuring Savimbi to                            come to terms with the MPLA on a                            coalition arrangement a policy that serves more to serve MPLA objectives than it does to effect a                            genuine peaceful transition of the kind Portugal professes to seek3 There follows our assessment of where we believe GOP policy has departed from one of                            neutrality and from which you may draw for your conversation with                                Antunes4 Portuguese Assistance to the MPLA                            There is little evidence of direct Portuguese assistance to the MPLA in the form of material support                            However Portuguese actionsor more often the failure to take                            appropriate actionhave had the practical and sometimes intended effect                            of assisting the MPLA5 Arms Control Admittedly the small number of Portuguese troops in                            Angola have been limited in their ability to monitor and control arms                            shipments into the territory by all three liberation movements                            Nevertheless even in those instances where the Portuguese were in a                            position to take action they have not This is particularly true of                            arms deliveries by air and sea to MPLAcontrolled areas along the southern coast For example a                            recent clandestine report indicates that a large shipment of arms was                            delivered by a Soviet vessel to Porto Amboim south of Luanda in mid                            August According to the report Portuguese military officials advised                            the MPLA to use an inconspicuous route                            in moving the arms which included a number of armored vehicles and                            tanks to MPLA bases near Caxito The                            weapons subsequently were used in the MPLAs successful offensive to recapture Caxito on                            September 6 It is impossible to determine whether such actions are                            undertaken by local Portuguese commanders acting on their own initiative                            or reflect the conscious policies of higher officials In either case                            the result is the same6 Security Portuguese actions have also assisted the MPLA in gaining complete military control                            over the capital of Luanda The deliberate policy of not intervening in                            the fighting in the capital resulted in the gradual erosion of the                            positions of both the FNLA and UNITA In early August the Acting High                            Commissioner forced the FNLA to surrender its one remaining                            garrison at the Sao Pedro de Barra fortress ostensibly to remove the                            potential threat to shipping specifically oil tankers in the Luanda                            harbor Despite Portugals announced intention to secure a similar                            withdrawal of MPLA troops and to                            demilitarize the capital it has made no effort to do so7 Indirect Political Assistance The unwillingness andor inability of                            the Portuguese to assure the safety of FNLA and UNITA                            politicial officials in Luanda was a major factor leading to the                            decisions by both movements to withdraw their representatives from the                            transitional government When the MPLA                            subsequently moved to take over the abandoned Ministries Portuguese                            officials voiced no objections Later in setting up the new                            Directorates General to replace the Ministries in the transitional                            government the Portuguese High Commissioner relied almost exclusively                            on MPLA and proMPLA appointees Despite an announced                            limitation on the authority of the Directorates General the High                            Commissioner has interpreted the decree in such a way as to allow the                                MPLA appointees to make major                            policy decisions such as assuming control of private banks and                            insurance companies8 Diplomatic Activities A number of high ranking leftists within the                            Portuguese armed forces movement have been lobbying for some time both                            in Lisbon and with neighboring African states for the creation of a                            coalition government in Angola that would exclude the FNLA Recognizing that any accommodation                            between the MPLA and FNLA is out of the question these                            officials hope that a nominal coalition of the MPLA and UNITA would at                            least allow Portugal to claim the presence in Luanda of a government                            representing a majority of Angolans when it withdraws from the territory                            on November 11 That view now seems to reflect official Portuguese                            policy for AngolaSisco	19750917

President Costa                                Gomes I remained behind and spent 15 minutes alone with                            the President to discuss Angola2 Told him USG was becoming                            increasingly concerned about evolution of events in Angola Under no                            circumstances would we tolerate a Communist takeover there While the                            official GOP policy was one of                            neutrality we had information that that policy was not being observed on                            the ground For example Soviet arms continued to arrive in Angola in                            large quantities The GOP had said it                            was going to evacuate MPLA forces from                            Luanda but that had not happened No effort had been made to impede the                                MPLA military advances We knew of                            one occasion where Portuguese troops had actually facilitated a MPLA military maneuver3 We also knew that pressure was being applied to Savimbi to get him to join with MPLA The US could not accept a solution                            where Angola was turned over to the control of a group the MPLA which had achieved hegemony by the                            naked use of force supported from abroad4 Costa Gomes replied that the                                GOP was criticized on all sides for                            its Angolan policy MPLA accused it of                            favoring FNLA Just recently in Bissau                            at a meeting of the World Peace Conference the MPLA had attacked the partisanship of the Portuguese                            forces Costa Gomes said GOP had tried to bring the three parties                            together When Alvor Accord broke down GOP appealed to neighboring African states for help He                            understood that the OAU now intended to                            send a goodwill mission It was as hard to get the FNLA and the MPLA to sit together as it was to get the PCP and PPD together in Lisbon but GOP intended to keep trying Their goal was to have a valid                            interlocutor to whom to turn over power on November 115 As far as arms were concerned these were coming in to all the parties                            from a number of sources UNITA had                            received arms through Zambia The FNLA                            had received French equipment and Chinese arms as well as support from                            Zaire The Portuguese forces were essentially located at five points:                            Cabinda Luanda Nova Lisboa Lobito and Sa da Bandeira They had very                            little capacity to restrict the arms flow or impede military movements                            Some progress had been made in negotiating MPLA troops out of Luanda6 I said I had to clarify to my government exactly what GOP policy was Were they neutral or were                            they favoring MPLA Costa Gomes said their policy was one                            of neutrality but MPLA enjoyed                            greater popular support than FNLA                            although latter had superior military capacity He pointed out that                                FNLA had had modern equipment at                            the battle of Caxito When I asked why they lost he said because MPLA forces have a better spirit and more                            popular support7 I said that that was not exactly Washingtons understanding of the                            respective support and military capacity of these two groups but that                            was not the essential point Did Portugal intend to continue to allow                            the MPLA to expand with the intention                            of turning Angola over to it on November 11 Costa Gomes claimed MPLA was not Communistit would be like                                FRELIMO perhaps but that in                            any event GOP policy was to continue to                            try to work with the three groups without showing favoritism to any                                Costa Gomes pointed to                            yesterdays September 18 interview by Angolan High Commissioner                                Cardoso to the effect that                            Portugal does not feel it has the legal right to hand over power on                            November 11 only to MPLA that MPLA does not presently represent the                            Angolan people and that GOP will                            continue to try to unite the three movements8 Comment: As usual Costa Gomes has any number of reasons for not taking a                            strong stand ie GOP is accused of                            partisanship by both sides therefore it must be neutral its military                            capability is limited and MPLA isnt                            really so bad While I doubt GOP could                            do anything significant to alter military situation if it wanted to our                            dmarche may have an effect on the kind of political solution the GOP espouses Costa Gomes has at least been put on notice regarding                            our strong viewsIn telegram 5546 from                                Lisbon September 20 Carlucci reported on his meeting with Melo Antunes where he restated                                US concerns about the deteriorating situation in Angola Melo Antunes expressed his                                concern and promised: You may inform your government that I am                                very conscious of the situation and of the repercussions it can have                                abroad I intend to use all the political force and all the military                                force I can muster to create a more stable situation prior to                                independence IbidCarlucci	19750919
frus1969-76v28d130	130 Telegram From the Consulate in Luanda to the Department of State	None	1975-09-25 17:00:00	None	None	1430 Subject: Portuguese Will Not Accede to UDI by MPLA1 I talked on September 24 with High Commissioner Admiral Cardoso about the politicomilitary                            situation and specifically what the Portuguese Governments attitude would be toward an                                MPLA unilateral declaration of                            independence2 Cardoso said he just queried                            Lisbon on GOP policy with respect to                            any attempt by the MPLA to take over                            the country and was told that under no circumstances will the Portuguese                            Government acquiesce in such a move If the MPLA attempts a UDI before                            scheduled independence day on November 11 Portugal will stand fast If                            an acceptable political solution cannot be found by November 11 the                                GOP must try and give jurisdiction                            to the United Nations If that body refuses to take a hand Cardoso said he may just stay on in                            Luanda as the symbol of Portuguese sovereignty until a formula can be                            found that will bring at least one other liberation movement into the                            government Cardoso does not                            believe that MPLA will attempt a                                UDI before November 11 The                            Portuguese have intelligence to the effect that the Soviet Union told                                MPLA about a month ago that a                                UDI now would not be politically                            expedient3 If MPLA does try to take over the                            country he said he is confident that Portuguese troops will fight                            They do not like the MPLA and their                            antagonism is growing Cardoso                            cited three reasons for this feeling Firstly whites here universally                            blame the MPLA and its popular power                            groups for the ills that have befallen Angola Although some of the                            troops have little use for Portuguese colons many of them have                            relations and friends here and identify with their plight The soldiers                            who have been in Angola for some time have a different attitude than the                            military in Portugal itselfthey have seen the Angolan situation on the                            ground and they definitely do not sympathize with the MPLA They are not pro FNLA or pro UNITA merely antiMPLA                            Secondly the campaign of vilification by the MPLAcontrolled media in Luanda against the Portuguese                            military has served to solidify the antiMPLA feeling among the troops Thirdly when FNLA attacked Caxito on July 25 the                                MPLA fell back so rapidly as to                            arouse suspicion they were trying to draw the Portuguese into the                            battle4 Cardoso said there are now                            20000 Portuguese troops in Angola 12000 of them in Luanda of which                            6000 can be classified as combat troops By November 1 he said 9000                            of the troops in Luanda will have been withdrawn and the 3000 that                            remain will be specially selected for combat readiness They will be                            removed on November 105 I asked about the defense of Luanda in the event of an FNLA attack Cardoso said that MPLA                            President Agostinho Neto called                            on him two days after his return here as High Commissioner He told                                Neto that he would not use                            his troops to defend the city against FNLA unless MPLA withdrew                            its forces from Luanda Neto                            promised to give him a reply within two days but to date Cardoso has not heard from him Lisbon                            has told the High Commissioner that he is to defend the city                            notwithstanding MPLA presence but he                            told me Lisbon does not understand the realities the only leverage he has with MPLA is to refuse to send his troops into                            battle in the event of an attack on Luanda Again if Portuguese                            soldiers were to fight alongside MPLA                            troops the world would be even more convinced of the myth that the                                GOP is in league with the MPLA6 Cardoso backtracked a bit to                            review Portuguese policy in Angola since April 25 1974 Former High                            Commissioner Admiral Rosa                                Coutinho was charged with strengthening both MPLA and UNITA in order to counterbalance the then overwhelming                                FNLA military superiority MPLA at that time in military terms was                            on its knees he said and UNITA was                            not even that far off the floorit was prostrate Rosa Coutinho succeeded in his                            efforts but since the installation of the transitional government on                            January 31 1975 the Portuguese policy has been one of active                            neutralitytreat all three movements alike and get involved with none of                            them except to see that they all had what they needed to function                            properly7 If any movement has been favored continued Cardoso it has been UNITA and yet UNITA President Savimbi complains bitterly about                            imagined GOP favoritism toward MPLA The High Commissioner said he sent                            a letter late last week to Savimbi in which he pointed out that Savimbi knows what Portugals policy is                            and he knows where Cardoso                            stands He told Savimbi that if                            he thinks he Cardoso is                            partial to the MPLA he is completely                            wrong8 The GOP is not helping the MPLA in any way said Cardoso even though the MPLA political ideas more closely                            approximate those of the Portuguese military than either of the other                            two liberation movements Foreign Minister Melo Antunes while on the left is a reasonable man who                            leans toward the countries he has always been in the center and is                            pleased to see the pendulum swinging toward him Cardoso added that after MPLA drove both FNLA and UNITA out of                            Luanda in July and August it began to assume charge of the entire                            governmental apparatus He said he went to then Acting High Commissioner                            General Macedo explained the danger and recommended that Macedo take                            corrective action It was then that Macedo took over the administrative                            powers formerly reserved to the Presidential Council Cardoso said he cannot guarantee that                            individual officers and soldiers do not help one or another movementall                            three have received such assistance but these are actions taken on the                            spot by Portuguese military and the movement they help depends upon the                            circumstances and outlook of the officers involved and their perception                            of the situation He said that as High Commissioner his physical                            location has a great deal to do with how people view his role: if he                            were sitting in Carmona or Nova Lisboa he would most certainly be                            accused of siding with FNLA or UNITA9 As far as he is concerned he went on his presence in Luanda allows                            him to serve as a brake on the MPLA                            He pointed out that he has taken over the visa issuing function                            precisely in order to prevent the MPLA                            from slipping in foreign advisors The only interesting cases that                            have come to his attention are the applications of a French movie                            actress and seventeen MPLAsponsored                            applications for Cuban technicians in such areas as fishing industry                            and agriculture He told the MPLA that                            the number seemed excessive and he told me he plans to sit on the Cuban                            applications for the duration I asked about Russian advisors He has                            seen no visa applications since he took over the function but he does                            not know how many if any are in the country nor does he have any way of                            checking applications using phony passports10 In light of the charges made by President Mobutu that the Portuguese military                            are handing over arms to the MPLA I                            asked Cardoso what the                            Portuguese do with their arms when they leave an area of Angola They                            take them with them he replied The only weapons that have gone to the                            liberation movements he said were those that were given when the                            movements seconded troops to the integrated forces provided for in the                            Alvor Agreement When the Portuguese left Malange and Luso they came out                            loaded with arms he said UNITA                            unhitched the locomotive from the cars carrying the troops from Luso and                            stole their weapons but the point is the Portuguese do take all arms                            ammunition and vehicles with them when they pull out They leave behind                            office equipment kitchens bedding and other bulky items not worth                            transporting On independence the GOP                            will transfer to Angolan Government twentyeight vessels and some old                            planes jets and helicopters will be removed to Portugal11 What about efforts to bring about an MPLAUNITA coalition in                            the government Cardoso said                            that both movements are playing a waiting game MPLA keeps threatening UDI while maintaining its military                            offensive in order to force UNITA to                            capitulate before independence UNITA                            for its part is trying to regain enough territory to be able to force                            the MPLA to negotiate its UNITAs entry into the government                            rather than having to capitulate to MPLA demands Cardoso believes within a few weeks of independence                            probably by October 20 UNITA he                            added is anxious for the Portuguese military and the whites to leave                            Nova Lisboa in order to be able to use the airport to bring in arms The                            fields it is now using at Silva                            Porto and Serpa Pinto are not adequate for large planes and not close                            enough to crucial areas to allow the rapid deployment of the weapons now                            available to UNITA The sooner the                            airlift of refugees from Nova Lisboa is completed he said the happier                                Savimbi will be12 Comment: I can vouch for a number of things                                Cardoso told me The                            animosity between the Portuguese military and the MPLA is growing and I give little to stories put out by                                Mobutu Holden Roberto Savimbi or anyone else that the                            Portuguese are aiding the MPLA All of                            the troop commanders I have met here are antiMPLA and it is a good thing they are because the aggressive                            actions against Portuguese troops by FNLA and UNITA soldiers                            would have otherwise driven the former toward MPLA had it not been for MPLAs provocations against the Portuguese Neither FNLA or UNITA want to admit that their old adversary the MPLA is a better fighting force than                            either of them hence the charges that the Portuguese are responsible                            Even that most antiMPLA High                            Commissioner General Antonio da                                SilvaCardoso considered the FNLA to be a bunch of corrupt imbeciles                            who could not find their way from Caxito to Luanda with a compass and a                            road map I realize that US officials talk with FNLA and UNITA leaders and their supporters and that it is difficult                            to obtain from the outside an appreciation of what is going on inside                            Angola but I hope all will keep in mind that MPLA has the edge at this time because it is better                            organized than its adversaries Has received large amounts of weapons                            from the Soviet Union and possesses capable leadership The Portuguese                            have had nothing to do with MPLA gains                            in recent months For that matter if it were not for the Portuguese                                Savimbi would still be                            stumbling about in the bush with a few guerrillas13 I have known Cardoso since I                            arrived here a little over a year ago and I believe him to be as neutral                            as he says he is Still his job is to try and get Portugal out of here                            on November 11 if he possibly can The Portuguese want to leave with                            honor and claim they will not submit to MPLA demands The Admirals idea of sitting in his chair                            after independence like Sewell Avery is admirable but the MPLA is likely to carry him out and I                            doubt the Portuguese will mind very much14 I trust no one in this dramanot the Portuguese who have no will                            not the MPLA which has no scruples                            not the FNLA which has no sense and                            not UNITA which has no power at                            least for the moment All of the factors driving the leaders of the                            three liberation movements are negativehate greed ambitionand the                            final solution in Angola has to be by force of arms The denouement will                            come after independence and it will be bloodyKilloran	19750925

thoughts                        on an issue of great importance to relations between developed and                        developing countries and to the economic wellbeing of our two countries                        and all the nations of the worldSince the consumerproducer preparatory meeting in Paris last April the                        United States has made a major effort to reestablish a basis for dialogue                        and cooperation between the nations of the developing world including those                        which export oil and the industrialized nations We have undertaken a                        fundamental review of our overall policy toward the developing countries This review has                        resulted in a new approach to the producerconsumer dialogue that responds                        more fully to these nations concerns particularly those raised by your                        governments representatives and other delegations during the Paris meeting                        Since Secretary Kissinger                        articulated the general outlines of this approach in speeches in Kansas City                        and Paris in May we have made much progress in establishing the                        constructive understandings necessary to promote further mutually beneficial                        cooperation not only between our two nations but among the broader world                        community Furthermore as you know we have made a number of important                        specific proposals for cooperation at the current Special Session of the                        United Nations General AssemblyA key paragraph                            of Kissingers address before                            the Seventh Special Session of the UN                            General Assembly on September 1 as read by Moynihan reads: These economic issues have already                            become the subject of mounting confrontationembargoes cartels                            seizures countermeasuresand bitter rhetoric Over the remainder of                            this century should this trend continue the division of the planet                            between North and South between rich and poor could become as grim as                            the darkest days of the cold war We would enter an age of festering                            resentment increased resort to economic warfare a hardening of new                            blocs the undermining of cooperation the erosion of international                            institutionsand failed development    Can we reconcile our competing                            goals Can we build a better world by conscious purpose out of the                            equality and cooperation of states The speech is printed in Department                            of State Bulletin September 22 1975 pp

             between the industrial and developing nations We are pleased that our                        efforts and those of your government and others have succeeded in                        establishing a consensus for resuming these discussions Over the past                        months we have clearly demonstrated our commitment to a constructive                        dialogue and our belief that its success requires each participant to                        recognize and take full account of the vital interests of the othersAs you can appreciate the support of the American public for the new US position must be based on an awareness of                        the concerns of the oil producers and other developing countries and the                        need to seek cooperative solutions to our common economic problems I am                        concerned however that this necessary support will be jeopardized should                        the member countries of OPEC increase the                        price of oil this fallI am also concerned that such action could raise serious questions among the                        American public regarding the close cooperation we seek and are actively                        developing with your country in several fields of our bilateral                        relationship I value this relationship greatly and sincerely wish to                        continue to broaden and deepen itAnother oil price increase by OPEC would                        also have a significant negative impact on the economies of all the oil                        importing nationsboth developed                        and developingat the very time that signs of progress in the fight against                        recession and inflation are appearing Such a price increase would impose                        shocks on the US economy on the more vulnerable economies of Europe and                        Japan and finally on the highly fragile economies of the developing world                        It would at the very least reduce the progress toward economic recovery and                        could in fact plunge a number of countries into extremely serious                        difficultiesIt is because I am aware Your Majesty of your sensitivity to the                        interdependence of the world economy and your commitment to a successful                        economic dialogue that I am asking you to weigh heavily the adverse                        effectsboth psychological and realwhich a price increase could have It is                        my hope that you will use your considerable influence among the producing                        countries to urge restraint on oil prices and to argue that our longterm                        mutual interest in a more rational global economic structure should prevail                        over shortterm economic advantage Sincerely Gerald R

average nearly equals                            the government take of the oil producing nations can very well be                            adjusted to take care of any increase in oil prices

frus1969-76v37d82	82 Telegram From the Department of State to Selected Diplomatic Posts	None	1975-09-12 21:22:00	None	None	217382 For the Ambassador Beirut pass Baghdad Immediate Subject: OPEC Oil Price Decision1 OPEC Ministers will meet in Vienna                        September 24 to consider an oil price increase We believe that a price                        increase is unjustified Although the increased cost of manufactured and                        other goods is usually cited within OPEC                        as justification for increased oil prices the oil price increases beginning                        in 1973 have so exceeded increases in prices of manufactures that their                        price relationships are disproportionately changed by a substantial margin                        According to our analysis from a 1960 base period per barrel revenue on                            OPEC marker crude Saudi Arabian                        light rose over 1200 percent to mid1975 compared with an increase of slightly more than 100 percent in                        the price of manufactured exports as computed by the UN From January 1 1973 to mid1975 revenue on marker crude                        increased 566 percent as against slightly more than a 52 percent increase in                        the price of manufactured exports The first half of 1974 was admittedly a                        period of massive price increases throughout the world economy However                        since that time the pace of price increases in manufactured goods has slowed                        significantly and prices of many agricultural and other commodities have                        dropped As a result the purchasing power of oil exports appears to have                        been about constant from mid1974 to mid1975 However such statistical                        comparisons have not succeeded in swaying the producers in the past two                        years It now appears likely that OPECs                        actual decision on prices will largely depend on the producers perception                        of their own requirements and of what the market will bear ie the degree                        to which a price increase might diminish demand for OPEC oil and the combined effect on OPEC revenues2 We are concerned with the adverse economic and psychological effects of an                            OPEC oil price increase The incipient                        world economic recovery would be hindered inflation would be exacerbated                        and the cooperative atmosphere needed for the resumed producerconsumer                        dialogue would be jeopardized We wish to make our concerns clear to the                            OPEC countries Secretary Kissinger again publicly opposed an                        increase in his September 1 address to the UN Special Session

following points with such additional details as are                        deemed effective in the host country situation:A Since the producerconsumer preparatory meeting in Paris last April the                        United States has made a major effort to reestablish a basis for dialogue                        and greater cooperation between the developing countries and the                        industrialized countries We reviewed our overall policy toward the                        developing countries We took into account the concerns expressed by the                        developing country representatives at the Prepcon Secretary Kissinger articulated our new approach in speeches in Kansas                        City and Paris in May and outlined in detail both our general approach and                        specific proposals on September 1 in his address to the Seventh Special                        Session of the United Nations General Assembly This US commitment to a cooperative and innovative approach to the                        problems of global development is based on our conviction that all parties                        to this dialogue must take into account the important interests and concerns                        of others In this regard we                        believe that the governments of OPEC have                        a responsibility to take account of the effect which any further increase in                        the price of oil will have in the world economy and prospects for success in                        the current effort to build a new approach to the problems of economic                        development and cooperationB In the case of the US we are concerned                        about our ability to maintain public support for a forthcoming and                        cooperative approach to the problems of international economic development                        and the producerconsumer dialogue should the member countries of OPEC increase the price of oil again                        Americans can see no justification for a further increase when the                        purchasing power of oil has already risen so disproportionately as a result                        of past increases Our commitment to a forthcoming and cooperative approach                        to global economic problems would of course remain but in a practical sense                        our ability to explore specific new approaches might be jeopardizedC Recession in the industrialized countries is adversely affecting the                        global economy in 1975 including the level of earnings of the oil producing                        nations as a group A further OPEC price                        increase would reduce the resources and worsen the payments balance of all                        oil importing countriesboth developed and developingjust as progress in                        the fight against recession and inflation has become apparent A price                        increase would at the very least reduce the progress toward recovery in the                        United States and it could plunge some countries into extremely serious                        difficultiesD We trust that the member countries of OPEC will give proper recognition to our concerns and to the                        possible consequences of an oil price increasenot least of which is                        hindrance of progress toward a more rational and prospering global economic                            structureDespite these dmarches the                                OPEC Ministers agreed at the                            meeting in Vienna to a 10 percent price increase for the next 9 months                            The price of marker crude would remain at 1151 until July 1 1976                            Telegram 8283 from Vienna September 27 National Archives RG 59 Central

conference2 To assist our preparations for this meeting action addressees are                        requested to approach host government at appropriate levels to seek its                        views on the following issues:A Site for Ministeriallevel conference Group of seven meeting in                        midAugust indicated preference for Geneva or ParisThe group of seven LDCOPEC

learned today that Austrians have decided to                        offer Vienna as site for conference Austria is also prepared to chair                        Ministerial but will not press for chairmanship as GOA considers having                        Vienna as site for conference more importantB Chairman: Group of seven consensus at August Geneva caucus favored                        neutral personality which could even come from one of participants in the                        conference US believes we should adopt same                        balanced approach the Ten have agreed to for the commissions and favors                        rotatating cochairman selected by each side from amongst participantsC Secretariat: We wish to minimize institutional structure at this early                        point in the dialogue Therefore we favor limiting secretariat to small                        temporary group providing technical services only such as interpreting                        translation of documents distribution and other housekeeping functionsD Site S for commission meetings: This issue has not been discussed by                        either side and US has not yet formulated a                        position Obviously discussion of this question must await conclusion on                        chairmanship and site issues however we would appreciate indication of                        views on this questionTelegram 231097                            September 28 informed the same addressees as this telegram that the

commissions with the right to speak In oral                        statement by French it was indicated that both IEA and OPEC would be invited                        to participate in energy commission At August meeting of group of seven in                        Geneva consensus emerged favoring right of any nation participating in                        conference to observe commissions work Commissions will be limited to 15                        members Obviously right of all countries to sit in on work of commissions                        could vitiate purpose of limiting size of commissions and we would oppose                        this USG has no fixed views on observer                        organizations in other commissions except for IEA in energy commission We welcome views of host governments                        What organizations do they envisage for each commissionF Agenda: There has been no discussion of an agenda for the Ministerial                        conference Participants will recall difficult negotiations on this issue at                        April meeting which we are anxious to avoid We believe agenda for                        conference should be short and noncontroversialG Terms of reference for commissions: Consensus contains broad general                        statement regarding scope of commissions tasks Does host government                        envisage broadening these general descriptions or including more detailed                        guidance at conference or is it agreeable to letting each commission                        determine work program for itself To avoid controversy on this potentially                        difficult question at Prepcon US would prefer latter approach3 IEA Governing Board will meet October 10                        to develop consensus on above issuesRegarding                            the second Prepcon the IEA Governing Board at its October 10                            meeting agreed on a common position on all anticipated procedural                            issues The US representative on the Board proposed that the IEA demonstrate greater interest in the                            energy problem of nonoil LDCs by adopting program to deal with these                            problems The Board also debated the future work of the Agency and                            reached the consensus that the IEA                            should continue to concentrate on development of LongTerm Program                            which will establish a comprehensive
