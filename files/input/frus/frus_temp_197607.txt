UNPALATABLE EPMG ACTIONS                            IT IS TEMPTING TO SOME TO ASSUME THAT EPMG ACTIONS AGAINST USG INTERESTS OR THAT ARE DESTRUCTIVE TO                                USG PROGRAMS ARE DELIBERATELY                            CONSIDERED POLICY ACTS THAT WILL CONTINUE AND INTENSIFY FROM SUCH                            ASSUMPTIONS IT IS POSSIBLE TO BUILD SCENARIOS THAT REQUIRE

   IMPORTANT TO USG ANDOR ACTIONS                            DESTRUCTIVE TO USG PROGRAMS AND THAT SOMETIMES US COUNTERREACTION IS                            NECESSARY HOWEVER UNDERSTANDABLE IRRITATION

 AND CONTINUING THE PRESENT POLICY OF STEADINESS8 THE TIME MAY COME WHEN OVERALL USEMPG RELATIONS ARE SO INTOLERABLE                            POOR THAT SHARP USG RETALIATION IS                            REQUIRED PERHAPS INHUMANE ACTIONS AGAINST LOCAL CITIZENS OR MILITARY                            ATTACKS AGAINST ETHIOPIAS NEIGHBORS COULD REQUIRE A FULL SCALE                            REASSESSMENT OF US POLICIES AND PROGRAMS UNTIL SUCH EVENTS OCCUR IT                            WOULD BE WRONG TO CHANGE PRESENT US POLICIES I FOR ONE BELIEVE THAT                            HOWEVER IRRATIONAL AND PROCOMMUNIST THE EPMG MAY APPEAR AT PRESENT IT IS NOT SUICIDAL AND IT WILL                            FACE UP TO HARD FACTS ONE SUCH FACT THAT IS GETTING INCREASING EPMG ATTENTION IS THAT BOTH SOVIET BLOC                            AND PRC ARE FAILING TO SUPPLY INPUTS                            MILITARY AND ECONOMIC ANYWHERE NEAR THE MAGNITUDE OF THOSE FROM THE                            WEST EVERY EDUCATED ETHIOPIAN WHETHER LEFTIDEOLOGUE OR MODERATE                            UNDERSTANDS THAT VERY LARGE FOREIGN INPUTS ARE REQUIRED JUST FOR                            SURVIVAL LET ALONE FOR DEVELOPMENTAL PROGRESS HAVING DEMONSTRABLY                            FAILED TO GET THOSE INPUTS FROM SOCIALIST FRIENDS THERE IS A GOOD                            CHANCE THEY WILL

THAT GISCARD MAKES DECISIONS CONCERNING                            AFRICAN POLICY WITHOUT CONSULTING THOSE WHO MANAGE EXISTING                            PROGRAMS6 OBJECTIVES: THE OBJECTIVES OF THE

GOALS MIGHT RULE OUT ASSISTANCE                            TO OTHER COUNTRIES WHICH FRANCE FOR POLITICAL REASONS WISHES TO FAVOR                            INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT AND TRANSFER OF

      CENTRAL AFRICA WHERE FORMER FRENCH COLONIES PREDOMINATE BUT ALSO HOPES                            THAT THE FUND WILL OPEN NEW DOORS FOR THE DONOR COUNTRIES POLITICALLY

PRINCIPAL MOTIVATION FOR THE                            NEW FUND WOULD BE POLITICAL FRANCE HOPES THAT THE NEW ORGANIZATION                            WOULD BE FLEXIBLE ENOUGH TO ALLOW THE CHOICE OF AID RECIPIENTS AND PROJECTS TO BE MADE WITH MINIMAL                            BUREAUCRATIC DIFFICULTY AND WITHOUT RIGID ECONOMIC CRITERIA CONCERNING                            COSTS AND BENEFITS BUT EXACTLY HOW A POLITICAL FOCUS AND SIMPLE                            ADMINISTRATIVE FUNCTIONING OF THE FUND COULD BE MAINTAINED HAS NOT BEEN                            MADE CLEAR9 STRUCTURE FUNDING: TWO BASIC INSTITUTIONS WERE PRO POSED AS THE                            ORGANIZATIONAL CORE OF THE FUND: A COUNCIL OF DONORS WHICH FRANCE HAS                            VOLUNTEERED TO ORGANIZE AND A COUNCIL OF RECIPIENTS POLICY WOULD BE                            DETERMINED THROUGH JOINT DISCUSSIONS OF THE TWO COUNCILS AS OUTLINED BY                            THE FRENCH AT A JULY MEETING OF POTENTIAL DONOR COUNTRIES THE INITIAL                            CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE FUND SHOULD TOTAL DOL 1 BILLION FOR A FIVEYEAR                            PERIOD ALTHOUGH CONTRIBUTIONS WOULD BE

OTHER                            INDUSTRIALIZED DEMOCRACIES MIGHT BE INVITED TO JOIN LATER GISCARD HAD                            EARLIER SUGGESTED TO THE UNITED STATES THAT LOAN GUARANTEES AND INTEREST                            RATE SUBSIDIES BE MAJOR PARTS OF THE FUNDS PROGRAM10 REACTIONS: EUROPEAN REACTION TO THE FRENCH PROPOSALS HAS BEEN                            DECIDEDLY UNENTHUSIASTIC INITIALLY INDICATING ANNOYANCE THAT FRANCE HAD                            HELD PRIOR CONSULTATIONS ONLY WITH THE UNITED STATES AND NOT WITH ITS                            PARTNERS IN THE EUROPEAN ECONOMIC COMMUNITY BOTH THE GERMANS AND THE                            BRITISH HAVE BEEN PESSIMISTIC ABOUT THEIR ABILITY TO PROVIDE ANY NEW                            FUNDS FOR AFRICAN AID ALTHOUGH                            REALLOCATION OF PREVIOUSLY COMMITTED FUNDS MIGHT BE POSSIBLE THE                            EUROPEANS ARE ALSO LIKELY TO ARGUE THAT THEY ARE ALREADY MAKING                            SUBSTANTIAL CONTRIBUTIONS TO AFRICA THROUGH THE ECONOMIC COMMUNITYS                            EUROPEAN DEVELOPMENT FUND AND OTHER FUNDS AND THAT THESE IN THEIR VIEW                            INDIRECTLY PROVIDE FRANCE WITH CONSIDERABLE ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL                            BENEFITS SOME OFFICIALS ARE CONCERNED THAT THE SPECIAL FUND WOULD                            DUPLICATE THE FUNCTIONS OF THE EUROPEAN DEVELOPMENT FUND WITHOUT                            PROVIDING ANY ADDITIONAL POLITICAL BENEFITS AND WOULD BE COMPETITIVE                            WITH THE AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT FUND OF THE AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK TO                            WHICH ALL EUROPEAN DONORS EXCEPT FRANCE ALREADY CONTRIBUTE OTHERS                            SPECULATE THAT THE FUND PROPOSAL IS ACTUALLY AN ATTEMPT TO SPREAD THE                            BURDEN OF FRANCES ALREADY SIZABLE AFRICAN COMMITMENTS11 CONFUSION ABOUT FRENCH MOTIVATIONS IS HEIGHTENED BY THE FACT THAT                            FRANCE HAD PREVIOUSLY OPPOSED THE ESTABLISHMENT OF NEW MULTILATERAL                            ORGANIZATIONS EG THE INTERNATIONAL RESOURCES BANK WHILE SHOWING                            INTEREST IN OTHER VENTURES OF UNCLEAR FUNCTION THE FRANCOAFRICAN                            SOLIDARITY FUND FOR EXAMPLE PROPOSED AT THE FRENCHAFRICAN SUMMIT AT                            BANGUI IN MARCH 1975 AND APPROVED AT THE MAY 1976 SUMMIT COULD BE USED                            FOR THE SAME GENERAL PURPOSE AS THE MUCH LARGER PROPOSED NEW                            MULTILATERAL FUND FURTHERMORE FRANCE SO FAR HAS NOT CONTRIBUTED TO THE                            AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT FUND OR THE INTERNATIONAL FUND FOR AGRICULTURAL                            DEVELOPMENT BECAUSE IT HAS NOT BEEN ABLE TO DECIDE THE SIZE OF ITS                            CONTRIBUTION12 THE AFRICANS AT THE SUMMIT WARMLY RECEIVED THE FRENCH PROPOSALS BUT                            ALSO HAD MANY QUESTIONS ABOUT THE PROGRAMS IMPLEMENTATION FRENCH                            OFFICIALS BELIEVE THAT AFRICAN EXPECTATIONS ABOUT THE FUND HAVE NOT YET                            BEEN AROUSED AND THEY DO NOT WISH TO ENCOURAGE SUCH EXPECTATIONS UNTIL                            PLANS BECOME MUCH FIRMER13 IN SPITE OF THE FINANCIAL AND POLITICAL CONSTRAINTS ON THE EUROPEAN                            PARTNERS THE FRENCH ARE OPTIMISTIC THAT GIVEN GISCARDS STRONG                            PERSONAL COMMITMENT THE EUROPEANS AND THE AMERICANS WILL GO ALONG                            WITH SOME VERSION OF THEPROGRAM AT THE MOMENT HOWEVER NO ONE INCLUDING MOST FRENCH OFFICIALS                            HAS A CLEAR IDEA OF EXACTLY WHAT GISCARD HAS IN MIND THE FRENCH WILL
