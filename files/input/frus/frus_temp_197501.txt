Offensive in South Vietnam Ref: A Saigon 0221 B Saigon                                0231Telegram 221 from Saigon January                                8 contained the text of the South Vietnamese declaration on the                                fall of Phuoc Long Ibid Telegram 231 from Saigon January 8                                contained the text of the South Vietnamese note to the ICRC UNHCR UNICEF and                                the League of Red Cross Societies requesting assistance for the                                humanitarian emergency in Phuoc Long Province Ibid1 With the fall on January 7 of Phuoc Long Province and its capital to                            North Vietnamese troops we have arrived at a turning point in the                            history of the Paris Agreement What has so long been clear to us within                            the government and to perceptive observers outside is now clear beyond                            any possible doubt to the whole world: in the cynical belief that no one                            outside South Vietnam really cares North Vietnam in open defiance of                            the Agreement is determined to use whatever military force is required                            to gain its objective of conquering SVN                            The US reaction to the North Vietnamese                            conquest of Phuoc Long Province is thus of critical importance for the                            success or failure of our policy in Indochina2 The GVN firmly believes that we are in                            a new situation which calls for a stronger better organized diplomatic                            and public relations response than in the past to Hanoi challenges and                            we have been in close consultation as to how we can improve our joint                            efforts The GVN declaration of January                            8 which was read to the Diplomatic Corps and briefed to the press ref                            A and the GVN appeal for relief                            assistance to UN agencies ref B are the                            first in a series of moves under consideration We will report further                            as their plans take shape3 As for steps which the US should take                            we urge first of all that a statement be made from a high level from                            the White House if possible emphasizing the gravity with which the                                US views North Vietnamese actions                            While Ambassador Andersons                            comments January 3Department of State                                spokesman Robert Anderson                                condemned the attack during a press briefing January 4 The New York Times January 5 1975                            were helpful so far as they went we are now in a situation in which an                            entire province together with its capital has been seized Anything                            short of a high level official statement of the United States position                            would appear here and at home as virtual connivance in North Vietnams                            actions We heard in Saigon this morning on Dao Radio relay of a broadcast by Marvin Kalb                            saying that peace never came to Vietnam that this was only another of                                Nixons lies and that the                            Paris Agreement was a contrived lull to get American forces out and to                            allow for a decent interval before the North Vietnamese take over Kalb                            went on to say that although Washington makes perfunctory statements no                            senior official has spoken out and that in the State Department                            officials are actually relieved that Congress has imposed restraints                            Net result said Kalb is that while a lot of people are yet to die a                            Communist takeover is inevitable This all is of course a gross                            misinterpretation of our governments position but this kind of talk is                            bound to be increasingly heard unless rpt unless we make declarations and take actions which                            palpably demonstrate that we view Hanois challenge for what it isa                            deliberate effort to destroy that for which so many Americans sacrificed                            so muchthe right of the South Vietnamese to freely choose their own                            form of government4 Second We must circularize a note to the parties to the Act of the                            Paris Conference which we would also make public in which we note that                            we take the gravest view of Hanois violations of the Paris Agreement                            over the past two yearsSee footnote 5 Document 156 The Department                                of State released the text of the note on January 13 The New York Times January 14 1975                            We believe Hanoi must cease its offensive actions disgorge its captured                            territories and tell its southern branch the PRG to return to the negotiating table in Paris and                            Saigon We would ask each recipient to make a public statement                            supporting our position and a dmarche to Hanoi asking it to cease its                            military offensive and abide by the Paris Agreement We also recommend                            that we ask all friendly governments having diplomatic relations with                            Hanoi such as Australia Holland India Indonesia Sweden to make a                            similar approach to the DRV5 But most important of all the things which must be done is for the                            Department to mount a campaign to bring the whole truth to the American                            people about the current realities in Vietnam Only by such a concerted                            effort can we overcome the deliberate organized campaign of lies and                            distortions about Vietnam which Don Luce Fred Branfman and their                            colleagues in the Indochina Resources Center are conducting to discredit                            our Vietnam policy and persuade the Congress to reject it For this                            purpose we believe there must be set up within the Department a task                            force under a leader with the sole mandate to get out to the American                            people the whole truth about Vietnam The Department has ample resources                            to accomplish this Among the more obvious actions that we should now be                            taking is an organized speakers program directed to important fora to                            ensure media play to ensure that our policy and the situation on which it is based is explained by                            ranking Department officials to the public This is to be followed up by                            lower ranking officers visiting college campuses schools churches                            foreign affairs oriented clubs and institutions and anywhere people                            interested in foreign affairs get together Some notion of how to start                            could be gained by looking at the itinerary of Indochina Resources                            Center speakers The Department itself is of course well aware of the                            many capabilities at its disposal which could be used in this work6 We must set the above actions in motion soon and especially we must                            launch our campaign of truth about Vietnam as soon as possible in order                            to preempt the plan of Don Luce and company to stage a propaganda                            carnival in commemoration of the January 27 second anniversary of the                            Paris AgreementMartin	19750108

President                                Thieu personally handed Ambassador letter addressed to                                President Ford text of which                            given below President Thieu told                            Ambassador he did not intend to make the letter public but that                                President Ford should feel                            free to do so if he thought                            this would be useful At the same time Foreign Minister Bac has sent the Ambassador a copy of                                President Thieus letter for                            forwarding to Secretary Kissinger Original being pouched Department2 Begin text:Dear Mr President:As we are approaching the second anniversary of the signing of the Paris                            Agreement of 27 January 1973 I wish to draw your attention to the very                            grave situation our country is facing as a result of the continuing                            aggression carried out by North Vietnamese troops in South VietNamIndeed during the last two years and despite the existence of the Paris                            Agreement North VietNam has vastly increased its military capability                            in the south stepped up land and population grabbing operations and                            launched incessant attacks against outposts bases district towns which                            were indisputably under the jurisdiction and control of our government                            long before the Paris Agreement was concluded The recent capture of the                            PhuocLong Province last weekcertainly the most massive and the most                            blatant violation of the Paris Agreementclearly shows that the North                            Vietnamese and their political instrument in the south the National                            Liberation Front have completely disregarded the agreement It is                            quite evident by now that North VietNam instead of seeking a political                            solution within the framework of the Paris Agreement has again resorted                            to military adentures to impose their will over South VietNamYou are certainly aware Mr President that this continued aggression                            from North VietNam constitutes a most serious threat to the survival of                            South VietNam as a free and independent country and destroys the chance                            for the South Vietnamese people to exercise their right of                            selfdetermination a principle for the defense of which more than fifty                            thousand young Americans as well as hundreds of thousands of Vietnamese                            had sacrificed their lives To uphold this principle our troops have                            fought gallantly and well and since the withdrawal of all allied troops                            they have shown determination and ability to go forward alone to                            preserve our independence and freedomNevertheless as North VietNam continues to receive large quantities of                            war material from Communist countries to pursue their armed aggression                            against South VietNam we must rely on the assistance of the United                            States of America for the supply of equipment and ammunition necessary                            to our defence In most cases we have sustained setbacks solely because                            of the Communist massive application of fire power and armor on our                            side our troops had to count every single shell they fire in order to                            make the ammunition lastI understand that some sections of the American public opinion have been                            induced into believing that too much aid to the Republic of VietNam would only prolong the                            war and encourage us not to seek a political solution The record                            clearly shows the opposite Reduction of military assistance to VietNam                            by the US Congress has only encouraged the Communists Thus they have                            broken off all the negotiations in Saigon as well as in Paris and                            systematically rejected all our proposals for general elections Taking                            advantage of the scarcity of our supplies and hoping that adequate aid                            for us will not be forthcoming they are once again undertaking to                            destroy our government structure by force of arms with a view of                            imposing a solution of their ownTwo years ago we signed the Paris Agreement with the hope that the                            elaborate structure for global peace would effectively work We also                            signed with the great conviction that should the Communists resort to                            the use of force again we will be provided with adequate means to defend                            ourselvesToday I wish to appeal to you to take all necessary action to preserve                            the Paris Agreement I am aware of and thankful for the numerous                            personal efforts and intervention you have made in our behalf since you                            took over the highest office of your great country I am also very                            heartened by your decision last week to seek more supplemental military                            assistance for the Republic of VietNamI hope that you will be successful in convincing the United States                            Congress and the American people that the cutbacks and restrictions in                            aid to the Republic of VietNam could undermine its very survival and                            eventually make a mockery of the commitment of the United States to the                            defence of peace in VietNamI trust that you and the Secretary of State will not spare any effort to                            preserve the Paris Agreement and to ensure that the countless sacrifices                            that our two nations have made will not be made in vainSincerely yoursNguyen Van ThieuEnd

   Week interview1 Please pass to Shah of Iran the following message from the Secretary2 Begin text:Your Imperial Majesty:There has been considerable public speculation regarding the remarks I made                        about oil in the interview I gave recently to Business                            WeekOn January 3 The New York Times reported that Kissinger in an interview with Business Week magazine shortly before Christmas said that he                            could not rule out the use of force against oilproducing nations The                            article entitled Kissinger on                            Oil Food and Trade appeared in the January 13 edition of Business Week pp 6676 The transcript of the                            interview is printed in the Department of State Bulletin January 27 1975 pp 97106 I would like                        you to have these further comments from me directly so that you will                        understand the context and intent of my remarksAs you will have noted from the text of the interview the question of the                        possible use of force came up with specific relation to oil prices I sought                        to make it clear that we did not consider military action to be an                        appropriate response to the problem of oil prices I also specifically                        rejected the thought which some have suggested that massive political                        warfare might be used against Iran or other of our friends in order to bring                        prices down immediatelySince the interviewer had raised the possibility of some sort of military                        action as an answer to the oil problem I had to respond to that point You                        will have seen from examining the text that I did so in the context of a                        hypothetical situation in which there was some deliberate attempt to                        strangle the industrial worldIn response to the                            question of whether he had considered military action on oil prices                                Kissinger said that it would                            be a very dangerous course: I am not saying that theres no                            circumstance where we would not use force But it is one thing to use it                            in the case of a dispute over price its another where theres some                            actual strangulation of the industrialized world He added that force                            would be considered only in the gravest emergency Although I                        did not say so explicitly in the interview I think such a situation could                        arise if there were a prolonged embargo by oil exporting countries                        constituting a grave act of                        economic warfare In the interview itself I sought to deal frankly and                        realistically with this question and therefore could not rule out military                        action under any and all future circumstances At the same time I made it                        very clear that the use of force would be considered only in the gravest                        national emergency In commenting to the press here last week I said I did                        not foresee such a situation arisingKissingers January 3 comments to the                            press were reported in The New York Times                            January 4 1975It is my hope Your Majesty that my remarks will serve to put this issue in                        some perspective because there has been a lot of loose talk around the world                        about possible military action as the way to resolve the oil problemTelegram 363 from Tehran January 14 reported on                            the articles circulating in the Iranian press alleging that the                            Secretary had threatened oil producers with the use of force National                            Archives RG 59 Central Foreign Policy                            Files D7500131197In any event while we indeed would have to take a very serious view of an                        effort to bring down the industrialized world by shutting off oil supplies                        the reference was of course to last years oil embargo and current                        speculation about a future embargo in which Iran has had no part My                        remarks were in no sense directed at Iran Beyond that you are well aware                        of the very high esteem in which Your Majesty is held by President Forda feeling which you know I share

  continuing rigidity in insisting that there can be only one body to the                        exclusion of all others to deal with the whole range of agricultural issues

balance among                        all aspects of MTNs It is clearly important to satisfactory resolution of                            agricultureMTN issue that EC Ministers meeting February 10 result in                        sufficient flexibility to avoid rigid formulation re MTN structure4 For US Mission EC                            Brussels: Ambassador should at earliest opportunity approach                            Soames and make following                        points:A EC US and world trading community will be                        losers particularly in current international economic situation if                        longawaited MTN bogs down right at the                        start over issue related to procedures of negotiation Temptation to resort                        to unilateral restrictive measures and destructive bilateralism can only be                        intensified by such a resultB US Trade Act Sec 103 states that to the maximum extent feasible the                        harmonization reduction or elimination of agricultural trade barriers and                        distortions shall be undertaken in conjunction with the harmonization                        reduction or elimination of industrial trade barriers and distortions                        Need for US to obtain package in MTNs which includes agriculture is clear                        Congressional and US agricultural community interest in negotiation as per                        Section 135 of Trade Act insure almost immediate political repercussions in                        US if there suspicion that it EC intention to                        exclude agriculture by insisting from outset on a structure which led to                        limited negotiations in agriculture in Kennedy RoundC EC has also spoken of need for balance in                        negotiations The representative of the European Economic Community                        concluded by saying that of course the Community did not intend to isolate                        the negotiations on agricultural products from the rest of the negotiations                        In this connection in conformity with the positions it had taken and its                        undertakings and in particular with the Tokyo Declaration of Ministers the                        Community considered the multilateral negotiations to be a whole the                        various elements of which shall move forward together and the reciprocity                        it was seeking would be judged on an overall basis MTNP2 March 4 1974 If we to take EC statement at face value we find it difficult                        to understand why they are rigidly adhering to a position on structure which                        will make it virtually impossible move all elements forward together and                        which brings about USEC confrontationD We clearly need develop MTN structure                        which is most likely to achieve above aims US mandate in form of Section                        103 of Trade Act permits us                        approach problem on flexible pragmatic basis designed achieve this result                        providing EC mandate is also flexible in this                        direction It is therefore important that EC                        mandate allow flexibility in this area as contrasted to present rigid                        formulation now being considered by EC and                        cited by EC spokesman as likely outcome of                        February 10 Council meetingE If asked about US initiative on grain reserves discussions initial                        meeting scheduled for February 1011 in London you may say that focus of                        these discussions is on food security To extent that trade issues emerge                        these will need to be related to MTN with                        nature of relationship open to discussion in reserves and TNC meetingsF We strongly urge Soames to use his                        personal offices in working for a flexible EC                        mandate which will allow us to find mutually acceptable solution and avoid                        impasse which is in neither US or EC                        interest5 Mission may assure Soames that we                        will do our utmost keep issue out of the public domain We are however                        given time pressures also raising this issue in EC capitals with the expectation that this will support efforts                        on his part We would be prepared to try to resolve structural issue in a                        way which prejudices neither EC or US                        positions on final outcome of negotiations6 Other action addressees should approach appropriate high level host                        government officials drawing on points in

tailored to known views of host government For instance Bonn and                        London could refer to German and British interest in improvement in EC agricultural policies which might possibly                        result from MTN negotiations and the concern                        that any separate agricultural group risks being dominated by LDC interests Dublin may wish note that                        current Irish chairmanship of EC Council                        provides them opportunity to use their influence in seeking satisfactory                        resolution

result attention media have given Secretarys message and in                        awareness of sensitivities of other OPEC                        states such as those noted in reftels action addressees are at their                        discretion authorized to make oral approach to their host governments at                        appropriately high level and to leave following aidemmoire:3 Following standard opening: Ever since the start of the energy crisis and                        the Washington Energy Conference many governments including the United                        States have felt that it would be useful at the right time and with the                        right preparations to supplement the intensive bilateral consultations that                        now exist between oil producing and oil consuming countries with some form                        of multilateral dialogue4 Recent discussions between the United States and France in Martinique                        resulted in an agreement on a possible timetable and approach to such                        multilateral contacts a proposal which has now been endorsed by the members                        of the International Energy Agency Under this approach there would be a                        four phase schedule: first basic decisions by the consumers on                        conservation development of new sources of energy and financial solidarity                        second a meeting among representatives of producers and consumers to                        discuss the procedures and agenda for a conference third intensive                        preparation of common positions for that conference and fourth the                        conference itself5 Particular stress has been placed on the need for major energy and                        financial decisions by the consuming countries in advance of the proposed                        conference because a failed conference would be seriously detrimental to                        all consumers and producers alike That is also a view expressed by many                        representatives of producing countries who have repeatedly stressed the                        importance of conservation of energy the development of new sources and                        financial stabilization6 Although preparation among consumers is thus necessary in advance it                        should be stressed that the objective is cooperation not confrontation It                        is not intended that all contacts between producers and consumers be                        conducted as a bloc to bloc dialogue On the contrary the United States would like to strengthen its                        bilateral contacts with oil producing governments over the coming months so                        that cooperative efforts to solve the international oil crisis can be made                        more effective7 President Ford is now completing                        a series of major decisions on domestic energy policy These decisions will                        be announced in January They are expected to make a significant                        contribution to the solution of the world energy problem8 Over the coming months the Government of the United States looks forward                        to keeping in close contact on these issues with the governments of OPEC states Complimentary close9 Please report host government reactionsKissinger	19750113

outlined in my speech to the American people on                        Monday nightOn January 13 President Ford addressed the nation on his                            programs to address the nations economic problems and the energy                            crisis See ibid pp 3035 I write you in the spirit of                        collaboration that animates our relations to share my thoughts on these new                        measuresOur countries and our key trading partners have recently been struggling with                        unemployment inflation and energy shortages There are as we know no                        easy answers to any of these problems singly or in combination but it is                        clear that we cannot afford to address one aspect of our difficulties while                        ignoring the others Moreover each country must act to achieve a balance                        consistent with its priorities and its particular economic circumstances                        while recognizing it must act in a manner which furthers rather than harms                        the economic wellbeing of other countriesMy policies aim to deal directly with the economic slowdown we now face                        without triggering the major inflationary pressures which might result from                        an overly expansionary policy A tax cut along with measures to stimulate                        investment should reinvigorate the US economy and improve confidence                        Under present conditions we believe it will not restimulate the inflationary                        spiralWe are also taking major steps to reduce our dependence on imported oil We                        are determined to reduce oil imports promptly and significantly and to end                        vulnerability to economic disruption by foreign suppliers by 1985 Immediate                        actions to cut energy imports and to increase both our domestic supplies and                        our ability to use our coal gas oil and nuclear power are clearly                        necessary as are strong measures to

importance I have attached to having had the                        benefit of your views on these issues during our meeting in Martinique We                        are strongly committed to working

taken recently For our                        mutual wellbeing it is imperative that we continue developing a common                        approach in dealing with energy problems and that we continue to coordinate                        closely in confronting our economic difficultiesI look forward to staying in close touch with you on these important                            issuesFord

     THEIR INTERESTS BY OTHER MEANS3 WE QUITE AGREE THAT RECENT ACTIONS OF THE PMG HAVE CONFIDENTIALCONFIDENTIALPAGE 03 ADDIS 00480 141422ZRESULTED IN GREATLY INCREASED DOMESTIC SUPPORT THROUGHOUT

FACTIONS OF                            THE POORLY ARTICULATED INSURGENT LEADERSHIP STRUCTURE THIS IS A TREND                            WHICH WILL BEAR WATCHING4 AS THE DEPARTMENT IS WELL AWARE THE PROBLEM OF FACTIONALISM IS ALSO                            AT THE HEART OF THE DIFFICULTIES FACED BY THE EPMG IN ADDRESSING THE                            ERITREAN PROBLEM IT IS THE REEF UPON WHICH CURRENT EFFORT AT DIALOGUE                            AND PREHAPS ULTIMATELY NEGOTIATION MAY FOUNDER THE SPECIFIC                            DIFFICULTIES WITH WHICH THE EMPG MUST WRESTLE IS REACHING

                         CONCESSIONS IN EITREA IN OTHER PARTS OF ETHIOPIA ARE ROOTED IN REALITIES                            AND CANNOT THEREFORE BE EASILY DISMISSED5 EMERGING FROM THE FOREGOING IS

SOME TIME THIS LEADS US TO THE VIEW                            THAT THE NEAR FUTURE IS MORE LIKELY TO INCLUDE TURMOIL AND CONFUSION IN                            ERITREA AND PERHAPS OTHER ADJACENT PARTS OF THE EMPIRE THAN THE                            EMERGENCE OF A STRUCTURED CONTROLLED INDEPENDENT ERITREAN ENTITY A                            FLUID ISTUATION OF THIS KINK OF COURSE INHERENTLY CONTINUES TO PROVIDE                            OPPORTUNITIES FOR ACCOMMODATION AS WELL AS GROUNDS FOR FURTHER CONFLICT                            THIS IS WHY WE THINK IT PREMATURE TO DISCARD THE POSSIBILITY OF                            ARRANGEMENTS BETWEEN THE EPMG AND INSURGENT ELEMENTS CAPABLE OF LIMITING                            THE SCOPE AND IMPACT OF THE INSURGENCY6 AS FOR THE POSSIBILITY OF RENEWED FIGHTING WE WOULD RATE IT HIGH IT                            REMAINS TO BE SEEN HOWEVER WHETHER IN THE CASE OF A RESURGENCE OF                            MILITARY ACTIVITY THE SITUATION ABOVEDESCRIBED WOULD BE DECISIVELY                            ALTERED WE WOULD POINT OUT IN THIS CONTEXT THAT ALTHOUGH THE                            GOVERNMENTS REGULARS IN THE NORTH ARE VULNERABLE IN THE FIELD AND                            POSSIBLY EVEN IN THEIR GARRISONS THEY REPRESENT A CONSIDERABLE MILITARY                            POTENTIAL IF PROPERLY DISCIPLINED AND LED WE
