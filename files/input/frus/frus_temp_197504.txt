                            2011 The crux of our dilemma is the necessity to preserve the knifeedge                            balance between need to reconcile the need of moving ahead to reduce                            residual EE problems to a minimum                            with the necessity to avoid any action which would set off or                            significantly contribute to a panic situation endangering American lives                            which would not only complicate our EE problem but could have wider repercussions on the                            overall politicalmilitary situation This having been said the                            comments below address the questions raised in reftel:2 A number of employees in all elements of the Mission have already                            applied to have their dependents proceed to safehaven and their orders                            are being issued as rapidly as possible As this process continues we                            expect that others will voluntarily follow suit in the next few days In                            addition we will be moving ahead with travel orders for employees from                                ConGens Danang and Nha Trang with                            a few exceptions of people who will be needed here The latter step is                            entirely logical and can be readily explained DAO is conducting a RIF in                            order to save DAV funds for military supplies A number of American                            business enterprises in the country have already decided to begin                            departure of dependents and at least some of their nonVietnamese staff                            The combined effect of these actions is expected to reduce the US population in Vietnam from the current                            total of about 5800 including all categoriesgovernmental private and                            dependents We will have to determine on a day by day basis what                            additional steps to take Embassy is in touch with PAA with view of increasing scheduled                                PAA flights NonUS diplomatic population in Saigon including                            dependents is less than 1000 and some Missions are now reducing their                            numbers3 We will have no Americans remaining in MR2 within a day or two except of course the nine                            Americans missing in Ban Me Thuot We are in process of thinning out in                                MR3 and MR44 Para 1C of reftel raises issues of monumental proportions which must                            be faced squarely There are more than 17000 locally hired Vietnamese                            employees in various categories direct hire contract garblewith an                            average family size of 8 persons We are talking about 136000 people in                            this category alone These figures include local employees in MR1 and MR2 some of whom reached Saigon Assuming conservatively                            that about 50 percent would opt to leave Vietnam we are talking about                            6070000 people There could well be more In addition there are at                            least 1000 Vietnamese who are close relatives of US citizens Finally there are an estimated 1500 TCNs employed by the US Government and US media                            which have to be taken into account A rough estimate of those close                            relatives of US citizens ranking GVN officials and their families etc                            would exceed ten thousand For planning purposes we should use the                            figure of 100000 for whose safety the USG will have a definite garblemoral                            responsibility5 It is obvious that these numbers in the aggregate pose major practical                            problems of moving such large number of Vietnamese nationals and the                            problem of where these people are to go If we are to emerge with the                            slightest vestige of honor given the history of American involvement in                            Vietnam the only right thing to do must be to move these people to the                                US and resolve any legal problem by                            special legislation later The USG                            certainly has the capability to solve the practical problems6 At this moment we have in the area substantial seaborne transportation                            assets in form of the ships now being used in the refugee evacuation                            including the 4 US naval ships now                            available The carrier Hancock and accompanying                            ships are on the way and we understand are due to arrive about April 8                            In an emergency situation under adverse circumstances we may however                            have considerable difficulty getting people to these ships                            Consequently our emergency planning continues to emphasize air                            evacuation from Tan Son Nhut We could have a serious problem however                            in securing Tan San Nhut Airfield and access to it We are in urgent                            communications with CINCPAC now to                            develop plans to insert on short notice a force to secure the airfield                            We need to develop all plans on an urgent basis and while doing so                            should have available close by all possible military assets to provide                            flexibility which is absolutely essential in a possible situation the                            specific features of which are very difficult to define with any                            precision in advanceMartin	19750403

Minister Long                                Boret also attended the meeting Prior to discussion of                            substance of your telegram with the Acting President he told me that he                            had talked yesterday with Long                                Boret who had agreed in principle to step aside                                Long Boret had asked to                            consult with the Steering Committee of the SocioRepublican Party before                            giving definitive reply2 In addition to talking to Long                                Boret Saukham Khoy                            met last night with other Khmer political luminaries and also with                            Chief of Staff Sak Sutsakhan The                            Acting President pointed out to them that it was a question of hours                            not days and it was necessary to inject a new factor in the equation if                            a blood bath is to be avoided He said students are clamoring for rapid                            change in Khmer leadership Saukham                                Khoy told the assembled SocioRepublican leaders last                            night that the individual personalities must sacrifice themselves to                            obtain a ceasefire and to avoid a blood bath Some of the leaders                            present for example Pan Sothi Minister of Education agreed that                            party politics have been overtaken by events and that rapid action is                            needed Pan Sothi agreed to resign as did the Minister of Finance Khy                            Taing Lim3 After hearing out President Saukham                                Khoy I explained to him and Long Boret gist of your message reftel He clearly understood the                            message and appeared to be much more sympathetic to this scenario than                            did Long Boret I stressed                            throughout the conversation that decisions of this nature must be made                            by the Khmers themselves and that the signal from Sihanouk was tentative at best and we                            had no repeat no assurances that scenario discussed would be acceptable                            to Prince4 Saukham Khoy is taking the                            following actions during the next three to four hours: a calling a                            Cabinet meeting at which Long                                Boret and his group will resign b appointing Chan Sau                            as the new Prime Minister c unless Saukham                                Khoy changes his mind or is prevented by others from                            acting he intends to make public statement to international press and radio in Khmer and                            French later in the afternoon inviting Prince Sihanouk to return to Phnom Penh to arrange an end to                            the war in a humanitarian manner He will also call for a ceasefire to                            become effective as of a certain hour and date He would also assure the                            safety of the Prince and his party in the name of the Phnom Penh                            authorities He would point out willingness of all Khmer personalities                            to step aside in the higher interest of the Cambodian nation Finally                            he would make his appeal in the name of the suffering Khmer people to                            put an end to their suffering Before making this declaration he plans                            to check it out with the Khmer civilian leadership as well as selected                            military leadership This latter suggestion was adopted by Saukham Khoy as a result of Long Borets suggestion so that the                            military would not fall apart following this declaration inviting                                Sihanouk to return5 Saukham Khoy told me he will                            send his son to my office or to my residence to keep me informed of                            these developments which I expect to occur in the next five hours6 Before leaving Acting President and Long                                Boret I said that in the event this last minute effort                            should fail and the current Khmer leadership has to depart the country                            I had plans to take a limited number with us if and when we have to                            depart Phnom Penh I stressed with them again that I did not wish to                            play God and determine who under these circumstances should have access                            to our aircraft in order to gain safety abroad I told them they should                            continue to send to my residence each morning at 6:30 am one of their                            trusted aides who would hand carry a note from me back to them If we                            had to leave the Khmers would have no more than 2 hours to come to this                            Embassy to be processed for boarding our aircraft They Saukham Khoy and Long Boret would have to make the                            decisions as to who should go with us in the event the worst happens                            Both men understood my explanation fully7 Finally Saukham Khoy stated                            that he is convinced the people of Phnom Penh have confidence in him                            personally and will accept whatever steps he takes to try to end the                            conflict including specifically the appeal to Sihanouk to return here8 Comment: Should Saukham Khoy make a public declaration today inviting                                Sihanouk to return to Phnom                            Penh the Prince is likely to get the word first from the AFP representative in Peking as has been                            the case in the past with other declarations emanating from the GKR for example Marshal Lon Nols offer of unconditional                            negotiations of last July 9 We would hope that the Prince would not

          fulfill his obligations for the safety of Americans as well for the                            protection of Vietnamese who have been associated with us As explained                            in para 3 in Saigons 5111Dated April 16 Ford Library National Security Adviser                                Presidential Country Files for East Asia and the Pacific Box 21                                Vietnam State Department Telegrams To SECSTATE Nodis                                4 we do not believe it feasible to try to assume                            responsibility to lift all the Vietnamese to whom the President refers                            directly from Saigon We will instruct our own local employees to make                            their way to designated spots on the coast where they may be evacuated                            Many may not make it but we do owe those who do the chance to escape                            We have been told by our American press that their principals have been                            informed in Washington that after the fall of South VietNam we will                            negotiate for the release and safe exit of Vietnamese nationals who have                            worked for the Americans This caused several hours of excruciating                            damage control operations this morning to keep this story from                            breaking If it had the local repercussions would have been worse than                            Danang Since you had already assured media their local employees in                            Saigon would be evacuated we have arranged for the very quiet                            exfiltration of some of the media local employees and can get them all                            out Another mistake like this in Washington could be enormously costly                            to us here Perhaps such questions should be referred to us here5 Regardless of the time Congress may take on whatever consultation is                            necessary for the admission of our own Vietnamese employees we will                            continue to advise them to try to get to designated points on the coast                            where they will be picked up Therefore it is suggested that it would                            be useful for Washington to cease being overwhelmed by the magnitude of                            the problem and leave the planning to CINCPAC Judging from the performance of Admiral Benton                            there can be no question about the capacity of CINCPAC to do this And there is no                            question of the Executive branchs ability to arrange their quick                            absorption into the US and                            other countries John Thomas present Director of ICEM in Geneva could as he did as                            Director of Cuban Refugee Program work out domestic arrangements in                            US in very short time If we fail to do this the racist overtones                            of such a decision would enormously decrease what influence we might                            ever expect to have in Asia again7 With regard to your paragraph 4In                                paragraph 4 telegram 88999 to Saigon April 18 Kissinger wrote: I would                                appreciate more details of what you have in mind for evacuation of                                Vietnamese Is it realistic to believe that Vung Tau can be used for                                mass evacuation Do you believe that certain South Vietnamese forces                                could be counted on to help secure evacuation zones for mass                                evacuations I am assured the answer to both questions is                            affirmative What is not so certain is how many of our local employees                            can get there I again suggest we cease being paralyzed by the                            orderofmagnitude of the problem leaving it in the most capable hands                            of CINCPAC to handle the evacuation                            of such of those Vietnamese to whom we are committed that are able to                            get there I cannot recommend that we try to introduce enough American                            forces to permit their evacuation from Saigon8 There is nothing Thieu can do                            which would not be immediately known and thereby run the horrible risk                            of setting off the hysteria we must avoid at all costs for as long as                            possible The questions you raiseidentification assembly                            transportare ones on which Washington consideration will be fruitless                            The only questions we can really handlein Washington or in Saigonis                            that of identification and that we can handle here When we get to that                            point all but a very few Americans will have left Who must be gotten                            out first Transport must be the problem of our locals to the coast We                            will have secure area of embarkation and there we are confident CINCPAC can cope General Smith has personally visited Vung Tau                            today at my request9 We have noted the statement that we must face the true situation and                            begin to decide upon the choices available to us We have done that                            here but we are not so sure about Washington Part of facing the true                            situation is that there is nothing Thieu can do to help us in this particular problem He                            cannot possibly broaden the categories of Vietnamese citizens excepted                            from the Vietnamese travel ban without triggering the panic we should be                            all striving to avoid Even any attempt on his part to help us would                            prejudice the decisions of the Vietnamese who will actually effect this                            operation I am not sure that any Vietnamese could be convinced just now                            that we do not wish to proceed in a spirit of panic as he reads the                            headlines out of Washington10 The one simple action that might be useful is to avoid a repetition                            of this mornings action when instructions were attempted to be given by                            a Washington agency to the head of a Mission element from his agency In                            this case we were already doing under my authority part of what was suggested And the                            other point was not practical at the moment Fortunately we are a close                            knit family here and these endruns will not work But constant attempts                            could cause chaos if they continue11 I know very well that witnesses before congressional committees                            cannot be protected from a member who wishes instant TV coverage but I                            cannot emphasize too emphatically that constant comment on evacuation in                            Washington is most unhelpful here as is the understandable temptation                            to delve into detail which can best be handled here I hope you can                            influence your colleagues to keep both these points very much in mind                            over the next ten days when coolness will be absolutely essential12 I am well aware of both domestic and congressional concerns and I                            will keep them very much in mind but my overriding concern is the                            safety of the Americans for whom I have the responsibility to the                            President13 I have set a target of 1700 Americans remaining here by COB Tuesday

            would hope to reduce that considerably further in the following                            daysMartin	19750418

Affairs Ibrahaim                        alWali provided succinct statement of current Iraqi foreign policy This                        review although enunciated in generalities is of special significance                        because it comes just six days after RCC                        Vice Chairman Saddam Hussein met                        with all Iraqi Ambassadors in Arab and developing countries and expounded                        the full dimensions of Iraqs policy in Arab and international fields                        AlWali attended this meeting2 AlWali said Iraqs chief goals were to end its isolation and have                        regional peace and stability in order to achieve its own development Such a                        policy demanded realism and pragmatism Iraq therefore devoted major                        effort and resources during past year toward rapprochement with Iran and                        resolution of Kurdish rebellion This war in addition to causing                        instability and uncertainty had cost Iraq 3 million dinars US dollars 10                        million a day Iraq had had to give Iran the territory it wanted on the                        ShattalArab This was a major concession but it had been necessary and                        Iraq had every intention of living up to the Accord to the letter                        Implementation is proceeding smoothly3 In the Arab sphere Iraq is likewise following a policy based on realism                        and pragmatism It recognizes that there are major differences among the                        Arab states from monarchies to military regimes but Iraq does not consider                        nature of regimes its business Each state is free to choose its own regime                        Relations are developing very well with Saudi Arabi Jordan Tunisia and                        others Iraqs ultimate aim is Arab unity for in unity is strength and                        stability but this is not for tomorrow4 Relations with the socialist countries are normal Iraq maintains                        Embassies in all the European countries except Albania and expects to                        continue to have good relations with them5 Relations with Western Europe are now very good with the resumption of                        relations with Great Britain and the FRG                        Economic relations in particular are flourishing6 The only Western country with which Iraq does not have normal relations is                        the US This does not interfere with the economic relationship that is                        developing in our mutual interest When certain impediments are removed there will be progress                        on the diplomatic front as well However speaking frankly alWali said                        that the unrestrained US support for Israel remains the major obstacle He                        belittled recent settlement efforts and compared Israel to a thief who had                        robbed the Arabs four times and now says it will return the proceeds of the                        fourth robbery while keeping the rest This was unacceptable There can be                        no settlement with Israel until there is a psychological change inside                        Israel that convinces the Israelis that they are a state within the Arab                        world and must accommodate themselves to this overriding reality When and                        if this occurred about which the Iraqis are most skeptical an                        accommodation could come about He ridiculed talk of throwing the Israelis                        into the sea as childish nonsense He remarked jokingly that the only other                        problem with the US was payment for the former Embassy compound now the                            MFA He also made a point of saying he                        gave USINT special treatment by receiving                        me at any time because of the sensitive nature of USIraqi relations                        Normally he receives only Ambassadors7 Another circle in which Iraq operates and hopes to play a prominent role                        alWali said is the nonaligned world Iraq believes the developing                        countries have much in common and must help each other Iraq is providing                        substantial assistance in loans and grants to these countries It had                        proposed Baghdad as the site of 1979 NonAligned Summit Conference but at                        the recent meeting in Havana had found that support for Cuba was such that                        Iraq had had to withdraw its request8 Comment: Read in conjunction with Saddam Husseins recent interview with Rose alYusufA                            Stateowned Egyptian daily newspaper two aspects of alWalis                        remarks are particularly striking Saddam is quoted as saying that Iraqs                        role at this time was to provide a model of socialism democracy and                        unified action the clear implication of which is that Iraq now expects to                        promote its interests through example and persuasion rather than coercion                        and subversion On ArabIsraeli conflict Saddam said Geneva Conference                        should be last stage of peaceful solution where Arabs should go only after                        we have reached peak of armament and that only when Israel begins to                        believe its existence is dependent on being accepted by the Arabs will it                        Israel

frus1969-76v37d51	51 Telegram From the Department of State to the Embassy in Saudi Arabia	None	1975-04-01 00:35:00	None	None	72746 Subject: Tactics for Forthcoming Prepcon and ConsumerProducer Conference1 At earliest opportunity and prior to departure Saudi delegation for Prepcon you should meet with Oil Minister                            Yamani to convey our views and                        to discuss what we see as contributing to a successful conferenceOn April 2 Akins reported that he had met with                                Yamani before receiving the                            instructions contained in this telegram but that many of the points                            were however discussed with the Minister Yamani informed him that Prince Saud                            would not attend Prepcon and had                            not yet decided who would go to the meeting Yamani stated that Saudi Arabia                            would like to cooperate with the United States but was not sure how                            close or overt this cooperation should be Regardless he assured Akins                            that Saudi Arabia would oppose any dramatic moves on the part of the                                OPEC radicals and that above                            all Saudi Arabia wishes to avoid confrontation between the producers                            and the consumers Because Akins had met with Yamani before the latter left for                            Beirut and Europe he prepared a paper summarizing this telegram and                            left it with Yamanis office                            which assured the Ambassador that Yamani would receive it before his departure Telegram                            2391 from Jidda April 2 ibid D75011505592 First express our pleasure that Yamani will continue as Minister of Petroleum under King                            Khalid and ask if Prince Saud                        is still scheduled to represent SAG at the                            Prepcon Because of the very                        special relationship between our two countries our position as the worlds                        largest oil importer and Saudi Arabias position as a producer with                        considerable discretional ability to swing its production up or down we                        believe we will jointly benefit through close consultation and cooperation                        We are well aware that Saudi Arabia will play a very significant role and we                        want to maintain close contact with the Saudi delegation in Paris3 You should mention to Yamani that                        we are also well aware of Saudi interest in making a producerconsumer                        conference a success We assume the Saudis like ourselves do not want to                        see the conference degenerate into polemics or end up in a producerconsumer                        confrontation We feel this is even more important now with the new                        leadership in the Kingdom following Faisals assassination As Yamani knows we have been reluctant to                        go along with any producerconsumer conference until both sides were very                        well prepared because we thought it would fail otherwise If the Prepcon and a future conference are to                        succeed much will depend on whether we can agree on an agenda both sides                        can live with4 As Yamani knows from his last                        meetings with the Secretary in RiyadhSee Document 41 we intend the American                        approach to be cooperative The Secretary in his latest press conference on                        March 26 said: We believe that the consumerproducer conference is being                        conducted in the interests of both sides for the common benefit for the                        interest of a developing and thriving world economy which is in the                        interest of producers as well as consumers and should not be tied to the                        situation in the Middle East Therefore we are proceeding with our                        preparations for the consumerproducer conference and progress is being                        made in that direction and we find it essentially on scheduleThe text of Kissingers press conference is in Department of State                                Bulletin April 14 1975 pp                        4614705 You should tell Yamani that we                        think we are close on basic approaches to the conference: We agree that A                        we should keep the representation limited to a relatively few key countries                        B we both have obligations toward the MSAs including promotion of the                        production of fertilizers C stable economic conditions in the Western                        world are needed to allow Saudi Arabia to pursue its goal of rapid economic                        development in the next decades and for the West to fend off                        Communismradicalism D measures for conservation and the search for                        alternative sources of petroleum must be accelerated E we must work                        within and not outside of existing international monetary mechanisms and F whatever the causes of the                        present energy problem it can be turned into an opportunity for                        producerconsumer collaboration We do not want to use a conference to                        assess blame on any particular parties because this would be unproductive                        and could lead to a confrontation Rather we want to look to the future on                        how through close bilateral cooperation we can bring about general                        cooperation between producers and consumers6 As we see it Prepcon is beginning of                        a process which will give us a better basis for relating to each other on                        issues of mutual concern To avoid misunderstandings we would like to set                        forth to Yamani our hopes for the                            Prepcon which we hope Saudis could                        support: A an agenda which covers recycling industrialization of producer                        economies aid to LDCs inward investment and pricing and security of                        supply B recognition of need for dialogue on other raw materials but                        maintaining focus of this conference on energy and leaving other commodities                        for discussion in more appropriate forums such as forthcoming UNGA Special Session C holding                        participation in producerconsumer conference to manageable proportions so                        that it does not deteriorate into a circus D a neutral site for future                        conference and E agreeing in principle that conference should be held as                        soon as practicable but leaving actual date open to ensure that we are all                        adequately preparedKissinger	19750401

Secretary1 Reading drafts of agenda exchanged over weekendSee footnotes 3 5 and 7 Document 53                        indicates that industrialized countries have shown very great and perhaps                        excessive flexibility on question of agenda Central focus of conference on                        energy question is essential from our viewpoint It is unclear how USECJapan

           presentation purpose here that conference will be centered on world energy                        problems and actions which producers and consumers can take separately and                        together to help alleviate these problems for all countries and MSAs in particular You should therefore                        reiterate our requirement of clear linkage between other agenda issues and                        energy You should also note that other issues such as participation date                        site and chairmanship have not yet been resolved On question of                        participation you should maintain position that invitation to IEA is absolute prerequisite our attendance                        conference You should not agree on final text of agenda and other                        conference issues without my prior approval2 In view likely outcome of PrepconAfter meeting from 1 to 7                            am on April 15 in a last ditch effort to resolve the agenda                            question the two sides agreed that they could make no further progress                            on the issues that separated them including the scope of the full                            conference indexation maintenance of real value and others Because                            of the lack of any prospect of reconciling respective negotiating                            mandates the delegations decided that it would not be productive to                            continue the exercise of the past nine days At 1 pm that day                            Chairman de Guiringaud tried to                            give the group of industrialized nations another agenda proposal on                            behalf of the seven OPECLDC countries Robinson and the other delegation heads however noted                            that the paper was not a formal proposal and refused to accept it on an                            informal basis Furthermore the US representatives no longer wanted                            to permit the French Chairman to exercise the role of an intermediary                            and remarked that it seemed that only he among everyone present refused                            to recognize that the meeting was dead Telegram 9533 from Paris                            April 15 National Archives RG 59                            Central Foreign Policy Files D7501310570 I question whether                        you should not immediately reschedule visit to Tehran I place a higher value on our bilateral relations                        with Iran than on rhetorical sparring with OPECLDC group From Ansarys reaction Iranians apparently                        regard your visit there as urgent You could set deadline your departure                        Paris TuesdayApril 15 The conference ended on                            April 16 either leaving Enders in charge of delegation or have all of US                        delegation depart You should decide this on basis which course best                        contributes to result we seek3 I wish it clearly understood by our entire delegation that outcome of                        preparatory meeting is of greater concern to me than whether we have                        unanimity with other countries In final analysis they need US participation at conference We remain ready                        to attend properly prepared energy conference between consumers and                        producers as originally called by French We are not prepared to attend raw                        materials conference where energy issue has seen all but submerged We will                        maintain this posture even at risk taking responsibility for failure of                        preparatory meetingIn his closing remarks at                            the end of the conference Enders said: We were of course invited here by the                            President of the French Republic to prepare for a conference on energy                            and energyrelated issues We came here ready to discuss these issues                            which are of central concern to all countries Others have insisted on a                            much broader conference extending to all aspects of the relationship                            between the industrialized countries and the developing world We have                            been and will continue to be willing to discuss seriously raw materials                            and other development issues in forums more directly concerned with them                            and to attempt therein to seek mutually beneficial solutions However                            we believe that the proposed conference could achieve constructive                            results only if it were focused on a relatively limited number of points                            related to the central subject of energy For the full text of his                            remarks see Department of State Bulletin May

THAT WHILE MY RECEPTION HAS BEEN WARM AND CORRECT                            THE INDIANS ARE NOT TAKING PARTICULARLY GOOD CARE OF THEIR RELATIONS                            WITH THE US THESE DAYS2 NEEDLESS TO SAY I COULD HAVE ARRIVED IN INDIA AT A BETTER TIME I                            AGREE THAT IT WAS BEST THAT I WAIT OUT THE EARLY FIREWORKS IN BANGKOK                            NEVERTHELESS WITH THE PRESS CORPS LOOKING ON THE GOVERNMENT OF INDIA                            VERY CAREFULLY ARRANGED MY PRESENTATION OF CREDENTIALS AND FIRST CALLS                            SO THAT THERE WAS NO CAUSE FOR SPECULATION THAT I WAS KEPT WAITING I                            DELIBERATELY DECIDED TO AVOID DOING MUCH BUSINESS DURING MY TALKS WITH                            THE FOREIGN SECRETARY THE DEPUTY FOREIGN MINISTER THE FOREIGN MINISTER                            AND THE PRIME MINISTER ONE OR TWO THINGS WERE OF SIGNIFICANCE HOWEVER                            WHEN I TALKED TO THE FOREIGN SECRETARY ON MARCH 5 I MENTIONED THE                            CONTROVERSY OVER INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES IN THE US AND SAID THAT THESE                            WERE BEING BROUGHT UNDER CONTROL WITH INDIA IN MIND HE SAID THAT IT                            COULD HAPPEN THAT SOMETHING COULD BE DONE WHICH WAS NOT AUTHORIZED I                            TOLD HIM THAT I INTENDED TO WATCH OVER ALL US ACTIVITIES IN INDIA AND                            CATEGORICALLY ASSURED HIM THAT THERE WOULD BE NO US INTERFERENCE IN INDIAN AFFAIRS I                            CERTAINLY DONT EXPECT THE ALLEGATIONS AGAINST US TO STOP BUT I DO                            INTEND CAREFULLY TO SUPERVISE OUR ACTIVITIES HERE AND HAVE ALREADY TAKEN                            STEPS TO AVOID AROUSING SUSPICIONS BY UNNECESSARY TRAVEL3 ONE ASPECT OF MY CONVERSATION WITH THE FOREIGN MINISTER ON APRIL 1                            ILLUSTRATES WHAT I MEAN BY THE INDIANS NOT TAKING MUCH CARE OF THEIR                            RELATIONS WITH US MAKING CONVERSATION I SAID THAT I WAS PLEASED THAT                            THE PL 480 AGREEMENT HAD BEEN COMPLETED CHAVAN WAS NOT EVEN AWARE OF THIS AND HAD TO ASK HIS MAN                            TEJA WHAT HAD HAPPENED THE INDIANS IN WASHINGTON TOLD US THAT THEY                            WOULD ISSUE A PRESS RELEASE IN NEW DELHI THEY DIDNT AND THE SIGNING                            DIDNT GET MUCH ATTENTION IN THE PAPERS HERE AS USUAL THE DIFFICULTIES                            IN THE NEGOTIATIONS GOT MUCH MORE4 AS I HAVE ALREADY REPORTED THE PRIME MINISTER SEEMED UNUSUALLY                            FRIENDLY THE MOST IN MY VARIOUS CONVERSATIONS WITH HER THERE WERE                            STILL THE LONG SILENCES IT IS A CURIOUS GOVERNMENT IN WHICH NEITHER THE                            PRIME MINISTER NOR THE FOREIGN MINISTER SAY MUCH TO REPRESENTATIVES FOR                            FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS5 IT SHOULD BE OBVIOUS FROM WHAT I HAVE SAID SO FAR THAT MY OFFICIAL                            CONVERSATIONS HAVE DONE LITTLE TO GIVE ME A FEEL FOR THE SITUATION OUT                            HERE BUT I HAVE IN THE COURSE OF THE ORDINARY THINGS A NEW AMBASSADOR                            DOES INCLUDING MY FIRST OFFICIAL VISITS TO BOMBAY AND MADRAS DONE A                            LOT OF LISTENING TO INDIANS AND DIPLOMATIC COLLEAGUES ALSO INDIAS                            REMARKABLY FREE PRESS IS REVEALING MY IMPRESSION IS THAT WHILE THE                            GOVERNMENT HERE WANTS TO PRESERVE A BASIS FOR A RELATIONSHIP WITH THE US                            WHICH WILL MAKE IT POSSIBLE FOR IT TO GET THE THINGS FROM US IT WANTS                            IT ISNT WORKING VERY HARD AT IT IT IS TRUE THAT THE INDIANS MAY HAVE                            MADE SOME EFFORT TO CONTAIN THEIR REACTION TO OUR ARMS SALES POLICY BUT                            I DISAGREE WITH WASHINGTON THAT THEIR REACTION HAS BEEN MODERATE I                            BELIEVE THAT WASHINGTON MAY ALSO UNDERESTIMATE THE INTENSITY AND                            SERIOUSNESS OF THEIR CONCERN OVER THE POLICY ANOTHER THING WHICH I HAVE NOTICED IS THE                            EXTENT TO WHICH THE INDIANS CONTINUE TO JOIN UP WITH THE RADICAL                            NONALIGNED AND IN THE PROCESS TAKE ISSUE WITH US WHETHER AT HAVANA OR                            LIMA THEY PREACH AN INTERNATIONAL SHARE THE WEALTH DOCTRINE WHICH WOULD                            DESTROY US ALL I HOPE TO GOD THE EGYPTIANS DO NOT GET THEM INVOLVED IN                            THE GENEVA TALKS ON PALESTINE6 GIVEN ALL OF THIS I THOUGHT IT IMPORTANT THAT I START OUT HERE ON THE                            RIGHT FOOT I COULD NOT POSSIBLY ACCEPT THIS DISREGARD FOR US INTERESTS                            CONSEQUENTLY WHEN I HAVE HAD OFFICIAL TALKS I HAVE STUCK CAREFULLY TO                            PROTOCOL AND AVOIDED BUSINESS: OTHERWISE I WOULD HAVE HAD TO HAVE BEEN                            UNPLEASANT I HAVE DELIBERATELY SPOKEN QUITE FRANKLY TO THE PRESS IN                            ORDER TO GET GREATER REALISM INTO OUR RELATIONS I HAVE MADE IT CLEAR I                            WAS NOT HERE TO IMPROVE THE CLIMATE OF RELATIONS: I WAS HERE REPRESENT                            MY GOVERNMENT I HAVE SAID THAT GOOD RELATIONS WERE A TWOWAY STREET AND                            MADE IT CLEAR THAT THE INITIATIVE WAS THAT OF THE GOVERNMENT HERE I                            ALSO POINTED OUT THAT INDIA PAYS IN THE US FOR ITS RADICAL ACTIONS WITH                            THE NONALIGNED RECOGNITION OF THE PLO IN SAYING SUCH THINGS I HAVE                            TAKEN SOME HEAT IN THE PRESS AND FROM LEFTIST POLITICIANS I EXPECTED                            THIS AND TAKE IT AS EVIDENCE THAT I HAVE BEEN HEARD7 ANOTHER IMPRESSION WHICH MAY BE WORTH REPORTING IS THE EXTENT TO WHICH

REPORTED IN DETAIL AND FREQUENTLY WITH SATISFACTION THE CHORUS ON                            THE CIA HAS BUILT UP AGAIN AND WE ARE                            ACCUSED OF EVERYTHING FROM PLOTTING THE MURDER OF INDIAN OFFICIALS TO                            SUPPORTING JAYAPRAKASH NARAYAN IN HIS AGITATION AGAINST MRS GANDHI IN FAIRNESS MOST OF THIS COMES                            FROM THE IRRESPONSIBLE PAPERS AND LEFTIST POLITICIANS BUT ON OCCASION A                            STATE POLITICAL LEADER OR A CONGRESS PARTY OFFICIAL CHIMES IN THIS WILL                            PROBABLY INCREASE UNTIL MRS GANDHI HOLDS ELECTIONS IN THE NEXT 812 MONTHS8 ALL OF THIS CONVINCES ME THAT LIFE IS GOING TO BE SLOW IN NEW DELHI FOR A WHILE I                            DONT INTEND ANY INITIATIVES TO SPEED IT UP: THAT IS FOR THE INDIANS I                            AM QUITE PREPARED TO TAKE IT EASY FOR A WHILESAXBE	19750404

She several times                            expressed warm appreciation for American assistance I was most                            impressed with her interest and grasp of variety of topics In

              well to continue to demonstrate strong interest in her style of moderate                            leadership and to maintain significant aid level to Sri Lanka END

             single year Prime Minister was repeatedly appreciative of US aid                            during conversation She said Sri Lanka was not beggar nation and wanted                            to make its own way Substantial assistance however was essential                            through present very difficult economic period She made no specific                            request for additional assistance4 After recalling her warm relations with President Nixon she said she had read great deal                            about President Ford and would                            very much like to meet him I                            said I hoped that could be arranged but extended no explicit                            invitation5 In terms of Sri Lankas continually declining terms of trade she                            summarized powerful adverse impact of last two years world economic                            conditions She expressed hope that ways could be found to stabilize                            prices for Sri Lankas primary export products especially tea6 Referring to our current projection and to consensus I had observed                            in discussion with OECD Economic Ministers I reviewed improving world                            and American economic outlook but mentioned danger of renewed inflation                            Concerning Sri Lankas outlook I expressed pleasure over encouraging                            reports of Sri Lankas offshore oil potential and mentioned an American                            firms interest in recent worldwide call for drilling service contract                            bids7 On issue of finding longer term solutions to balance of payments                            financing problems of Most Seriously Affected MSA developing                            countries I urged that Sri Lanka consider carefully and sympathetically                            proposed trust fund in association with the IMF She was keenly                            interested8 We discussed Sri Lankas leading economic problem: food I mentioned                            fiscal burden price distortions and production disincentives that                            arise from heavily subsidized consumption She acknowledged this was                            serious difficulty for Sri Lanka but pointed out political risks of                            tough economic decisions I                            said we faced same dilemma9 On international political issues Prime Minister said Sri Lanka will                            continue carefully balanced approach to large nations specifically                            mentioning Soviet Union PRC India and Pakistan She did not raise                            Indian Ocean Peace Zone or Diego Garcia I congratulated her on Sri                            Lankas hosting of 1976 NonAligned Conference She said she was looking                            forward to it and GSL was actively                            preparing for that event She believes Summit will stimulate significant                            economic benefits to Sri Lanka10 She touched briefly on VietNam expressing sadness over human                            tragedy and need for much increased humanitarian aid11 In detailed discussion about national political scene Prime Minister                            said 1971 insurrection was extremely serious threat to her Government                            and to general political stability She expressed deep appreciation for                            rapid substantial American assistance in that crisis I said that we                            greatly admired her courage and leadership at that time She also talked                            at some length about political philosophy of her late husband as Prime                            Minister and increasingly prominent political role of her children She                            clearly sees her family as important element in nations political                            future12 Referring again to high US aid level this year 355 million I said that although                            Congress examined assistance proposals more closely each year United                            States was committed to assisting nations which help themselves I said                            however that Sri LankaUS ties should not be based on aid alone Our                            mutual goal should be development of longterm comprehensive                            relationship through which we can discuss any issue of mutual interest                            candidly and constructively13 COMMENT: This was personally very satisfying meeting Prime Minister                            was most gracious most appreciative of American interest and real                            support for Sri Lanka and most interested in current American view of                            difficult global scene In my judgment Prime Minister and Sri Lanka                            over next 18 months will have increasingly important role among                            nonaligned nations 1976 NonAligned Summit could assume major                            significance in world political developments and Prime Minister will                            have key opportunity to promote moderate constructive deliberation  or                            to acquiesce in meaningless antiWestern polemics I think recent US                            aid and this visit form good basis to encourage Prime Ministers stated                            intention to pursue first alternative We will do well to continue our                            aid at significant level and to demonstrate our ongoing interest in                            Prime Minister Bandaranaikes                            pragmatic personal leadership

  OF VARIOUS BODIES LIKE WORLD BANK IMF AND GATT AND THEREFORE ANY                            DECISIONS OF UNGA WOULD BE MORE IN SENSE OF IDENTIFYING AND ENCOURAGING

COOPERATIVE MANNER WE HOPE                            THAT LDCS WILL COME TO ACCEPT THAT CONFRONTATION AND COOPERATION CANNOT                            CONTINUE TO COEXIST THAT PURSUIT OF
