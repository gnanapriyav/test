and US                            Policy1 Summary Lon                                Nol has not developed into a strong leader over the past                            four years of war His 1971 stroke sapped his energy and he failed to                            pick strong advisors relying on relatives or cronies instead Not                            particularly intelligent or wellorganized the Marshal has seen                            military reversals economic disaster and political chicanery and                            violence undermine his popularity Though no longer loved he still has                            some measure of respect and can instill fear His authority over the                            army so far unchallenged may not survive a serious future crisis A                            skillful politician able to use the prestige of his office President Lon Nol so far has been able                            to maintain the stability which underlies the Republics successful                            response to the 197374 KC dry season                            offensive The Marshal has been responsive to our suggestions for                            changes in economic military or diplomatic strategy but has kept his                            freedom of action and has occasionally shortcircuited implementation of                            those suggestions he has found unpalatable Totally unacceptable to the                            other Khmer side Lon Nol does not                            have the force to compel them to accept him as the Republics                            interlocutor American policy never wedded itself directly to Lon Nol and we should therefore be                            prepared to accept the principle of his departure from power as part of                            an overall settlement of the Cambodian conflict His departure should                            however be used to obtain a quid pro quo from the other side End summaryLeader of a Modern State2 No one would pick Lon Nol to                            lead a modern state His rise was an accident of Khmer history due more                            than anything else to Norodom                                Sihanouks desire to keep a modest manageable figure as                            leader of the Khmer right Where others notably Nguyen Van Thieu have grown to match                            the job of Chief of State Lon Nol                            has not He was admittedly severely hampered by his 1971 stroke which                            lessened his energy and made impossible the kind of fastmoving                            countryside visits that Thieu has                            used to build his popular base Lon                                Nol has moreover become more dependent on a coterie of                            yesman advisors and illequipped cronies devoted more to their                            personal aggrandizement than to the national interest This group is                            unwilling to explain to him the                            realities of Cambodias situation leaving the Marshal dependent on                            foreigners usually this Embassy for candid assessments Lon Nol lavishly rewards loyal                            subordinates and permits them to carry on well past the point where                            their incompetence becomes manifest3 Lon Nol is not intelligent and                            his prose and conversation betray a disorderly mind He does not think                            logically and must be led by the hand through a chain of reasoning The                            Marshal tends to involve himself in details of matters he does not have                            the time to study and fully understand consequently he issues orders                            on tactical aspects of both the military and civil affairs that often do                            not square with the realities thereby causing problems rather than                            solving them4 Unfortunately for Cambodia Lon                                Nol like Sihanouk                            is deeply suspicious of wouldbe rivals He used a succession of Prime                            Ministers including the prestigious Khmer Krom leader Son Ngoc Thanh                            as scapegoats to expiate continuing economic military and diplomatic                            decline from 1970 to 1974 The Marshal eased out first the popular but                            ineffective In Tam in late 1971                            and again in 1973 and then Cheng Heng and the administratively                            talented Sirik Matak in early                            1972 but found he could not make the ousters stick in the face of an                            accelerating decline in popular confidence see below and worsening                            governmental and military efficiency5 With the departure of Lon Non                            the Marshals activist intriguing younger brother in 1973 Sirik Matak In Tam and Cheng Heng returned to collaboration The                            latter two fell again leaving Sirik                                Matak now apparently satisfied with his role as high                            assistant to the President and the Marshal evidently convinced that                                Sirik Matak is no threat If                                Lon Nols past history is any                            guide he would see the capable Prime                                Minister Long Boret as posing the most likely immediate                            challenge to his supremacy Long                                Boret however is without a military base is faced with                            overwhelming problems and so clearly enjoys American support that                                Lon Nol is still willing to                            work with and support him6 These weaknesses are not balanced by the Marshals strengths He is a                            hard worker and a patriot Capable of vindictiveness he is also                            compassionate As a politician Lon                                Nol surpasses all other GKR political figures He knows how to size up his                            political opponents and allies and can pick the right combination of                            carrot and stick to move them To control the military Lon Nol uses the prestige of his office                            and his title of Supreme Commander He still retains considerable                            authority over the military and even the most outspoken Young Turk does not dare to face the                            Marshal down7 The Marshal uses this ability to handle politicians and the military                            to ensure reasonable stability under which technicians in the Cabinet                            and armed forces have the opportunity to bring order out of the                            administrative chaos in both civil and military affairs The successful                            dry season defense and Prime Minister Long                                Borets successful balancing act in the economic and social fields are                            evidence of the Marshals effectivenessLeader of His People8 Lon Nol crosses into both the                            civilian and military segment of the elite He was a judge and province                            governor before becoming a Lt Colonel and military commander in 1952                            and then rising to Lt General and CommanderinChief of Royal Forces                            Among the military Lon Nol draws                            support because he backs up his subordinates rewards loyalty and                            subtly mingles decisiveness with an ability to cushion individuals from                            the consequences of his decisions Sirik                                Matak by contrast is more decisive but cares less                            about saving others face The Marshal was before his stroke a                            physically powerful man he enjoyed considerable prestige for successful                            operations against the Viet Minh while he was in                            Battambang Many civilians respected Lon                                Nol for his judiciousness and his compassion9 Although he lacks the oratorical skills and charisma of a Sihanouk Lon                                Nol was genuinely popular Among the people he was known                            by the affectionate title Ta Khmau the Dark Grandfather because his                            bronze complexion is much closer to the color of the Khmer peasant than                            to that of the other paler members of the SinoKhmer elite His                            widelyknown devotion to astrologers and geomancers strikes a responsive                            chord in a country where passages de vie are celebrated on                            magicallydetermined dates and the average soldier fights with a                            buddhaimage between his teeth believing firmly in its protection                                Lon Nol also received a                            measure of the reverence accorded to Khmer rulers from the days of the                            godkings10 Continued popularity however demanded a performance the Marshal                            could not sustain By late 1971 a host of political and economic                            problems highlighted by the Chenla II military debacle began to emerge                                Lon Nol escaped from blame as                            popular criticism settled on his entourage especially his younger                            brother Lon Non The stroke had                            affected his popular image and he came to be viewed as a pitiable figure                            whose heart was still in the right place In early 1972 however more                            daring student elements began to question his leadership Violence                            directed against students manifest irregularities in the June 1972                            Presidential election and a growing economic crisis sparked by                            interdiction of lines of communication drove elite confidence in                                Lon Nol to a nadir and popular                            unrest to a high Younger military officers began desultory coup talk                            and major civilian figures voiced their despair11 Although most of the elite has given up on Lon Nol popular confidence in him recovered marginally                            in 1973 with the formation of the High Political Council and stood up                            under the dry season attack and successful defense of the capital in                            early 1974 At this point inflation and the destruction of Khmer rural                            life along with the continued toll of approximately 200 killed weekly have engendered public apathy                            towards all Khmer military and civilian leaders The people continue to                            endure while civilian elements of the elite reluctantly confess that                            they can name no one to replace the Marshal and recreate the spirit that                            brought the Khmer into the war12 Younger military commanders with an exaggerated idea of their own                            worth talk about replacing the Marshal but Lon Nol still maintains a certain authority and                            political skill that prevents such talk from being translated into                            action These younger officers will not present a serious challenge to                            the Marshals leadership unless the Republics fortunes military or                            diplomatic suffer a serious reversal which they mayLon Nol and US Policy13 The United States has not publicly avowed support for any individual                            leader or group in the Khmer Republic Lon                                Nol as Chief of State is useful as long as he can                            assure political stability under which the technicians can operate to                            improve military and civil effectiveness The President has so far                            accepted our recommendations on critical economic reforms national                            conscription military management and diplomatic initiatives                            Implementation is spotty however and Lon                                Nol has shortcircuited action on unpalatable reforms                            which he has accepted in principle14 Our assessment is that no available political figure or combination                            of figures is likely to provide the leadership needed to reverse popular                            apathy and reinstill the Spirit of March 18 1970 The other Khmer                            political leaders are as lackluster as Lon                                Nol none however gives the promise of the relative                            stability that he has managed to maintain The question of succession to                            the Marshal is under continuing review but with a major diplomatic                            confrontation in New York shaping up and major economic problems to be                            faced the Marshals continued presence appears essential assuming his                            health permits and he maintains his close cooperation with the Embassy                            and support for Prime Minister Long                                Boret15 The goal of course is a negotiated settlement Lon Nol is anathema to the other side                            whether it be Sihanouk who feels                            the Marshal betrayed him or the incountry Khmer Communist Party which                            remembers his repression at Samlaut in 1967 and views him as hopelessly                            corrupt and compromised with foreign powers The other side is doubtless                            keenly aware of the possibilities for political chaos if the Marshal                            leaves Their demand that he and a handful of others leave is                            reminiscent of the NVAVC insistence that Thieu and his government be removed                            before they would start serious peace talks This demand is a maximum                            position it is probably negotiable The other side of course should                            not be permitted to choose those who would represent the nationalist                            side in negotiations16 Lon Nol is no Nguyen Van Thieu but he has shown                            himself of sufficient stature to serve as a major bargaining counter                            The Marshal has told us at one point that he is willing to leave if his                            departure will help bring peace We should certainly not let him stand                            in the way of a peace settlement Before the United States asks him to                            make good on his word however his departure should be used to obtain a                            major concession from the other side in returnDean	19740814

frus1969-76v16d6	6 Telegram From the Embassy in the Soviet Union to the Department of State	None	1974-08-10 17:47:00	None	None	12296 Subj: USSoviet relations and the Presidential transition1 Summary I have little doubt that the Soviets believe President Ford will continue our policy of seeking a                        closer and more stable relationship with the USSR and I expect no major                        shifts in Soviet foreign policy either toward the US or in the                        international arena as a result of President Nixons resignation Nor do I think Nixons resignation will                        have much effect on Brezhnevs                        position within the Soviet leadership We can expect the Soviet regimewith                            Brezhnev at the helmto remain                        on a dtente course toward the US and the West in general End                        summary2 Brezhnev has felt most comfortable                        when dealing with Western leaders with whom he has developed a personal                        relationship Nixon Brandt and                            Pompidou were the three with whom                        that relationship was strongest Now all three are goneFrench President Georges                                Pompidou died in office on April 2 Willy Brandt resigned as West German                            Chancellor on May 7 The departure of Brandt and Pompidou                        caused some initial Soviet nervousness about the commitment of their                        successors to dtente accompanied by public and private Soviet assertions                        that Moscows course would be steadfast We expect the same to be true in                        the US case as the Soviets adjust to a new President3 Fortunately two factors in the US situation should encourage the                        Soviets in a continuing overall belief that the US remains committed to                        bilateral dtente First is the fact that Secretary Kissinger will remain in office In his                        person he exemplifies the continuity of US foreign policy andon a                        psychological levelhe is known and respected by the Soviet leadership4 Second is the fact that the Soviets have had time to prepare for the                        present situation While it took them longer than many to fully comprehend the possibility of Nixons fall                        the writing on the wall has been visible to them for several months Nixon                        did not depart in the full flood of his personal relationship with Brezhnev By the time of the summit                        meeting the Soviets probably had begun to consider him something of a                        wasting asset and several times during the visit they sidestepped too                        personal identification with him After the summit Soviet sources privately                        asserted to Westerners that more could have been accomplished in the                        strategic field if the President were not in domestic difficulties There is                        a large selfserving element in the claim but it is also likely that some                        Soviets believed it If so Moscow may be prepared to take a more serious                        and businesslike approach to SALT in the                        period ahead feeling that President Ford has the Congressional base to get approval of                        agreements reached5 The slow erosion of Nixons domestic position also gave the Soviets time                        to persuade themselves that Nixons policies were almost certain to survive                        him Through discussions in Moscow this spring and summer with Kennedy and Harriman on the Democratic sideand Scott and Richardson on the                            RepublicanSenator Edward Kennedy visited Moscow in                            April former Governor W Averell                                Harriman in MayJune former Attorney General Elliot                            Richardson visited the Soviet Union in JulyAugustthey could                        measure for themselves the continued strong support for the normalization                        process in the US6 Thus I believe the Soviets are reasonably well satisfied that we will                        keep on a dtente course This does not mean there will be no adjustment                        problems Given their innate conservatism and neophobia they may have some                        initial difficulty getting used to the new President They probably have                        some concern about the Presidents earlier political orientation which they                        may see as conservative in nature More basically they simply dont know                        him very well The message I delivered today got things off to a very good                            startSee Document                            4 An early meeting between the President and Dobrynin when he returns would also                        help It is possible of course that Brezhnev may be reluctant to seek with President Ford the kind of strong personal                        relationship he had with President Nixon and with Brandt and Pompidou                        The departure of all three has no doubt sobered him about the durability of                        personal ties with Western leaders Thrice bitten he may be inclined to                        move toward a somewhat more formal relationship with the US President                        This is not his natural bent however and the evidence thus far does not                        indicate any change in his approach7 A more complex problem involving Soviet perceptions of the US is how                        they will assess the entire Watergate drama in terms of its effect on the authority of the Executive                        branch of the US Government visvis the Congress Just as the MFN travail has educated the Soviets on the                        strength of Congress so should the Watergate affair cause them to revise                        even further upward their view of Congressional power They may therefore be                        concerned that Watergateand its culmination in the Nixon resignationhas                        had the effect of strengthening the hand of those in Congress who are                        illdisposed toward the Soviet Union They will have to balance such a                        concern against the knowledge that the President starts out with an                        excellent relationship with Congress based on his long experience there                        This mixture of factors will make the ExecutiveCongressional relationship                        of consuming interest to the Soviets8 What of the effect of the Presidential transfer on Soviet policy toward                        the US and in the overall international sphere Will there be an effort to                        take marginal advantage during the time of initial adjustment Or on the                        contrary a Soviet effort to give President Ford a honeymoon period I doubt that either will happen                        The circumstances of the resignation and succession should allow a                        transition of unique smoothness in the foreign policy field Our foreign                        policy apparatus is already in place and as capable as before of responding                        to any heightened Soviet challenge Moreover I doubt that the Soviets would                        wantparticularly at firstto risk actions which in their view might push                        the new President in a more hawkish direction Conversely I do not see any                        particular reason to believe that the Soviets will do President Ford any favors They will for example                        continue to press their interests vigorously in such areas as the Middle                        East Cyprus and the Mediterranean In sum I expect Soviet foreign policy to                        continueas ours willon a businessasusual basis unaffected in any                        major way by the succession9 Finally will Nixons resignation affect Brezhnevs own position in the leadership It seems                        doubtful While Brezhnev had been                        closely identified with Nixon the personal angle has been progressively                        muted for some time now and in any case Brezhnev never depended on it His policy toward the US                        and the West rested on the assumption that a closer relationship is in the                        Soviet national interest Unless US policy changes that assumption is not

highlevel                            discussions since ElShibibs arrival in Bonn was delayed Ibid From                            SECSTATENODIS In telegram 543 from Baghdad August 27 Lowrie sent a preliminary report on                            his meeting with Foreign Minister Taqa Ibid To SECSTATENODIS1 Summary:ForMin considers high level dialogue                        with US premature in view unchanged USG                        policies toward Arabs and in support of Israel and Iran Nevertheless improvement in some areas                        continuing Iranian aggression threatening peace of area and USG seems involved Despite negative reaction                        we should encourage continuing exchange of substantive information End summary2 Foreign Minister Taqa received me                        for almost one hour August 26 when informed that I had message from                        Secretary He listened very carefully and expressed appreciation He then                        engaged in halfhour monologue on why suggestion for high level meeting with                        Secretary was premature He emphasized that he was speaking personally                        because he had obviously not had time to consult his superiors He believed                        following represented current attitude of GOI toward USG:3 Taqa said Ambassador Shibibs                        contact with Secretary in New York in April had been accidental since they                        were seated next to each other at SecGen Waldheims luncheonSee Document 252                        Nevertheless something positive had come out of that meeting regarding                        stated USG policy toward Kurdish conflict                        and GOI had appreciated USG stand during Security Council debate                        However ForMin recalled that Shibib had                        told Secretary that deep differences separated US and Iraqi policies in                        Middle East and these would have to be narrowed before improvement in                        bilateral relations could take place ForMin then recalled meeting last January with Senator Abourezk                        and me Baghdad 003Telegram 3 from Baghdad                            January 6 reported the meeting between Senator James Abourezk and                                Taqa in which the latter                            explained the Iraqi position on the Middle East settlement National                            Archives RG 59 Central Foreign Policy                            Files no film number in which he had emphasized that GOI had nothing against US but only USG policies toward Arabs and that to extent                        there were positive changes in these policies GOI would respond He also mentioned message to him of October                        1972 from then Assistant Secretary Sisco suggesting dialogue and recalled that his answer then                        was that differences were too profound He agreed that different analyses                        can arrive at varying conclusions about extent to which USG Middle East policy has changed recently                        but as far as GOI concerned changes were                        not yet basic and GOI had no confidence                        whatsoever that Israel would withdraw from all occupied territory4 Taqa then stated in strong terms                        that possibility of improvement in bilateral relations was now complicated                        by second problem: Iranian assistance to Barzani and Kurds which is                        seriously threatening peace in the area If USG does not support what the Shah is doing he said it is                        difficult to believe that USG is unaware of                        it and possibly USG is providing indirect                        assistance to Kurds through the Shah Taqa said USG response to                        Shibib on this subject had been satisfying but GOI strongly believes                        Shah has aggressive intentions against Iraq It is difficult not to conclude                        that Washington knows of and supports Shahs attitude In answer to my                        question about what was contained in MFA                        note of August 25 on Iranian aggression mentioned in press ForMin said he would brief me on that5 He concluded his personal reaction to Secretarys message by saying that                        for above two reasons he frankly believed high level dialogue was                        premature He feared his meeting with the Secretary would be full of                        bitterness and sharp exchanges Apparently not wishing to go too far                            Taqa then emphasized that GOI had nothing against US only certain of                        its policies and this was evidenced by commercial dealings and fact that                        highest levels of GOI now seeking medical                        care in US when they could go anywhere in world Furthermore when he is                        instructed to personally take up matter with me such as Presidents wifes                        trip this also meant something He said GOI approved in principle of usefulness of dialogue with all                        countries and that we were in effect having dialogue now It was however                        premature to have high level dialogue6 With regard to confidentiality of contacts Taqa said GOI policy was to                        be strictly above board and it would not be concerned if such meetings                        become known He cited fact that when GOI                        signed contracts with American firms it announced it publicly This                        statement is simply not rpt not true I can                        recall no case in which GOI publicly                        announced that contract signed with an American firm Normal euphemism is                        foreign firm ForMins sensitivity on                        this point does I think indicate great caution that he or others must use                        in their dealings with USG lest they become                        vulnerable to charge of being proAmerican7 Taqa then turned to current                        situation on Iranian border which was subject of MFA note to diplomatic missions August 25 not including USINT He said Iran has concentrated 3                        armored divisions 2 infantry divisions and 2 infantry brigades along the                        entire length of border These troops as well as Iranian Air Force are on                        full alert He noted that Iran had not denied reports of alert but related                        it to Iraqi military actions This is ridiculous he said since Iraqi force                        engaged in internal action Taqa said                        with some feeling that if Shah or anyone else has idea of new Bangladesh in                        Iraq he is very mistaken Barzani is not representative of Kurds he is in                        his last days and those who are betting on him are betting on losing horse                            Taqa said that Istanbul meeting                        had been result of Iraqi initiative and was to resolve all outstanding                        problems Negotiations were proceeding not badly when Iranian troop                        concentration began and attacks hardened In response to my question about                        alleged Iraqi incursions on August 4 and 8 Taqa said there had seen no Iraqi incursions and that if                        they occurred at all there were very likely provocative acts by Kurds                        Kurds had he said previously                        engaged in this kind of activity wearing Iraqi Army uniforms on Turkish                        border8 In closing Taqa again emphasized                        that he had given me his personal views and that it is possible that the                        official reaction to Secretarys message might be different in which case he                        would communicate it to me9 Comment: Although flattered Taqa appeared to be apprehensive that his                        substantive communications channel with USINT had suddenly grown into suggestion for meeting with the                        Secretary Since relations with USG known                        to be subject of intraparty conflict my reading is that Taqa very fearful of getting out in front                        on this issue Current serious difficulties with Iran obviously made it even                        more difficult to react positively since same elements within regime                        apparently remain convinced that USG aiding                        Kurds directly or indirectly10 In view his strong remarks it would be most helpful if I could convey                            USG position on Kurdish conflict to                            ForMin including explicit denial of                        any USG assistance Despite Taqas negative reaction to high level                        dialogue I strongly recommend that Department encourage use of this channel                        to ForMins office for exchange of                        substantive informationLowrie	19740829

Secretary1 I believe we should now take the next step in the establishment of the                        Commission on Cooperation with Iran When you see the Shah you should draw                        on the following:2 I would have liked to have been able to visit Tehran earlier to reach                        formal agreement on our joint cooperation initiative with IranSee Document 58 but to                        my deep regret other commitments have prevented me from doing so either during my extended stay in                        the Middle East or in conjunction with the Presidential visits to the Middle                        East and Soviet Union During those visits my colleagues and I were                        gratified and strengthened by your firm support and deep understanding of                        our objectives3 At present I am tentatively planning a visit to the area in early                            fallKissinger did not visit Tehran until November

fully informed of my                        travel plans as they develop4 In the months that have passed since a joint commission was first                        broached I have come to believe that an economic commission does not                        adequately reflect the breadth of the relations between our two countries                        and that if you approve we should strive for a broader Commission on                        Cooperation which would encompass political defense cultural scientific                        and technological cooperation as well In this manner we would emphasize the                        importance each of us attaches to our ties With this concept in mind I                        have decided to act as US cochairman We do not believe that absolute                        symmetry is required in national representation on the Commission and we                        would continue to welcome the Minister of Economy and Finance or any other                        official you choose to be Iranian cochairman5 We wish to be responsive to any suggestions on the text of the proposed                        announcement draft text below

                 following agreement on the text A parallel announcement could be made in                        Tehran Second if the Shah considered it desirable and schedules permit I                        would be pleased to invite Minister Ansary or whomever the Shah designates to the US to                        discuss the initiative and sign the joint communiqu Finally we could                        await my visit to Tehran to announce the formation and first meeting of the                        Commission I would appreciate the Shahs views on the above and any other

the Shah said he wanted me to                        take a message to you I took notes as closely as I could while he was                        speaking The Shahs statement was as follows:B Please tell Ambassador Helms that                        Ambassador Zahedi has reported that                        Secretary Kissinger told him that he                        was encouraged by what the Shah had said about oil to Ambassador Helms and that Kissinger would be taking it up with the                        Shah when he comes to TehranAccording to a                            memorandum of conversation August 10 Kissinger responding to Zahedis query said that he did not think Helms had made much progress in his                            July 23 conversation with the Shah on oil but that I believe the                            approach of asking Iran headon to reduce oil prices is not the way We                            need a comprehensive discussion of all factors National

reported it otherwise after their talk about oil since                        Ambassador Helms knows what the                        Shahs policy is and it has not changedD HIM told Jamieson: A Either we                        fix a price for oil as we have done and HIM will defend this price in                            OPEC and will maintain that it will                        not go up except to compensate for possible future inflation of the prices                        of things OPEC countries have to buy and                        provided you do not give a higher return to the Saudis or Kuwaitis or B                        if the oil companies do give more to the Saudis or Kuwaitis or other Arabs                        as a result of 6040 or 100 percent participation the Shah will tell                            OPEC: All right lets stop at that                        price and any further increase will be pegged to prices of other major                        commodities and goodsE We will defend this in OPEC but we will                        not accept Secretary Simons principle that you will force prices down You                        are talking about taxing the oil companies to take away their windfall                        profits Thus your government would be getting a bigger profit from the                        price increase Yet you want us to get less Why should your government get                        more and we less We told Exxon we think 50 cents a barrel profit is enough                        for the oil companiesF If the oil companies give more to the Arabs through things like 100                        percent participation and the result is that the Arabs get something like                        11 a barrel then we are going to get it too We told the same thing to                            Jamieson and SteelG Your government and Jamieson and                            Steel now know that the Saudis                        fooled you They did not bring down the price of oil And if they had gone                        ahead with the auction the other OPEC                        members would have countered itH What raised oil prices above the 7 per barrel which I the Shah had                        originally suggested was the oil companies agreements with the Arabs Iran                        sells 80 percent of its oil production to the consortium Under the 6040                        participation the Arabs get 60 percent of their oil which the companies pay more for when they buy it back                        We will not accept less than the Arabs getI HIM said he will be reasonable and helpful along the lines he explained                        to Jamieson and Steel but he will not respond to pressure                            End of text2 Comment: Clearly issue here is exactly what                        Ambassador Zahedi reported to the                        Shah less than 1 line not declassified who

frus1969-76v30d126	126 Telegram From the Mission in Geneva to the Department of State	None	1974-08-09 19:40:00	None	None	5151 For the Secretary from Hartman Subj: Cyprus Phase IICallaghan Strategy1 We had a long exchange of assessments with Callaghan and his staff the afternoon of August 9 It                            led him to develop a strategy which he tentatively plans to use for                            concluding this phase of the Geneva talks and establishing a framework for ongoing negotiations                            The strategy is designed to take into account what UK and we have                            ascertained to date as to the positions for the various parties                            including those not directly involved such as Makarios and the USSR                            Callaghan also stated frankly that it is designed to meet his minimal                            political needs at home where he as Chairman of a Labor Party                            approaching elections simply cannot afford to be seen as completely                            selling out the new Greek Govt2 The basic elements of this strategy are simple and are set forth                            below3 On the constitutional side Callaghan understands the strength of Turkeys demand                            for a prior commitment in principle by Greece as well as Greek                            Cypriots to the concept of an autonomous Turkish Cypriot administration                            in a separate geographical area within an independent sovereign state                            Without a prior commitment along these lines Turkey may refuse to agree                            to ongoing negotiations and resort again soon to military acquisition of                            additional territory The wording of such a commitment whether it be                            verbal or written will be very important in order to minimize the                            political strain it will place on the Greek Govt and Clerides However the commitment in                            one form or another appears a sine qua non My advice to Gunes was that                            the Turks should not demand excessive precision Above all but for                            obvious reasons I did not say this yet to Gunes they should not insist                            at this session on a reference to the percentages of total land area or                            on a map of their zone I believe Callaghan understands the importance of trying to avoid                            a map approach to the regions in this phase4 To balance the constitutional commitment by Greece Callaghan will seek a commitment by                            Turkey on the phased reduction of troops to begin following the                            conclusion of this phase of the Geneva talks and the beginning of                            workinglevel discussions on constitutional arrangements Dept and                            Ankara will recall that Ecevit                            told me on August 4 that this was conceivable for him if the Greeks                            agreed in sufficient detail to the principle of the Turkish idea on                            geographic autonomous administration and that it could begin before                            final agreement on the new constitutional arrangements Among the                            questions almost certain to arise are those of use of word withdrawal                            timetable for reduction steps or phases numbers to be evacuated in                            each stage and linkage Greek numbers to Turkish numbers5 The ongoing talks for which the above commitments are preconditions                            are envisaged by Callaghan as                            taking place between Clerides and                                Denktash preferably without                            Greek Turkish British or UN                            representatives either participating or observing However there would                            be some agreed formula probably incorporated into a phase II Geneva                            declaration which states that the talks are not on previous                            intercommunal basis and that the two will report results of their efforts back to a tripartite                            Foreign Ministers meeting which would be set for the first week in                            September This would help meet Turkish concerns that the talks not drag                            out not be a reversion to the old intercommunal formula and 1960                            Constitution yet be associated with tripartite guarantors of 1960                            Constitution It would also help meet the UK and Greek concern that they not be associated directly                            with drawing up a new constitution for an independent state Callaghan is reluctant to have a British                            presence but he assumes that the parties will have unofficial advisers                            and plenty of guidance from Greece and Turkey Waldheim has told Callaghan that old format for talks is                            dead and he sees and wants no role for the UN A potential problem in Callaghans idea of framework is Clerides need for political support or                            cover which might cause him prefer more direct Greek                            participation6 Conclusion:A I find myself more and more forced into the role of professional                            optimist among these gloomy Joes After listening to Callaghan in London express his                            righteous indignation about even sitting down with fellows who break                            their word read Turkey I gradually nursed him with no great                            opposition on his part since he was really letting off steam to the                            point where he began to see his role as impartial chairman and not a                            moral arbiter of equities Each time we see each other however he has                            new bad news and half the conversation is nudging him back on the                            positive thinking road I congratulated him profusely on his first days                            efforts to help assure that he goes out of his corner tonight in an up                            mood He was in good mood after our long discussion but his final                            comment to me at short meeting a propos another Turk military action                            was an old Derbyshire miners saying more crudely put: Never let them                            kick you in the tail twice by the same bootB Needless to say both Gunes and Mavros are also pessimistic since both realize that an                            agreement means receding from their present positions They both seem to                            have a detached view that assumes things wont work out and it will be                            someone elses fault Gunes has been hauled back before by Ankara for                            being too soft and seems to have lost his zest for negotiations                                Mavros seems to fear he might                            be instructed by Caramanlis to make concessions which would weaken his                            political base What is lacking is the human element and I can only hope                            that Clerides and Denktash may supply it I am afraid my                            own appearance of optimism is only barely credibleC If Callaghans strategy is to                            succeed it is clear he will require our continuing support At some                            moment this may well require firm

statements by officials both here and                            in Ankara have reinforced our initial impression that Turkish Army                            intervened to protect the security of mainland and not assist local                            community except insofar as this relates to primary purpose Best                            indication this regard is total write off of enclaves located in                            southern half of island Despite repeated radio requests for aid so far                            as we aware Turks made no effort reinforce or resupply these areas                            Turk mainland Commander in Larnaca who exfiltrated in civilian dress                            via Dhekelia reportedly told British that his instructions were to                            offer token resistance before surrendering Said he had ample ammo and                            weapons to have continued fight for extended period This info which                            contradicts accounts put out by Turk Cypriot leaders largely confirmed                            by UNFICYP observation2 Thus while Turks had force to occupy entire island and divide it up                            as they wished they carefully limited operation to grabbing sufficient territory to insure that                            they would be in predominant position to dictate future status of an                            independent Cyprus As we read their intentions Turkey wants a federal                            confederal state and has little or no interest in creation of an                            independent Turk Cypriot ministate or move towards double enosis3 Either of latter two courses would run contrary to basic reason for                            intervention since by implication they would open the door to                            introduction of substantial Greek mainland forces onto island This                            would place Turkey in position of having southern ports and heartland                            cities again endangered or of going to war to take entire island                            destroying islands quasiindependence and facing prospect of                            protracted guerilla struggle4 Once negotiations get underway we expect Turkey to push for two                            canton confederal system trading territory of which it has excess for                            transfer of populations Believe also that Turkey will make every effort                            hold on to Famagusta port or at mininum insisting on Turkish                            communitys right to import freely from mainland with no hindrance from                            central govt Agreement on this may be key to getting Famagustas Greek                            Cypriot civilian population back to their houses This likely also be                            Turkish position on airport During bargaining sessions Turks may raise                            specter of independent Turk Cypriot state or float prospect double                            enosis but we expect this will be largely bluff What will not be bluff                            will be Turk demand maintain superior military force on island5 Danger is that goals frequently escalate following initial success of                            military actions To extent possible we should force Turks concentrate                            on their real security needs and long term interests in lieu immediate                            tactical gains Further military moves at this time rather than forcing                            Greeks to bargaining table would probably preclude meaningful                            negotiations for foreseeable future Fortunately atrocity rhetoric                            which had been running at high pitchwith attendent danger of possible                            rescue operationcooled noticeably today Aug 26 Odds on Turks                            mounting such move remain however high6 By now Turks have consolidated hold on occupied territory and                            internal security appears solid Question remains how to get negotiating                            process underway in shortest possible time Believe we should continue

destabilization this area7 Believe we should encourage two sides to focus on refugee problem and                            need to facilitate free movement populations While we have no illusions                            that many Greeks will move into Turkish area much of problem would be                            met if they could move into border areas and particularly if they could

In evaluation the Greek Governments decree to                            leave NATOTelegram 5665 from Athens August 14 transmitted the text of the                                announcement in which the Greek Government stated that NATO had failed to stem Turkey from                                creating a situation of conflict between two allies National                                Archives RG 59 Central Foreign Policy Files 1974 I                            believe it is useful to bear in mind a number of essential facts:1 The GOG and the Greek people are                            highly frustrated because of their inability to come to the aid of their                            fellow Greeks in Cyprus The conflict with Turkey is aggravated by the                            fact its historic adversary Turkey is involved The country is still                            vividly associated with four centuries of occupation and their own war                            of independence2 During the crisis it has felt let down by its NATO allies which it felt could have                            compelled Turkey to observe its ceasefire3 On the other hand I believe when the dust settles the basic elements                            tying Greece to the United States and its NATO allies will be given their appropriate weight They                            are a small country surrounded by hostile and potentially hostile                            forces Geographically they clearly need friends With democracy in the                            process of being restored many friends will be apparent4 Our traditionally close ties with this country and particularly its                            people will prove to be strong and I believe can be decisive They know that the American people are                            friendly and mean well The Greeks who are keyed into realities and                            others must or will realize the most difficult dilemma which has faced                            our government in the development of the crisisie the overriding                            necessity of seeking to bring our important allies together without                            irreparable damage in our or NATOs                            relations with either one in the imperative interest of Western security                            in the Eastern Mediterranean5 Their decision to remain in the Alliance French style does underline                            their understanding of the importance of the security protection which                            the alliance provides them against the potential dangers from the Warsaw                            Pact area I do not believe Caramanlis wants to act hastily with regard                            to unravelling their participation in NATO military structure where basic military elements are                            involved such as NAMFI our NATO use of                            Souda Bay etc Clearly however the practical implications of Greeces                            decision to withdraw from NATO and the                            speed with which the Greek Government proceeds to disengage from the                            military portions of the alliance will depend upon events in Cyprus and                            in Ankara over which Caramanlis and his proWestern colleagues have                            little or no control The US and NATO                            have become almost inevitably the scapegoats for Greek frustration                            over the Cyprus problem The sooner we can manufacture a settlement that                            meets Greek as well as Turkish minimum objectives and which is not                            injurious to Greek selfrespect the sooner we can begin to mitigate the                            effects of Greeces decision to loosen its military cooperation with                                NATO That decision is thus far                            rhetorical but it cannot remain so for long in the absence of US action                            which the Greeks will interpret as responsive to their concern about                            continued Turkish military advances on Cyprus and what they regard as a                            blunt and unheeding Turkish diplomatic posture6 In the short term we must act promptly along the following lines:A Demonstrate that we are mindful of Greeces importance to the US and                            the Western alliance and that we have not chosen Turkey over Greece                            Our desire to avoid public criticism of the Turks is logical in view of                            our intention to retain diplomatic leverage in Ankara but our                            evenhanded public posture has cost us leverage in Athens and has                            contributed to Greeces psychological estrangement I continue to                            believe that a trip by the Secretary to Ankara and Athens is                            indispensable to reverse the disturbing trends we are witnessing in                            GreeceB Demonstrate also that we understand Caramanlis domestic and personal                            problems that we regard him as a friend and want him to succeed in                            restoring strong and effective parliamentary government Here again a                            visit by the Secretary would do more than anything else in the short                            term Eventually and depending on future developments we should                            consider a visit by Caramanlis to the US In this connection I do not                            believe that a Mavros visit to                            Washington can accomplish much                                Mavros is the least articulate                            and most politically threatened of the present Greek leaders and the                            dialogue between our two governments requires a clearer channel of                            communication than he can provide7 In the longer term we should consider the following:A Once Greek relations with Turkey have quieted down and I must frankly                            say that many Greeks fear Turkish aims against Greece are not limited to                            Cyprus but other objectives such as the eastern Greek islands off the                            Turkish coast Thrace etc we should make every effort to be as                            forthcoming as possible in the Greek program to modernize their Armed                            Forces In this regard the military from the lowest to the highest                            ranks still prefer our equipment over that of our allies although                            sometimes delivery schedules and economics have forced them                            otherwiseB Some assistance in obtaining credit to carry them over the difficult                            balance of payments position they are facing could of course also help                            to underline our basic interest in a friendly and strong GreeceC With the exception of significant military modernization we should                            encourage our NATO allies similarly to                            act along the foregoing lines Summit level meetings with Caramanlis                            would be particularly in order as they become feasible Ambassador                            Vlachos told me last evening that Greece was deeply offended that Secty                            General Luns had refused to                            postpone his vacation sufficiently to be present at the NAC meetings to deal with the GreekTurkish                            crisis Steps need to be taken to repair this feeling of wounded                            philotimoD Forward movement in Greek association with the Common Market                            including the renewal of the remaining tranches of financial assistance                            suspended after the 1967 coup would of course be useful8 The foregoing are suggestive For the present we should make clear in                            every way possible American friendship and attachment to Greece When                            the GOG gets around to sorting out its                            policies we shall have ample opportunity to make clear to the Greeks the                            truly reciprocal security interest we have in the availability of                            facilities to our Armed Forces in Greece9 One word of caution in closing this message The left notably                                Andreas Papandreou will of                            course do everything possible to exacerbate Greeces relations with the                            US and the West We should therefore expect a major effort of these                            forces in key Greek sectors against the US position in Greece They                            will have their successes But I believe that with Caramanlis at the                            helm and other intelligent and Western oriented leaders such as                                Mavros Pesmazoglu etc if                            we act decisively and in depth and breadth our position in Greece can                            be maintained in its

NOTAL b                            Athens 5665In telegram 5653 August 14                                    Tasca reported that the                                Greek Foreign Ministry would announce

       telegram 5665 see footnote 2 Document                                    20Summary: GOG decision to withdraw from                                NATO probably taken without full                            realization of its impact Earlier experience however suggests that                                GOG contemplates a relationship with                            other NATO countries like that of                            France but a baserights relationship with USG similar to Spanish example Since GOG has not thought through impact of                            withdrawal we can only estimate impact on US security interests in                            Greece End Summary1 Action taken by GOG August 14 to                            withdraw from North Atlantic Treaty Organization while continuing to                            adhere to the North Atlantic Treaty clearly has farreaching                            implications We attempt in this cable to give initial assessment of                            meaning of Greek action and its implications for USGreek security                            relationship As situation matures we will have further comments2 Following commentary is based on assumption that any clash between                            Greece and Turkey would be confined for all essential purposes to Cyprus                            and that it would be brief leaving mistrust and unhappiness between two                            countries but without legacy of hatred toward each other and bitterness                            toward bystanders which fullscale war would engender Latter                            eventuality would require considerable reevaluation of US position in                            Greece3 We believe this decision like the January 1973 decision to forgo                            further grant military assistanceSee Document 1 was taken without adequate                            thought to ramifications for Greeces future security needs We doubt                            that impact of decision on NATO                            infrastructure program or implications for future operations of NAMFI Souda Bay or NAWTC at                            Timbakion for example were fully taken into account We assume that as                            a minimum GOG intends to withdraw Greek                            military personnel from NATO commands                            in Brussels Naples and Izmir to cease participating in various NATO committees etc involved in military                            activities and to align Greeces defense activities with its own                            concept of Greeces national interests and not necessarily in accordance                            with NATO plans Whether withdrawal                            would go beyond this is matter we doubt GOG has thought through and might in any event depend upon                            outcome of current events4 Whether or not Greeces decision is irrevocable and speed and extent                            to which it is implemented clearly depend on our ability to defuse the                            Cyprus crisis and formulate a settlement that Greeks can live with                            Should Greece contemplate reintegration we do not believe that                            assignment of Greeks to NATO                            headquarters on Turkish soil would be possible for the foreseeable                            future Thus reintegration might be accomplished in headquarters in                            Naples or Brussels but not in Izmir5 For Greece as for Turkey NATO has                            always meant a multilateralized relationship with the United States                            There is considerable reason to think that Greece intends by its                            withdrawal action to put pressure on alliance but not to give up the                            central relationship with the United States In this scheme of things                                GOG doubtless believes that Greeces                            strategic position is such that USG will                            wish to continue close security relationship within or without NATO and we presume that this Greek                            judgment is not wide of the mark Question then is what kind of                            relationship would GOG envision and how                            would this accord with United States view of USGGreek security relationship under North Atlantic Treaty                            but outside NATO6 Our experience in negotiating with GOG                            on base rights and related issues is that GOG feels that fundamental changes are overdue Although                            this feeling manifested itself under two authoritarian regimes which                            preceded current government it evidently developed from Greek                            perceptions which are not necessarily dependent upon shared views on                            best means of governing Greece They seem to be held both by Greek                            military leaders and Foreign Ministry Salient features of these                            changes as predicted by our recent experiences would include:a Existing as well as additional US facilities and other manifestations                            of US presence should not result in any cost to GOG This conviction results from reappraisal by Greeks of                            advantages and disadvantages for Greece of Alliance relationship                            stimulated basically by unfortunate 10 local currency deposit                            requirement and imminent expiration of grant military assistance which                            together prompted Greece early in 1973 preemptively to announce                            renunciation of further grant aid We have sensed and experienced                            results of this in several contexts but in future would expect further GOG demands to restore what it perceives as                            financial balanceb Restoration of balance might be expected to take form of quid pro quo                            for US use of Greek facilities which would put Greece in category of                            base rights countries Spain is model GOG probably has in mind and Spanish experience might be                            quite relevant in our future security relationship with Greecec NATOSOFA and bilateral USGreek                            implementing agreement concerning jurisdiction over US military                            personnel might well be challenged with elimination of latter as first                            objective Since other provisions of NATOSOFA have proven to be troublesome in                                GOGs views its general                            applicability might also well be challenged and a superseding bilateral                            more favorable to Greece demandedd Assertion of close Greek control over unilateral US activities such                            as special reconnaissance missions might also be anticipated A                            heightened desire to avoid irritating Arab countries could well emerge                            from a Greek attempt to broaden its foreign policy base in wake of                            withdrawal decision and humiliation on Cyprus making reconnaissance                            missions particularly vulnerable7 Greeces withdrawal from NATO also                            could have implications in following areas and probably in other ways                            not immediately called to mind:a 11 lines not declassifiedb US Sixth Fleet visits to Greek ports might be less welcome in the                            short term but their basic acceptability from Greek point of view should                            not lessen significantly in longer term Dormant Phase II of homeporting                            would probably be far less acceptable to GOG in aftermath of likely unhappy resolution of Cyprus                            problem Presence of Sixth Fleet in eastern Mediterranean will still be                            seen as important to Greeces defense against threat from north but it                            will take some time for Sixth Fleet to get rid of onus for failure to                            intervene to stop Turkish invasion of Cyprus however unrealistic or                            unfair we know that Greek view to bec Future of multilaterallyused NATO                            installations on Greek soil NAMFI and NAWTC is very uncertain It is                            difficult to envision continued functioning of these installations with                            Greece outside of NATO yet                            considerable value they have for integrated training argues in favor of                            their continued operation If this could be accomplished it would keep                            Greeks engaged with NATO in meaningful                            fashion and thereby make possible reintegration decision that much                            easierd Impact on NATO infrastructure program                            is not clear to us We presume infrastructure funds could not be                            utilized to maintain the many Greek facilities erected through this                            program Any construction USG might                            normally wish to have funded through infrastructure presumably would                            have to be unilaterally funded nowe Greek participation in NATO exercises                            would again seem to be excluded for foreseeable future but slack might                            be taken up to great extent expanded program of bilateral exercises with                            US Navy or even multilateral exercises excluding Turkish units                            without NATO identificationf Status of JUSMAGG should not be                            altered so long as Greece continues its extensive weapons modernization                            program JUSMAGGs charter predates                            Greeces original entry into NATO and                            it plays a significant role in assisting Hellenic Armed Forces                            modernization effort so it should not suffer as result of recent                            withdrawal decision8 As indicated above as GOG assesses                            meaning of its own decision and we are able to discuss matter with                            contacts at various levels we shall refine this

indicates                            that Greece shall recover forthwith over her entire territory airspace                            and territorial waters full exercise of her sovereignty which was                            heretofore limited on account of her participation in NATO                            and as a result of the permanent presence on Greek soil of foreign

face the need to begin considering approaches to be taken in                            dealing with GOG based on careful                            consideration of implications of full or partial Greek withdrawal from                                NATOs integrated military                            structure as well as possible steps to encourage Greece to reconsider                            its position We are considering implications for US facilities in                            Greece and will provide further guidance as appropriate on this                            aspect2 Accordingly you should initiate informal bilateral discussions with                                SYGLuns and selected allies UK FRG                            Italy and Belgium or Netherlands on implications of Greek decision Our                            initial thinking is that France should be excluded from this circle                            since France is not a member of the DPC                            though we would welcome your views on holding talks also with French at                                NATO For the present and in order                            to avoid any indications to Greece that other allies are acting                            precipitately all discussions should be conducted on a highly                            confidential basis In initiating discussions we believe USNATO could draw appropriately on the                            excellent analysis contained USNATO                            4524 identifying it as Mission analysis3 A principal objective of consultations would be to consider with key                            allies development of a common damage assessment outlining the impact                            on the NATO and Greek defense postures                            of Greek withdrawal and defining the magnitude of increased tasks which                            will have to be shared to close resulting defense gap In the course of                            such a study it may also be possible to identify pressure points to                            be used in discussions between the other DPC allies and Greece on the shape of future defense                            cooperation in the event of Greek withdrawal We see as the benefit of                            this the development of a heightened awareness on the part of other                            allies of the potential implications of Greek withdrawal and of                            coordinated tactics aimed at promoting Greek reconsideration of their                            decision4 In the course of discussions you may draw as appropriate on the                            following additional considerations5 Frances withdrawal from NATO                            followed several years of signaled French dissatisfaction and partial                            withdrawals of French forces ie naval from participation in NATO activities Postulated on a                            calculated Gaullist policy France sought and gained greater                            independence and expanded its global as well as European influence at                            least partially because of its break with NATO Greeces proposed withdrawal however appears based                            almost entirely on a desire to find a public scapegoat for its humiliation by Turkey This                            suggests that basically cosmetic facesaving devices eg                            restructuring of subordinate AFSOUTH                            commands to separate Greek and Turkish forces could after Cyprus                            tempers cool greatly help Greek leadership rationalize a                            reconsideration to their public We strongly hope the Greek leadership                            over time may conclude that withdrawal from NATOs military structure would not only expose Greece to                            greater pressures from the Warsaw Pact but also weaken it further in                            relation to Turkey which already has shown an interest in assuming some                            of Greeces former NATO military                            responsibilities in the Eastern Mediterranean These factors would                            likely add to other pressures on the Greek Government to find ways over                            time of perpetuating as many links as possible with the alliance in                            contrast to the French position6 Even if it withdrew from integrated military activities Greece would                            remain bound by the provisions of the North Atlantic Treaty and would                            sit in the NAC However it would be                            reasonable to assume that as principal gestures of disengagement                            Greece like France would not continue to sit in the Defense Planning                            Committee DPC nor would it assign                            officers except in a liaison capacity to the NATO military headquarters We assume too that absence                            from the DPC would also entail Greek                            nonparticipation in NDAC and the                                NPG 1 line not                                declassified7 Beyond this we agree with the view expressed in USNATO 4524 that because of its                            economic weakness and exposed military position Greece may seek to                            engage itself more fully than France in other institutions and                            activities associated with the integrated military structure of the                            alliance Greece may judge that by staying somehow linked in bilateral                            military arrangements with the US it is preserving a central element of                            its security policy 4 lines not                            declassified8 For both military and financial reasons we suspect that Greece is                            likely to seek continued involvement in NADGE NATOs air defense early warning and other communications                            systems and NATO weapons research and                            development It would also clearly be in Greeces interest to continue                            to participate in the infrastructure program now paying for military                            construction in Greece at the rate of about 15 million per quarter                            However it is difficult to see how Greece could continue to benefit                            from the infrastructure program as long as Greece refused to be part of                            the NATO integrated military structure                            a prerequisite to having facilities qualify under NATO infrastructure criteria Greece would                            also likely be interested in continued participation in NATO military exercises and in                            maintaining the closest possible liaison with NATO military authorities charged with developing                            integrated defense plans for southern Europe Such arrangements are                            conceivable though they would complicate planning and implementation                                and in any event Turkey                            would remain in a position to constantly exercise a check on the quality                            and quantity of Greek participation9 It is also possible that Greece would agree that the NATO air weapons training center and                                NATO missile firing installations                            could be made available on some reimbursable basis to NATO forces Similarly it might be                            prepared to continue operation on NATOs behalf of naval communications facilities Too the                            Greeks like France likely will be prepared to provide overflight rights                            However the Greeks cannot undercut the alliance military posture to the                            extent the French could and still can by prohibiting such flights10 While recognizing the possibility of creating a unique relationship                            tailored for Greece and willing to carefully consider any Greek                            proposal the risks of encouraging Greece to assume it will continue to                            have all of its previous benefits without past costs is that it would                            set an example for other allies and thus over the longer term could                            lead to a serious degradation of NATOs                            military structure Thus it would seem preferable to leave Greece in                            the position of demandeur should it withdraw and to deal with Greek                            requests for continued military cooperation in a way that would lead                            Greece back to full military integration As the Secretary stated on                            August 19:  we assume that all of our allies including Greece join                            in collective defense in their own interests We are willing to                            strengthen these common alliance ties and to help the Greek Government                            in any way possible We will not be pressured by threat of withdrawal                            from the alliance11 Insofar as work of the alliance at NATO headquarters and elsewhere is concerned we believe                            that it should move forward insofar as possible on a business as                            usual basis As issues arise we would be prepared to deal with them as                            required Moreover we recognize for example that military exercises                            may have to be altered or cancelled and we are already dealing with                            these case by case12 In sum it should be up to the Greek Government to take the                            initiative to alter its relationships with its allies we must avoid                            even the suggestion of making GOG take                            undesirable decisions because of perceived pressures by her NATO allies Finally it will be in our                            interest to extend as long as possible discussions with Greece on its                            future NATO role in order to give time                            for tempers to cool and to avoid prematurely closing doors to Greek                            participationIngersoll	19740830
