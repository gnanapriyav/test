Iraqi regime                        after the rapprochement with Iran and end of the Kurdish war reftel emphasized the dominant position of                            Saddam Hussein the relative                        improvement in the Western position visvis the Soviets and the lessening                        of Baath ideological warfare against fellow Arabs Two months later those                        conclusions remain valid but it now seems clear that Saddams policies have                        provoked more criticism and potential opposition than he anticipated He                        appears to be dealing with it by taking a temporary step backwards to                        refurbish Iraqs revolutionary image and assure that his militant followers                        are not attracted elsewhere In this situation continuing US patience and                        a capability to separate the substance of Iraqs policies from its rhetoric                        is strongly recommended End summary2 MFADirGen of Political Affairs Ibrahim                        alWali told me in confidence on July 3 that GOI had been soundly criticized by Communists and others for                        hypocrisy of expanding economic relations with US and for receiving                            David Rockefeller Senator                            Kennedy and exSenator

          specify others implication was they were Baath Party members In a                        conversation on July 10 Dr Abdullah alSayyab advisor to Minister of Oil                        and Iraqi representative on Governing Board of OPEC told me much the same thing In commenting on why it was                        premature for USIraqi bilateral discussions on oil matters at technical

bilateral USIraqi discussions on energy if the                            Iraqi Government agreed National Archives RG 59 Central Foreign Policy Files D7501550948                        alSayyab said suspicion of USG is still                        widespread among certain elements and any such discussions could be                        misinterpreted as proAmerican gesture AlSayyab cited recent example of                        US oil company executive who had offered to come to Baghdad to present                            INOC 5000 worth of technical                        publications Reaction had been to insist he mail them3 Commercial relations and reception of prominent Americans is only one                        aspect of Saddam Husseins policies                        that have met opposition Rapprochement with Saudi Arabia Jordan Iran and other reactionaries                        displacement of Soviets in economic field by West and more realistic                        approach to ArabIsraeli conflict best exemplified by Sadat visit and                        absence of criticism of Egypt are all probably being used against him                        Opposition elements fall into three categories: A ICP supported by USSR which                        believes dramatic expansion of Western economic presence and developing                        IranianIraqiSaudi cooperation in Gulf are aimed at eliminating Soviets                        from area B militant and less sophisticated Baathis who are products of                        closed system and radical rhetoric They have found it difficult to digest                        180 degree policy shift on Iran rapprochement with reactionary Arabs and                        particularly welcoming of Americans whom they are still being told are no 1                        enemy They are receptive no doubt to accusations that Saddams policies are                        hypocritical and that he is selling out the revolution and C perhaps most                        dangerous group is higher level party figures who most resent and fear                        Saddams successes and predominance Identity of such potential enemies is                        difficult to establish and their existence is evidenced mainly by inference                        from statements and actions of Saddam They probably include some members of                        panArab party leadership perhaps some followers of leftist ideologue Abdul                        Khaliq asSammaraie still under house arrest since his implication in June                        30 1973 abortive coup and personal rivals from Tikrit mafia4 Above groups even acting in concert are not believed to represent                        serious threat to regime in short term and if Saddam chose to crush them he                        could probably do so in short order Perhaps fearing such a move which                        would be traditional Iraqi method of dealing with rivals large portion of                            ICP is believed to have gone                        underground within past six months Saddam is believed to feel use of force                        would result in renewal of domestic violence and political instability that                        could reduce longevity of his regime Instead he appears to have opted for                        policy of persuasion gentle coercion and payoffs During past three months                        Saddam has made major effort to reassure the militants and to undercut                        allegations of his enemies Among more significant moves have been:A Saddams March visit to Moscow Baghdad 324 and 409B Saddams May visit to four Eastern European countries Baghdad 478C IraqiSoviet economic accord of May 28 Baghdad 606D GOI association with Libyan position on                            ME during Jalloud visit Baghdad

             D7502420432K VP Maaroufs July visit to China and                        North Korea5 All of above actions are remarkably similar to policies adopted during                        June 1972March 1973 nationalization struggle when strategic alliance with                        Soviet Union was played as keystone of Iraqi policy However as most of                        reftels point out recent actions are even more lacking in substance than                        those of 197273 Concurrently with above Saddam has taken other actions                        that have received scant publicity but are of substance and long range                        significance most notably the conclusion of treaty with Iran Baghdad                            642See footnote 3                                Document 290 July 2 border accord with Saudi Arabia                        June 26 economic accords with Jordan improved relations with Gulf states                        and continued expansion of economic relations with West There is therefore                        no reason to believe at this time that Saddam is letting domestic opposition                        and Soviet displeasure divert him from pursuit of independent and realistic                        policies directed at achieving rapprochement with neighbors rapid economic                        development and creating regional environment in which Iraqs vital                        interest will be protected and it will be capable of playing influential                        role6 Significance for US: If above analysis is correct and Saddam Hussein is in fact in delicate                        period of trying to deal with opposition without jeopardizing positive                        accomplishments of past year early improvement of relations with US will                        almost certainly be postponed US has been chief whipping boy for so many                        years that Saddam himself may have overestimated how far he could go toward                        the US and West in general before being accused of hypocrisy and selling                        out In any case he now appears to be following Lenins strategy of two                        steps forward one step back How far it will go and how long it will last                        remains to be seen It goes without saying that progress toward a ME settlement could be a crucial factor as far                        as Iraqi attitudes toward US are concerned for this remains the most                        emotionallycharged issue in Iraq and Saddam cannot allow himself to become                        vulnerable on it7 For time being I strongly recommend against visits by prominent Americans                        or other overt actions that could be perceived here as expression of US                        pleasure with recent developments There is however no reason why we                        cannot continue commercial business as usual More than ever before we                        should concentrate on the substance of Iraqi actions not their rhetoricLowrie	19750712

considerations                            notably the limitation on funds available the cost and time required                            for shipment and the risk of leaks that arises if large quantities of                            matriel are sent all at once I stressed the importance of the last                            point noting the need to move in such a way as to avoid exposure which                            could seriously harm our efforts to help Mobutu said he understood these considerations but that                            he considered that much less than the equipment from five of his                            parabattalions four for Roberto and one for Savimbi would not rpt                            not redress the balance He also reiterated his hope that the items                            already sent Angola from his mobilization reserve as well as the key                            items from his paratroops which we cannot supply in the present                            emergency program would be replaced subsequently3 I said it was important that I provide Washington with as precise a                            view as possible of his order of priorities within the broad priority                            categories of equipment his generals had given us on his instruction                            it is clear This so we could determine the most useful types of                            assistance both for a dollar amount not                                declassified program and for any aid we might be able to                            provide above that I then reviewed with Mobutu the list provided by the generals and he                            indicated how he would refine his relative priorities His most urgent                            need remains 5000 M16 rifles with onetwo months ammunition all of which he hopes                            can be air shipped to Zaire as soon as possible His second priority is                            antitank guns to replace more than has already been shipped south to                            counter the Sovietsupplied armored vehicles he said were having                            devastating effect on the FNLA                                Mobutu went on to designate                            a number of other priority requirements from the list and indicated                            which should be shipped by air and which by sea We have incorporated                            his views both in a dollar amount not                                declassified package and in a larger package which we have                            developed as requested reftel 1 lines not declassified4 In discussing Zairian military aid to Angola I took the occasion to                            remind Mobutu about US                            restrictions on the transfer from one country to another of equipment I                            had in mind his paratroopers have some old MAP equipment supplied under MAP Mobutu said he                            understood this and reiterated his assurance that no US matriel no                            matter how old it might be would be sent to Angola5 Mobutu commented on the                            importance of moving ahead with political action programs noting that                            he had already instructed appropriate security and intelligence                            officials to sit down less than 1 line not                                declassified and start working up plans In this regard                                Mobutu said he had Amins assurance that as chairman of                            the forthcoming OAU summit he would                            see to it that the Soviets are appropriately taken to task at the                            meeting for their intervention in Angola Mobutu intends also to work behind the scenes there to                            encourage other such criticism6 Mobutu did not have much news                            from Angola However he was concerned by reports that two more Soviet                            vessels have delivered military equipment to the MPLA I noted reports I had seen recently                            reflecting adversely on the conduct of certain FNLA officials and troops in Luanda Mobutu acknowledged this has been a                            problem and said he would admonish Roberto again on this matter7 I told Mobutu that I intended                            to return Washington July 25 and would press for earliest possible                            decision Mobutu reiterated need                            for urgent action The Soviets are continuing to send arms into                            Angola he said while we are sitting here talking8 Recommendation: As noted para 3 we are sending                            separately the composition of two possible packages: one which meets the                            current dollar amount not declassified ceiling                            and the other which incorporates Mobutus most urgent minimum requirements and according                            our rough estimates amounts to dollar amounts not                                declassified I wish to make clear Mobutu would not rpt                            not regard what we could send under the dollar amount                                not declassified program as enough to redress the balance in                            Angola As it is important that we start to move just as soon as                            possible I urge that Washington agencies give top priority to final                            reviewing and costing out of both packages to permit a decision in the                            next few days on what can be our highest level I urge that the decision                                be in favor of a larger                            than dollar amount not declassified dollar                            program so that we will have a real impact on Angolan situationAndrew	19750724

with Saudi Arabia and Iran on the following                        approach:2 Basic plan: Group of 10 to meet first with the same level of                        representation as at the April Prepcon                        and agree on all the important questions cited below before giving way to                        the group of 27 at the Ministerial level The larger group would formally                        launch the three commissions on energy other commodities assistance to                        least developed countries3 Important questionsto be resolved in advance:A Enlarged launching group: It appears that we will likely end up with 27                        participants8 industrialized nations 8 OPEC and 11 LDCsto be                        selected by the respective groups The chairman of the group of 27 should be                        from a neutral country not France rotated amongst the 3 participating                        groups or possibly from the UNB Commissions: Three separate commissions to be formed on energy other                        commodities and least developed countries relations with financial and                        monetary questions to be considered in each Hopefully Yamanis demand for a separate commission                        on finance and monetary matters can be resolved by agreeing to set up a                        subcommittee under the energy commissionC Commission participants: Participants in each commission to be selected                        from among the group of 27 countries by use of objective criteria modified                        as may be required to meet anticipated political pressure These criteria                        would justify US membership in all three                        commissions but preclude multiple membership for most of the 27D Guidelines for commission programs: General outline of the scope of each                        commissions activities to be set for them based largely on the draft agenda considered at the April                            Prepcon more detailed agendas to                        be developed by each commission Each commission would proceed at its own                        individual pace reflecting the nature of its tasks and relationships with                        other international fora operating in the same fieldE Commission linkage: Some form of regular contact will be maintained                        between commissions and with other fora dealing with these subjects In                        spite of our continuing opposition it appears likely that most governments                        will insist on some arrangement for progress reports back to the group of                        27 In this event we should push for a loose arrangement without fixed                        schedules and with agreement that there is to be no substantive debate in                        the group of 27 so as to prevent its becoming a miniUN Both Saudi Arabia and Iran would support this                        restriction4 Anticipated schedule:A Announcement: The plan for resumption of the producerconsumer dialogue                        and the date of the Group of 10 meeting to be announced not later than                        August so as to precede and influence the UNGA Special Session commencing September 1 and the OPEC meeting commencing September 24B Group of 10 meeting: To take place in Paris in early October Yamani is still pushing for August but                        Iran firmly supports our view that more time is required for careful                        preparationC Group of 27 Ministerial: To take place at a site to be decided in                        December at least 3060 days after the Group of 10 meeting to allow for                        selection of the 17 additional participants issuance of invitations and                        conclusion of detailed arrangements5 The foregoing represents my judgment as to the basis on which Saudi Arabia                        and Iran would support resumption of the producerconsumer dialogue My                        meetings with Venezuela Brazil and possibly Algeria during early and                        midJuly could indicate the desirability of some change in this plan to                        ensure the support of these key developing countries which we would want                        before proceeding with this programIngersoll	19750702

                Dialogue1 Please pass following message to Davignon from Assistant Secretary Enders2 I want to give you our assessment of the current state of play on the                        resumption of the dialogue following our talks with the French during                        Secretary Kissingers visit to Paris                        last ThursdayKissinger met with Sauvagnargues in Paris on July 9 They agreed that by                            the end of August before the next OPEC meeting and before the UN Special Session they should announce that they                            recommended the resumption of a producerconsumer dialogue They also                            discussed establishing one commission to tackle commodity issues which                                Kissinger said the United                            States preferred except for energy Kissinger also said that by the time of the UN meeting the US Government would                            overcome internal differences and settle on a unified commodity policy                            Ibid Records of Henry                                Kissinger Lot 91D414 Box 11 Classified External

Central Foreign                            Policy Files P84008417633 The French now agree that the dialogue should resume with a second meeting                        of the Kleber group This meeting would be followed by a conference at                        Ministerial level of the 27 countries tentatively agreed upon in April Both                        meetings would be short thoroughly prepared and with the purpose of                        establishing 3 commissions on energy raw materials and development4 On the question of timing the French have come around to the view that it                        is not feasible to try to reconvene the preparatory meeting before the                            UN Special Session They showed some                        initial preference for a meeting before the September OPEC session but I believe they now agree                        that this is also impracticable and that we should aim for early October                        They would share the IEA view that there                        should be some announcement of the reconvening of the preparatory meeting                        and subsequent timetable before the UN                        Special Session ie before the end of August On this basis we would                        announce within the next several weeks that the preparatory meeting would                        reconvene in early October The Ministerial meeting would follow within                        approximately 60 days and the commissions could begin their work before the                        end of the year5 On the basis of our bilateral talks with the Iranians Saudis                        Venezuelans and Brazilians we are confident that this general approach on procedure and timing will be                        acceptable to them However there are still some key points which remain to                        be resolved both with the French and with the Seven On the question of                        participation the French are somewhat vague about our earlier understanding                        reached in April that the 19 LDCs represented at the conference of 27 would                        include 8 OPEC members We believe this is                        an important condition and one which we must nail down before convening a                        second Prepcon The French also want to                        leave the question of membership on the commissions themselves in the hands                        of the two groups the 8 industrialized representatives and the 19 LDCs We                        continue to prefer objective criteria for determining membership on the                        commissions and have received tentative endorsement of this approach from                        Venezuela6 On the critical question of the autonomy of the commissions and whether                        they will report back to a second conference of the 27 the French are now                        talking in terms of a stock taking meeting of the 27 some 6 months after                        the first meeting and the launching of the commissions They argue that this                        second meeting can be kept both short and procedural in nature We continue                        to have reservations on this score If the large conference can meet every                        six months soon it will be meeting for six months at a time and will have                        practically preempted the dialogue thereby condemning it to sterility But                        we recognize that pressure is building for some kind of a schedule and this                        is a key issue we will want to discuss at the next Governing Board                        meeting7 The role of the IEA in the resumed                        dialogue is also still at issue In our view agreement to reconvene the                        preparatory meeting in the same format means by definition that the IEA will be present as an observer We can                        seek through previous negotiation to establish the cosmetics of this                        presence in such a way as to minimize the possibilities for confrontation                        with the Algerians But we can not agree to exclude the IEA from the preparatory meeting As for the                        Ministerial meeting of 27 we should consider in the IEA whether in fact IEA presence is required since the scope of that meeting would                        cover all economic relations between industrialized and developing                        countries On the other hand the IEA must                        be present as an observer with the right to speak in the energy                        commission8 The French have told us that they plan to circulate soon to the Group of                        Ten a paperNot found laying out what in                        their judgment could be a basis for resuming the dialogue This would be the                        vehicle through which agreement among the Ten would be crystallized and                        assurance obtained against another failure If we receive the French paper                        before the July 28 Governing Board meeting we would not plan to respond to                            it formally until after we have                        had an opportunity for full IEA                        consultation at that meeting In the meantime we will continue our                        bilateral contacts with the Seven and Under Secretary Robinson now plans to visit Algeria during                        the week of July 219 At the July 28 Governing Board meeting I think we should try to reach                        agreement on the timetable as well as the basic questions of format and                        procedure In particular I think we will have to reach a position on the                        reporting back issue which I view as the key unresolved pointAccording to a message from Enders to Kissinger at the July 28 IEA Governing Board meeting consultations with other

                      approach outlined below:1 The Group of Ten which met in Paris in April to reconvene again in Paris                        on October 6 for a meeting to establish the basis for selection of an                        additional seventeen participants thereby expanding the group to                        twentyseven Eight would be from the industrialized nations and nineteen                        from developing nations of which eight will be members of OPEC The industrialized and developing                        nations will each select their additional members on a basis assuring a                        properly representative expanded groupThe Group of Ten will also agree on the formation of three commissions to                        deal with the problems of A energy B other commodities and C                        developmenteach with not more than fifteen participants selected from the                        group of twentysevenIn addition the Group of Ten will select the site for the meeting of the                        enlarged Group of TwentySeven presumably Geneva or Paris and the chairman                        for that meeting which could be from a neutral country or a revolving arrangement acceptable                        to the Group of Ten2 The Group of TwentySeven will meet thirty to sixty days later at the site                        selected and after the additional seventeen participants have been selected                        and formally invited This will be a short twoday meeting at Ministerial                        level Its primary objective will be to confirm the decisions reached at the                        Group of Ten meeting for establishment of A three separate commissions                        B brief guidelines for commission work and C reportingback                        procedures3 The three commissions will be formed on the basis previously agreed by the                        Group of Ten Industrialized and developing nations will each select their                        representatives on these commissions approximately preserving the                        eighttonineteen relationship within the group of twentyseven General                        criteria reflecting degree of direct involvement in the subject matters of                        each commission will be applied in this selection process with the                        understanding that the results must be generally acceptable to the group of                        twentyseven Each commission will maintain a free exchange of information                        with the other commissions and with other international fora as considered                        appropriate by each commissionAny of the three commissions may establish a subcommission for consideration                        of monetary and financial matters related to its subject area4 The Group of TwentySeven will reconvene again at Ministerial level after                        twelve months from the launching of the commissions to receive progress                        reports from all three commissions This will be a twoday meeting with the                        understanding that there will be no substantive debate At this meeting                        consideration will be given to possible future action on the part of any or                        all of the commissionsIn addition we are in agreement on the status of observers with both OPEC and IEA                        invited to sit behind a single plate labeled observers at the Group of Ten                        meeting with the understanding that no observer will speak There will be no                        observers at the meetings of the Group of TwentySeven but both OPEC and IEA                        will be invited to participate in energy commission meetings with the right                        to speakYou and I have worked together intimately with a mutual desire to see a                        resumption of the dialogue for which you served as host at the initial                            Prepcon in Paris last April In                        this spirit and with the same desire to maintain the close cooperation                        between us we would support your issuance of a letter to the members of the                        Group of Ten which contains the terms of the plan outlined above on which we                        are now agreed and which makes clear that its acceptance by all                        participants is a condition for issuance of invitations to a reconvened                        meeting We share your conviction that there must be a commitment to this                        plan in advance to avoid confusion                        which could threaten the success of this meeting Our detailed bilateral                        discussions with key participants could be helpful in guiding this approach                        to avoid unnecessary problems I hope that you and I will continue to                        maintain close and continuing contact as this important process evolves                        Warmest regards Henry A                        KissingerKissinger	19750724

cliffhanger to the end CSCE confirmed July 30 opening date for Stage III summit completed all its substantive and procedural work reached consensus on the final documents of the conference and closed Stage II at 4:00 am on July 21 Belgrade was accepted as the site for the two followup meetings set for 1977 End summary2 Stage IIIcoordinating committee confirmed July 30 date for Stage III in early morning hours of July 19 after key remaining substantive questions had been settled3 Final actThe Final Act of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe signed on August 1 1975 at Helsinki is in Department of State Bulletin September 1 1975 pp 323350By July 18 completion of final act had become question of whether or not to accede to Soviet desire to include reference to irreversibility of dtenteTelegram 5501 from Geneva July 14 reads in part: The Soviets wish paragraph 1 of the Final Act to refer to the irreversibility of dtente a concept which Western participants have succeeded after difficult negotiations to remove from the language of the principles and their preamble National Archives RG 59 Central Foreign Policy Files As Soviet pressure increased resistance of NATO and neutral participants to inclusion of concept stiffened By the late evening of July 18 the question revolved around finding a suitable compromise which would allow the Soviets to back off without losing face Problem remained critical because Soviets tied approval of Europe clause covering Berlin to satisfaction of their desires on irreversibility Shortly after midnight on July 19 Soviet delegation chief Kovalev apparently telephoned Moscow for agreement to fall back When instructions were received the Soviets proposed substitution of the formulation make continuing and lasting for irreversible Other participants agreed immediately and negotiation of final act was completed Package of statements and documents accompanying final act also includes letter which Government of Finland will transmit to UN Secretary General notifying him that the final act is not eligible in whole or in part for registration with the Secretariat under article 102 of the Charter of the United Nations as would be in the case were it a matter of a treaty or international agreement  This statement combined with a reference to nonregisterability and a socalled disclaimer paragraph in the final act itself provide sound legal backing for the position that CSCE commitments are not legally binding A further element in final act package is entry into official journal of statement by executive secretary of conference calling for participants to notify Secretariat of exact titles they wish to have inscribed under signature of their representative This procedure was arranged to establish the principle that each participant may supply any title or titles he wishes to have placed under his name The arrangement was worked out between the USSR and EC participants as a means of providing for inscription of EC presidency title under the name of Italian Prime Minister Moro By making submission of titles a general principle the EC relieved the Soviets of the need to give approval to inclusion of Moros EC function Since the Secretariat statement was entered into the journal with a comment that the coordinating committee had taken note of the request the EC has a certain guarantee that the procedure will be honored4 Principles and their implementationduring intensive informal sessions principles subcommittee gradually narrowed the outstanding questions down to a series of interrelated issues the key to which was the manner in which the duty to refrain from the threat or use of force was to be qualified an issue on which Cypriots and Turks were bitterly divided Breakthrough became possible when Turkish del received flexible instructions allowing him to accept a compromise package from the chair with only minor changes After this decision principles declaration quickly fell into line and final stylistic review was completed Subcommittee registered the text on July 19 and committee I registered it on July 20 as a number of delegations filed interpretive statements on various issues Following RomanianSoviet agreement on voluntary basis issue in CBMs special working body on implementation sent texts of Romanian and Swiss proposals to committee I which registered texts on July 205 Military securityin order to appease Turks and overcome last major stumbling block on area of application of maneuver CBM Soviets and Warsaw Pact allies early in week reluctantly accepted lastminute addition of sentence to effect that notification of combined maneuvers should be considered even below threshold of 25000 troops if there were significant numbers of amphibious or airborne troops involved Neutrals expressed gratification with this step which enabled them to abandon idea of a separate threshold for independent amphibious and airborne maneuvers and with US agreement to clarification of threshold so that there is no misunderstanding that all maneuvers in Europe involving over 25000 troops are to be notified whether the troops are land forces airborne or amphibious or combinations thereof Concurrently Soviets Romanians and Dutch reached agreement on compromise text for preamble expressing voluntary basis for prior notification of maneuvers Despite these moves by others Turkish delegation held fast until final hours of Stage II on its original area text and real negotiations on a substitute began only on July 18 Substitute text was introduced by Turkish delegation which accepted principle of equal application of CBM measure in USSR and Turkey and thus met requirements of most participants but exception for areas close to Iran Iraq and Syria was initially expressed in a manner unacceptable to Cyprus After marathon mediation by allies with assistance from Soviets and others an awkward text mutually acceptable to Turkey and Cyprus was agreed in the early morning of July 19 enabling conference to confirm consensus on July 30 summit date Subcommittee completed work on smaller remaining points and inserted numerical parameters on July 19 and registered text on July 206 Economicslast remaining issue in Basket II was resolved when Soviets accepted a phrase linking reciprocity and MFN7 Humanitarian cooperationquestions of title for Basket III document and link phrase between overall preamble and substantive texts were settled and full document was registered by coordinating committee8 MediterraneanMaltese compromise phrase making reduction of armed forces in the Mediterranean region one of the purposes of continued contacts on the Mediterranean was accepted and Mediterranean Declaration agreed9 Followupsite for 1977 followup meetings was not agreed until final hours of the conference Belgrade and Helsinki were both offered as possibilities but Yugoslavs refused on principle to compromise by splitting the meetings between the two capitals and insisted that both should take place in the same location Yugoslavs and Romanians felt strongly that a further meeting in Helsinki would undercut the concept of rotation and could be the beginning of a permanent site Since Finns have hosted preparatory talks and Stages I and III and since Yugoslav candidacy for hosting followup meetings had been presented first pressure built for Finns to withdraw which they did in early morning hours of July 21 Coordinating committee immediately agreed that both 1977 followup meetings should take place in Belgrade10 Comment: This is the last highlights cable which USDelCSCE will send We hope these cables have served to keep addressees informed of the development of the Geneva negotiations and that they have been useful to those who have followed CSCE from a distanceDale	19750721

BY THE SECRETARY                            IN HIS PARIS AND OECD SPEECHES WHERE SOME OF OUR APPROACHES WERE                            OUTLINED THIS SPEECH WAS DESIGNED TO BE A SCENESETTER NOT A VEHICLE                            FOR NEW INITIATIVES IT IS BECAUSE WE TAKE THIS BASIC CONSTRUCTIVE APPROACH THAT WE FEEL IT                            IS NECESSARY TO SPEAK FRANKLY ABOUT PROBLEMS WHICH HAVE DEVELOPED IN                            RECENT YEARS AND WHICH AS SECRETARYS SPEECH POINTS OUT COULD THREATEN                            THE FUTURE CAPABILITY OF THE UNITED NATIONS AND OUR POSSIBILITY OF                            COOPERATING WITHIN IT A TO EXCLUDE COUNTRIES FROM PARTICIPATION IN UN ACTIVITIES BY MEANS                            OTHER THAN THOSE PROVIDED IN ARTICLES 5

DISLIKED COULD THREATEN                            THE INTEGRITY AND SURVIVAL OF THE BODY WHICH EXCLUDES THEM ARBITRARY                            IMPOSITION OF SUCH A DECISION OVER THE OPPOSITION OF MEMBER STATES WHICH                            PROVIDE VITAL SUPPORT TO THE ORGANIZATION COULD JEOPARDIZE THE                            CONTINUING VIABILITY OF THE UN FURTHERMORE IF THE UN IS TO DO SERIOUS                            BUSINESS AND TO COME TO GRIPS REALISTICALLY WITH IMPORTANT PROBLEMS IT                            WOULD BE ILLOGICAL TO EXCLUDE FROM PARTICIPATION COUNTRIES WHOSE

TO COPE WITH ITS FUNDAMENTAL ECONOMIC TECHNICAL                            AND SOCIAL TASKS AND US PUBLIC OPINION WOULD SEE NO PURPOSE IN                            SUPPORTING SUCH AN AGENCY C IF WE

REASONABLE TO ASK THAT OUR OWN SERIOUS AND NEW                            EFFORT TOWARDS COOPERATION BE RECIPROCATED THE WORLD COMMUNITY CANNOT                            MAKE PROGRESS ON ITSMOST

          SELECTED NATIONS WERE CITED FOR VIOLATIONS OF HUMAN AND TRADE UNIONS                            RIGHTS WAS OBSCENE AND IF DOUBLE STANDARD PERSISTED US COULD END UP

SUPPORT FROM ILO WERE BOTH GRAVE MEASURES WHICH                            WOULD NOT ONLY CAUSE FINANCIAL HARM BUT COULD RESULT IN SERIOUS CHANGE                            IN NATURE AND OPERATION OF ILO HOWEVER OF THE TWO ALTERNATIVES                            WITHDRAWAL OF US FINANCIAL SUPPORT WOULD CAUSE IMMEDIATE AND MORE                            GRIEVOUS HARM BY FORCING CUTBACK IN PRESENT

ARE HOWEVER FORCED TO CHOOSE BETWEEN TWO PRINCIPLESON THE                            ONE HAND THE ADHERENCE BY PARTICULAR COUNTRIES TO UNITED NATIONS                            PRINCIPLES ON THE OTHER HAND THE PRINCIPLE OF THE UNIVERSALITY OF                            MEMBERSHIP OF THE UNITED NATIONS ITSELF THE TWO PRINCIPLES CONFLICT IN                            THIS CASE AND OF THE TWO THE UNITED STATES CONSIDERS THE PRINCIPLE OF                            UNIVERSALITY TO BE THE MORE IMPORTANT ACCORDINGLY WE HAVE DECIDED TO                            ABSTAIN ON THE RESOLUTION AND SO PERMIT THE ENTRY OF THESE TWO                            NATIONS3 ON THE SAME OCCASION THE UNITED STATES SHOULD REITERATE OUR                            WHOLEHEARTED SUPPORT FOR THE ADMISSION OF SOUTH KOREA EITHER ALONE OR                            WITH NORTH KOREA WE COULD ALSO DEMAND OF OUR FELLOW COUNCIL MEMBERS                            THAT AS A MATTER OF PRINCIPLE AND OF PRACTICALITY THAT THEY ENABLE SOUTH                            KOREA TO BE ADMITTED AS WELL WHETHER WE SHOULD TABLE A RESOLUTION THEN                            AND THERE IS A MATTER WE CAN DECIDE LATER AS WASHINGTON KNOWS THERE IS                            PROBABLY NOT NOW A SUFFICIENT NUMBER OF VOTES AVAILABLE EVEN TO GET THE                            SOUTH KOREAN APPLICATION INSCRIBED ON THE COUNCIL AGENDA4 AT THE SAME TIME THE UNITED STATES REPRESENTATIVE SHOULD MAKE AN                            EXHAUSTIVE AND UNYIELDING STATEMENT IN DEFENSE OF THE RULE THAT FOLLOWS                            FROM THE PRINCIPLE OF UNIVERSALITY WHICH IS THAT NATIONS ONCE ADMITTED                            ARE NOT TO BE ARBITRARILY AND ILLEGALLY EXPELLED FROM THE GENERAL                            ASSEMBLY AND SUCH LIKE ORGANS IN BOTH CASES WE ADDRESS OURSELVES TO A                            CONSTITUTIONAL QUESTION AS THE SECRETARY STATED IN MILWAUKEE WE WILL                            HAVE THE OCCASION TO REMIND THE WORLD THAT THE UNITED NATIONS IS A                            SYSTEM BASED ON THE PRINCIPLE OF REPRESENTATION THIS IS A WESTERN                            PRINCIPLE NO DOUBT MOST MEMBERS OF THE UNITED NATIONS DO NOT                            THEMSELVES HAVE REPRESENTATIVE GOVERNMENTS BUT IF THEY WANT A UNITED                            NATIONS THEY WILL SIMPLY HAVE TO ACCEPT THAT PRINCIPLE IN THE WORLD                            BODY IF THEY DO NOT THEN IT IS THEY WHO MUST BE SEEN TO BLAME5 WE WILL NOT GET SOUTH KOREA INTO THE UNITED NATIONS UNLESS THE NORTH                            CHANGES ITS VIEW BUT THIS AMERICAN REPRESENTATIVE WILL DEMAND DAILY TO                            KNOW WHY WE HAVE NOT WHY THE COMMUNIST POWERS ONLY WANT OTHER COMMUNIST                            POWERS AS MEMBERS FOR THE FIRST TIME IN A LONG WHILE THE INITIATIVE                            WILL BE WITH US AND UNMISTAKABLY BEST ARGUMENT WILL BE WITH US WE WILL                            MAKE CLEAR THAT AT THE VERY MINIMUM HAVING DENIED KOREA MEMBERSHIP THE                            GENERAL ASSEMBLY MUST PROVIDE IT THE SECURITY OF AN ORDERLY TRANSFER OF                            COMMAND: KOREA OF ALL PLACES IS THE ONE NATION THAT MUST BE THE                            SPECIAL OBJECT OF THE GENERAL ASSEMBLYS CONCERN6 WE WILL HAMMER AT THIS THEME THROUGHOUT THE ASSEMBLY THE UNITED                            NATIONS NEEDS SEOUL DAY AFTER DAY THE UNITED NATIONS COMMUNITY WILL BE                            BROUGHT TO SEE THE RELATION OF THIS TO THE QUESTION OF ISRAELI                            MEMBERSHIP THE NONALIGNED WILL END UP WISHING THEY HAD NEVER HEARD OF                            VIETNAM A SENTIMENT WHICH WOULD THEN INDEED APPROACH UNIVERSALITY7 THE ALTERNATIVE SCENARIO OF COURSE FOLLOWS FROM A VETO I MUST                            REPORT THAT IT IS THE UNANIMOUS AND FIRM CONVICTION OF THE POLITICAL AND                            LEGAL OFFICERS OF THIS MISSION AND IT IS MY OPINION THAT FOR US TO                            VETO THE ADMISSION OF THE VIETNAMS WOULD BE A CALAMITY WE WOULD BE SEEN                            TO ACT OUT OF BITTERNESS BLINDNESS WEAKNESS AND FEAR WE WOULD BE SEEN                            NOT ONLY TO HAVE LOST THE HABIT OF VICTORY BUT IN THE PROCESS TO HAVE                            ACQUIRED THE MOST PITEOUS STIGMATA OF DEFEAT BUT THERE WOULD BE LITTLE                            PITY THE OVERWHELMING RESPONSE WOULD BE CONTEMPT NOT LEAST FROM OUR                            ALLIES8 THIS SATISFACTION SAVORED THE NEXT STEP OF ASSORTED ENEMIES AND                            ADVERSARIES WOULD BE TO MOVE DIRECTLY TO EXPLOIT THE OPPORTUNITY                            PRESENTED BY THE AMERICAN VETO OF THE PRINCIPLE OF UNIVERSALITY THE                            FIRST VETO BY US OF A MEMBERSHIP APPLICATION AND ONE PRESUMABLY BASED                            ON THE PRINCIPLE OF LINKAGE WHICH THE INTERNATIONAL COURT OF JUSTICE HAS                            ADVISED IS ILLEGAL SOUTH AFRICA WOULD BE EXPELLED FROM THE GENERAL                            ASSEMBLY CHILE PERHAPS THEN ISRAEL IT IS THE OPINION OF THE                            PROFESSIONAL OFFICERS OF THIS MISSION THAT THE NEGATIVE ATTITUDES WHICH                            A VIETNAM VETO WOULD AROUSE COULD MAKE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN VICTORY                            AND DEFEAT ON THE QUESTION OF ISRAELI EXPULSION FROM THE GENERAL                            ASSEMBLY IF ISRAEL IS EXPELLED THE WORLD WILL BE ASSURED THAT THIS                            CAME ABOUT BECAUSE OF AMERICAN BLUNDERS WHICH UNDERMINED EVERY PRINCIPLE                            ON WHICH THE ARAB DEMAND MIGHT HAVE BEEN RESISTED THIS VIEW WILL                            INEVITABLY BE SHARED BY MANY IN THE UNITED STATES9 AFTER THE EXPULSION OF ISRAEL FROM THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY THAT BODY                            INDIFFERENT TO ANY APPEAL WE MIGHT MAKE OR ANY THAT MIGHT BE MADE ON OUR                            BEHALF WILL PROCEED TO DEMAND THE EXPULSION OF AMERICAN FORCES FROM                            SOUTH KOREA FOR A QUARTER CENTURY OUR FORCES HAVE SEEN THERE AT THE                            BEHEST OF WORLD OPINION AS CONSTITUTED IN THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY THEY                            WILL THEREAFTER BE THERE IN DEFIANCE OF IT HOWEVER LEGALLY IN THE BEST                            OF COMING CIRCUMSTANCES IT WILL BE HARD INDEED TO GAIN A MAJORITY FOR                            OUR RESOLUTION CALLING FOR THE UNITED STATES AND THE REPUBLIC OF KOREA                            TO BECOME SUCCESSORS IN COMMAND THERE BUT IN THE PROFESSIONAL OPINION                            OF THE MISSION OFFICERS CONCERNED OUR CHANCES WOULD FALL DRAMATICALLY                            IN THE AFTERMATH OF A VIETNAM VETO SOUTH KOREA WILL BE INCREASINGLY                            ISOLATED OUR SUPPORT WILL INCREASINGLY BE DISPUTED WITHIN THE UNITED                            STATES ITSELF THE QUESTION OF WAR OR THE ABANDONMENT OF AN ALLY BECOMES                            A QUESTION OF WHEN THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH WILL KNOW THIS AS FOR EXAMPLE                            IT KNEW ON THE EVE OF WORLD WAR TWO BUT CONGRESSIONAL AND PUBLIC                            OPINION WILL BE UTTERLY INACCESSIBLE TO ALL WARNINGS10 WHAT WOULD COME WITH WAR OR ABANDONMENT WE CAN HARDLY SAY BUT THE                            EXPULSION OF ISRAEL WILL BE DISASTER ENOUGH THE UNITED STATES SENATE                            HAS ALREADY RESOLVED THAT

       LINKAGE TO A RENEWED ROK APPLICATION BUT                            TO AVOID ARGUING THE VIETNAMS QUALIFICATIONS AND USE THIS POSITION TO                            URGE THE VIETNAMS NOT TO

USSR AND CHINA WILL DEFER TO NORTH KOREA AND OPPOSE ENTRY                            OF ROK AT MINIMUM WE WANT TO BRING ABOUT SITUATION IN WHICH VIETNAM                            APPLICATIONS ARE NOT PRESSED TO VOTE2 ASSISTANT SECRETARY BUFFUM IS                            INFORMING ROK AMBASSADOR JULY 28 OF ABOVE AND OF DESIRABILITY OF ROK                            RENEWING ITS APPLICATION AT ONCE WE DO NOT BELIEVE ROK SHOULD PRESS FOR                                SC CONSIDERATION HOWEVER UNLESS SC                            WERE TO BE CONVENED TO CONSIDER VIETNAMESE APPLICATIONS3 WE ALSO INTEND TO CONVEY TO SOVIETS IN NEW YORK OUR VIEW THAT                            APPLICATION OF TWO VIETNAMS SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED APART FROM THAT OF                            ROK AND THAT NOW IS TIME TO FINALLY RESOLVE MATTER OF DIVIDED COUNTRIES                            BY ADMISSION OF VIETNAMS ROK AND IF IT WISHES THE DPRK QUESTION OF APPROACHES TO PRC WILL BE ADDRESSED SEPARATELY AND WE DO                            NOT INTEND TO APPROACH EITHER OF THE VIETNAMS ON THIS ISSUE IN THE NEAR                            TERM LEAVING TO USSR COMMUNICATION OF OUR VIEWS TO VIETNAM4 WE ALSO RECOGNIZE THAT IT NECESSARY NOT ONLY THAT USSR AND PRC NOT                            OPPOSE KOREAN MEMBERSHIP IN SECURITY COUNCIL BUT THAT THEY AGREE NOT TO                            LOBBY TO BLOCK ROK APPLICATION OUR PRESENT READING IS THAT WE HAVE ONLY                            7 CERTAIN VOTES ON SECURITY COUNCIL AND WOULD HAVE TO ATTRACT TWO MORE                            EVEN WITHOUT SOVIET AND CHINESE VETOES5 WHEN AND IF SECRETARY APPROVES OF THIS COURSE USUN SHOULD ARRANGE TO                            CONTACT SMUN AT DEP PERM REP LEVEL AND CONVEY US VIEWS ON VIETNAMESE AND                            KOREAN APPLICATIONS AS OUTLINED IN THE FOLLOWING PARAGRAPHS6 SMUN DEP REP SHOULD BE REMINDED THAT EARLIER THIS YEAR SOVIET EMBASSY                            IN WASHINGTON AT THE REQUEST OF HANOI ASKED IF THE USG WOULD SUPPORT THE ADMISSION OF NORTH                            AND SOUTH VIETNAM INTO THE UN WE ASKED THEN IF THE SOVIET GOVERNMENT                            WOULD BE WILLING TO FACILITATE SOUTH KOREAS APPLICATION JUST AS WE                            WOULD CONCUR IN NORTH KOREAS APPLICATION WERE THEY TO APPLY USG HAS                            GIVEN FURTHER CAREFUL STUDY SINCE THEN TO THE QUESTION OF MEMBERSHIP IN                            THE UN FOR THE TWO VIETNAMS AND BELIEVES THAT AT THE PRESENT TIME IT                            WOULD NOT BE IN THE INTERESTS OF THE ORGANIZATION TO CONSIDER THESE                            APPLICATIONS UNTIL THE QUESTION OF UN MEMBERSHIP FOR ALL PRESENTLY                            DIVIDED STATES CAN BE RESOLVED7 FAILURE TO STRIVE FOR AND MAINTAIN FULL PARTICIPATION IN THE UN NOT                            HELPFUL TO ACHIEVING THE REDUCTION OF TENSIONS IN WHICH BOTH US AND USSR                            ARE INTERESTED8 THE COMBINATION OF THE VIETNAMS RECENT APPLICATION AND SOUTH KOREAS                            LONGSTANDING APPLICATION GIVES THE UN THE OPPORTUNITY TO BRING A DEGREE                            OF NORMALITY AND STABILITY TO BOTH OF THESE AREAS THE SCENE OF MUCH                            DISRUPTIVE INTERNATIONAL TENSION WE BELIEVE THE ADMISSION OF ALL OF                            THESE APPLICANTS WOULD CONTRIBUTE TO THE REDUCTION OF INTERNATIONAL                            TENSIONS AND TOGETHER WITH THE ANTICIPATED ADMISSION OF MOZAMBIQUE                            ANGOLA AND OTHERS VIRTUALLY COMPLETE THE PROCESS OF UNIVERSAL                            ASSOCIATION WITH THE UN BOTH OUR COUNTRIES SHARE AN INTEREST IN                            REDUCTIONS OF TENSION AND FULL PARTICIPATION OF STATES IN THE UN AND WE                            HOPE THE SOVIET GOVERNMENT WOULD FACILITATE ALL OF THESE                            APPLICATIONS9 YOU SHOULD ALSO POINT OUT THAT THE INCREASINGLY SKEPTICAL PUBLIC                            OPINION IN THIS COUNTRY TOWARD THE UN COULD BE NEGATIVELY AFFECTED BY                            THE SPECTACLE OF THE ADMISSION OF TWO VIETNAMS WHILE SOUTH KOREA IS                            EXCLUDED FURTHERMORE CRITICS OF DETENTE WOULD FIND A FURTHER RATIONALE                            FOR ARGUING THAT IT WAS A ONE WAY STREET ESPECIALLY IF IT BECAME CLEAR                            THAT THE SOVIET POSITION WAS INSTRUMENTAL IN CAUSING THE SECURITY                            COUNCIL TO FAIL TO CONSIDER AND ENDORSE SOUTH KOREAN MEMBERSHIP SOVIETS                            SHOULD UNDERSTAND PARTICULARLY WELL THE ADVERSE PUBLIC REACTION WHICH                            WOULD BE GENERATED IN THE US BY SUCH DISCRIMINATION AGAINST SOUTH                            KOREA10 ADMISSION OF BOTH VIETNAMS IN THE FACE OF CONTINUED EXCLUSION OF THE                            REPUBLIC OF KOREA WOULD IN FACT CREATE SUCH ADDED DIFFICULTIES FOR THE                            CONTINUED SUPPORT OF THE UN IN THE US AND HAVE SUCH A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON                            THE PROSPECTS FOR FUTURE STABILITY ON THE KOREAN PENINSULA THAT WE WOULD                            BE PREPARED TO USE OUR VETO TO KEEP IT FROM HAPPENING WE MUCH PREFER                            ENTRY OF ALL DIVIDED COUNTRIES WITHOUT PREJUDICE TO FUTURE UNIFICATION                            WE BELIEVE NOW IS THE TIME TO ACT11 WHILE THE SOUTH KOREANS ARE RENEWING THEIR APPLICATION FOR ADMISSION                            TO THE UN WE DO NOT BELIEVE THAT THEY WOULD PRESS SC CONSIDERATION                            UNLESS SC WERE TO BE CONVENED TO CONSIDER VIETNAMESE APPLICATIONS                            THEREFORE IF THE SOVIETS ARE UNWILLING AT THIS TIME TO SUPPORT SOUTH                            KOREAS APPLICATION WE BELIEVE THAT BEST SOLUTION WOULD BE FOR TWO                            VIETNAMS TO LEAVE THEIR APPLICATIONS STANDING BUT NOT PRESS FOR EARLY                            CONSIDERATION MEANTIME WE WOULD EXPECT TO CONTINUE CONSULTATION WITH                            USSR AND OTHER PERMANENT SC MEMBERS WITH A VIEW TO REACHING AGREEMENT ON                            SOLUTION WHICH WILL BRING ALL DIVIDED STATES WHO WISH MEMBERSHIP INTO                            UN12 SMUN WILL BE AWARE THAT WE HAVE ISSUED VISAS TO PRG AND NVN OBSERVERS AND HAVE NOT POSED                            ANY OBJECTION TO THEIR ENTRY OR PARTICIPATION AS OBSERVERS IN THE WORK                            OF THE UN WE BELIEVE THAT FOR THESE GOVERNMENTS AS WAS THE CASE FOR                            THE TWO GERMAN STATES THE PRESENCE IN NEW YORK OF THEIR REPRESENTATIVES                            ON THE SAME BASIS AS THAT OF THE TWO KOREAN STATES CAN BE A USEFUL                            PRELUDE TO THE INCLUSION OF ALL FOUR STATES13 YOU SHOULD ADD THAT WE WOULD REQUEST THAT THE SOVIETS SINCE THEY                            APPROACHED US INITIALLY ON BEHALF OF THE VIETNAMESE MAKE OUR CONSIDERED                            VIEWS KNOWN IN FULL TO THE TWO VIETNAMESE GOVERNMENTS ADDING THAT OUR                            POSITION IS ONE OF SEEKING TO BRING ADMISSION OF DIVIDED STATES ABOUT IN                            A CONTEXT CONDUCIVE TO THE MAINTENANCE OF INTERNATIONAL PEACE                            ESPECIALLY IN EASTERN ASIA AND HELPFUL TO THE GOAL OF UNIVERSAL UN                            MEMBERSHIP WE HOPE THAT WE WOULD THEREFORE NOT BE PLACED IN                            CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE WE SHOULD HAVE TO VOTE NEGATIVELY14 USUN IN CONVEYING FOREGOING FULLY SHOULD REPORT ANY REACTIONS OR                            COMMENTS IN THE UNLIKELY EVENT THAT THE SOVIETS SHOULD CITE THE 1948                                ICJ ADVISORY OPINION YOU MAY                            COMMENT THAT NEITHER THE USSR NOR THE SECURITY COUNCIL HAVE EXPRESSED                            SUPPORT FOR THIS OPINION AND THAT RELUCTANT AS WE ARE TO DEVIATE FROM                            IT WE REGARD THE CONSIDERATIONS PRESENTED AS MORE COMPELLING AT THIS                            MOMENT15 FOR SECRETARY USUN WILL EXECUTE FOREGOING AS SOON AS YOA APPROVE WE                            BELIEVE IT DESIRABLE THAT FOREGOING MESSAGE GET TO VIETNAMESE BEFORE                            THEIR OBSERVERS SEEK TO SET DATE OF SC MEETING ON THEIR APPLICATIONS                            SINCE WE WOULD HAVE LITTLE SUPPORT IN SC FOR DELAYING MEETING RECOMMEND                            THAT YOU TAKE OPPORTUNITY IN TALKS WITH GROMYKO TO REFER TO OUR APPROACH TO SMUN SO THAT HE WILL                            BE AWARE OF IMPORTANCE YOU ATTACH TO MATTER WE INTEND TO BRIEF UK FRENCH JAPANESE AND ITALIAN MISSIONS IN                            CONFIDENCE ON OUR TALK WITH SOVIETS AND ALSO RECOMMEND TELLING PRC UN                            MISSION ALTHOUGH WE COULD WAIT UNTIL YOUR MEETING WITH THEM SHOULD YOU
