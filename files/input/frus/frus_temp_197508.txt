Defense Representative to Tehran For the Secretary from                            Ingersoll Maw and Eagleburger1 Summary You will recall discussion here two weeks                        ago with Dick Helms on DOD proposal to establish new top management                        position in Tehran to be called US Defense representative Iran DefRepIranHelms was in                            Washington July 1519 to testify before the Senate Select Committee to                            Study Governmental Operations with Respect to Intelligence Activities                            known as the Church Committee after its chairman Senator Frank Church                            The committee was investigating covert assassination attempts against                            foreign leaders and domestic spying conducted by the Central                            Intelligence Agency under Helmss tenure as Director of Central Intelligence The                            discussion of Iran has not been found Your initial reaction to                        this proposal was negativeKissinger initially opposed the                            proposal for a civilian Defense representative in

                  a long discussion with senior Pentagon officials and with Departments                        Deputy Inspector General for Foreign Assistance we believe the case merits                        your reconsiderationIn telegram Tosec 80306183065 August 2 Eagleburger explained to Kissinger that there was a major                            scandal brewing among US Defense representatives military                            contractors and the Iranian Government: Management of our FMS program and other military sales                            programs in Iran is at best a mess At worst there are major                            illegalities He assured Kissinger that the Department of State could reach                            agreeable terms of reference for the position with Defense                            Ibid We are persuaded that mushrooming Defense programs in Iran are not under                        control and have potential for becoming major Congressional and foreign                        policy headache and that Helms                        needs top management assistance to avoid this Approval of DOD proposal would put us in position to say                        to Congress that Executive branch had recognized problem and was already                        taking steps on its own to deal with it We believe Shah would welcome this                        move but we would of course have Helms discuss it with him before moving ahead We will want                        to discuss this with you as will Schlesinger when you return Purpose of this message is to                        give you a chance to reflect on proposal in advance End                            summary2 At DOD request General Counsel Marty                        Hoffman and DSAA Chief General Fish met at Department July 30 with the                        Acting Secretary and several other Department officers including Maw Eagleburger Atherton Vest                            Leigh and Constandy Deputy IG of Foreign Assistance They laid out in greater detail than                        we had heard before the problems of managing the DOD operation in Iran and the reasons why they want to assign a                        super manager to Tehran The principal problems are A the tremendous                        expansion of FMS programs in Iran now                        totalling over 9 billion in orders with over 7 billion on delivery B                        proliferation of DOD units in Iran now                        including about 25 operational entities eg Gendarmerie Advisory Mission                        various intelligence detachments Armed Forces RadioTelevision Defense                        Mapping Agency USAF Weather Wing etc                        which do not fall under command of the major unit ARMISHMAAG C division of ARMISHMAAG itself along service lines with                        resulting difficulties of competition and gaps in coordination D                        increased need to monitor activities of private US defense suppliers who                        are crowding in on Tehran in search of contracts E emerging evidence that                        some major US defense suppliers have paid unapproved agent feesThe Iranian Government had prohibited the use of                            agents appointed by military contractors to secure government contracts                            in exchange for fees thereby raising the cost of arms purchases The                            rules were clarified in telegram 4807 from Tehran May 21 National                            Archives RG 59 Central Foreign Policy                            Files D7501800923 F increasing Congressional concern over                        the expansion of our arms sales to Iran with prospects of further efforts                        at Congressional oversight3 Constandy recently headed a small                        informal security assistance inspection team to Iran He came up with                        indications of slack management and possible outright irregularities                        pointing to current need for fullfledged formal inspection We have agreed                        that such inspection should be undertaken without delay and will be getting                        in touch with Helms as a first step                        Meanwhile Constandy has                        independently come to conclusion that there needs to be tighter top DOD management in Tehran along lines of                        current DOD proposal4 Although theoretically the senior DOD rep                        now in Iran Chief of ARMISHMAAG could                        be given such greater responsibilities as Pentagon now proposes for new                            DefRepIran Pentagon maintains                        that twostar rank is not enough One possibility would be to go to Congress                        for authorization to assign a threestar General Pentagon argues that it is                        strongly preferable in current situation to assign a senior civilian as                            DefRepIran to insure stronger                        civilian control and overcome interservice rivalries Individual the                        Pentagon has in mind is Eric Von                            Marbod current Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary of                        Defense Controller As you may recall he played effective coordinating                        role in our security assistance program to Vietnam Several of us in                        Department are acquainted with Von                            Marbod and have very high regard for him Assuming DefRepIran is assigned proposal is                        that Chief of ARMISHMAAG a USAF Major General will be designated as his                        deputy Current Chief of ARMISHMAAG is                        scheduled to depart in near future and his replacement would arrive to take                        his place under the new management system if DefRepIran position is established soon Von Marbod has worked well in past in                        Country Team situations5 Terms of Reference DefRepIran                        would be member of the Country Team under the direction of and reporting                        to the Ambassador His principal mission would be to supervise and                        coordinate all DOD activities in Iran                        excluding Defense Attach and Marine guards which remain under direct                        Embassy supervision He would be responsible for formulating coordinating                        and presenting DOD positions in Iran within                        framework of overall USG policy and                        monitoring security assistance activities He would report to Sec Def                        through CINCEUR CJCS and ISADSAA in accordance with                        established guidelines under overall local direction of the Ambassador and                        keeping the Ambassador fully informed of all aspects of his work DefRepIran would be authorized an                        additional staff of up to eight military and civilian personnel but major                        staff and legal support would be provided by ARMISHMAAG6 We are acutely sensitive to risks of creating new twoheaded civilian                        plus military monster over our Defense activities in Iran Dick Helms expressed concern that                        establishment of new top Defense position could tend to undermine his own                        position as the Presidents representative and the single US official in                        charge of all our activities in IranHelms expressed this concern to                                Scowcroft in backchannel

Pentagon knows of this concern and has taken pains to                        emphasize that DefRepIran would be                        member of the Ambassadors team and serve under his policy guidance and                        supervision He would be provided                        with explicit written instructions on this point subject to States review                        and approval They maintain that having better toplevel Defense management                        will enable the Ambassador to carry out more effectively his own role as the                        senior US official in country They have also emphasized that Von Marbod has proved his ability to work                        effectively with our Ambassadors abroad Phil                            Habib is a strong supporter of Von Marbod from his work in Southeast Asia7 Schlesinger intends to call you                        after your return to solicit your support for the DefRepIran proposal We are told that                            DOD proposal also has support of                        General Brown8 If you agree we would plan to get in touch with Helms and ask his own reconsideration and                        agreement to the DefRepIran                        proposal based on the considerations outlined above If he agrees we will                        then wish him to check the idea

frus1969-76v27d294	294 Telegram From the Interests Section in Baghdad to the Department of State	None	1975-08-29 13:00:00	None	None	898 Subject: USIraqi Issues: I Palestine Ref: Baghdad 896Not found1 Summary: Perceptions of Palestine are at the heart                        of USIraqi differences No enduring improvement in our bilateral relations                        is possible if each side is not able to discern a nugget of merit and                        something to work with in the others position on Palestine Assuming that                        forthcoming USIraqi contacts at UNGA                        intend a qualitative escalation in USIraqi political relations USINT recommends that US side take                        initiative and boldly highlight those aspects of US position on Palestine                        which can be made to appear to have moral weight with Iraqis and which give                            GOI basis for further dealings with US                        In this regard tone style and emphasis can be as important as substance                        and an attitude of respect for and interest in probing Iraqs views on this                        matter can well lead to greater GOI                        receptivity to US initiatives on less divisive issues End                            summary2 In GOI view US support for Israels                        claims visvis Palestinians is total and unquestioning US efforts to                        lessen tensions between Israel and her nearest Arab neighbors are generally                        regarded as sophisticated effort to defang Palestinians by immersing major                        Arab nations in labyrinth of negotiations about peripheral issues in order                        to distract them from championing cause of Palestinians3 FonMinHammadi therefore is probably                        mentally preconditioned to expect to be told of US activities and                        initiatives in every area of mutual concern except Palestine He probably                        for example expects to receive congratulations for ending of Kurdish                        insurrection and for improved relations with Iran and the Gulf states He                        would not be surprised to hear review of recent US activities in Sinai                        negotiations and to learn of latest US position on oil and on                        consumerproducer dialogue But he probably envisages himself at the end of                        such a presentation being compelled to say: We welcome all this but why does                        the US keep dodging the central issue: how to reconcile equitably and                        peacefully the conflicting claims of Jews and Arabs to the right to exert                        political authority in Palestine4 A very good case can therefore be made for the US in the forthcoming                            talksAccording to telegrams 828 884 and                            894 from Baghdad August 2 23 and 29 Lowrie told Iraqi officials that Kissinger hoped to meet with Iraqi                            Foreign Minister Hammadi during                            the upcoming UN General Assembly                            session National Archives RG 59                            Central Foreign Policy Files D7502680578 D7502921108 and                            D7502990485 Their meeting did not occur until December 17 see Document 302 to take an unexpected tack                        and boldly to address the Palestinian problem at once attempting to see the                        issue through Iraqi eyes and acknowledging as an example the agonizing                        human problems faced by the exclusion of proud talented Palestinians from                        political power in their homeland It is hard to imagine any new substantive                        concessions to be made to the Iraqi viewpoint But tone and form of                        presentation and particularly emphasis what is said and what is left                        unsaid will at least be as important as substance Tone should A convey                        genuine human concern for Palestinians plus B communicate an                        acknowledgment that Iraqis are approaching problem from morally defensible                        or at least arguable albeit restricted point of view Form of presentation                        should select and highlight the most attractive from Palestinian and Iraqi                        point of view features of our policy on Israel and Palestine over the past                        30 years: eg refugee assistance support for UN resolutions Presentation should also explicitly express                        positive understanding for Palestinian aspirations and might usefully                        culminate in statement that US while not a principal party to the dispute                        would support any final political solution which is acceptable to both                        Israel and Palestinians and encourages at this juncture the consideration of                        any partial solutions which attempt peacefully to apply the rules of law and                        equity to the competing claims of all parties5 US might add that we have profited from advice of many Arab leaders on how                        to move in direction of general political settlement and would equally                        welcome constructive advice from Iraq as well with acknowledgment that Iraq                        is in unique position to influence Palestinian leaders6 How would Hammadi and the GOI react to such an approach Very                        positively The GOI by now has apparently                        come to believe its own rhetoric and is sincerely convinced that the US is                        out to toss the Palestinians upon the dustbin of history A tactical                        approach which begins from an effort to identify the merits of the Iraqi                        position and which skillfully and convincingly underlines our interest to                        the Iraqi spokesman in finding an overall solution which is fair to the                        Palestinians cannot fail to have a very strong impact on GOI Obvious as such a position may be in                        Washington it is not the US position as seen by Baghdad When reported by                            Hammadi to the RCC this ostensibly fresh approach may give                        the Baath Party pragmatists precisely the ideological underpinning they                        need in order to overcome the objections of the proSoviet wing to dealing with the US on the political                        level This reaction would be especially plausible if Hammadi had been made to believe that the                            USG would welcome an active role for                        Iraq in mediating between the US and the Palestinian leaders Aside from the                        wellknown Arab delight in such mediations cf Boumedienne with the Shah and                            Saddam Hussein Yamani with Syria and Iraq on the                        Euphrates waters etc Iraq would derive measurable satisfaction at being                        recognized as able to influence both the US and through the US Israel                        and the Palestinians It is difficult to imagine anything on the other                        hand less likely at this time to improve USIraqi relations than a                        deliberate US effort to exclude Iraq from such a position of influence in                        regard to a Palestinian settlement7 Conclusion: In dealing with Iraq there is no dodging the Palestinian                        issue On the other hand the US has obviously by now developed a position on                        Palestine which has been at least grudgingly or provisionally accepted by                        other leading Arab protagonists Controlling therefore from the very                        beginning the line of conversation on this issue with a maximum effort to                        go in through the Iraqi door in order to come out our own is probably the                        best way for the US to address the matter at this time If the GOI becomes convinced that there is enough                        justice to the US position and a workable element of openness to the                        aspirations of Iraqs Palestinian clients it is not inconceivable that                        subsequent progress in improving USIraqi political relations will be                        rapid and continuousKillough	19750829

Each group will choose its representatives to the                        conference within no more than a month after the preparatory meeting9 The Conference Between Industrialized Countries and Developing Countries                        will open at the Ministerial level Like the preparatory meeting it should                        last no more than two to three days10 The primary task of the conference will be to reach decisions on the                        proposals which shall be submitted by the preparatory meeting for                        approval11 This should lead to the creation of four commissions corresponding to the                        themes of the dialogue determination of how they should be composed and                        agreement on how to follow up the work of the commissions12 It would be advisable for these commissions to have no more than fifteen                        members In setting up the membership of each commission each of the two                        groups making up the conference will choose among its own members those who                        by virtue of their particular interests as well as the general significance                        to be attached to their participation seem best suited to be included so                        that the proceedings may take place in an efficient and responsible manner                        Each of the commissions will be presided over by two cochairmen designated                        respectively by each of the two groups13 The commissions will be made up of highlevel experts14 The commission on energy will have the task within the framework of a                        general survey of world prospects for production and consumption of energy                        including hydrocarbons of facilitating by appropriate ways and means                        arrangements which seem desirable between oil producers and consumers15 The commission on raw materials will have the task of facilitating by                        appropriate ways and means in the light of the existing situation                        arrangements which seem desirable in the area of raw materials including                        food commodities which are of particular interest to developing                        countries16 The commission on development will have the task of facilitating by                        appropriate ways and means in the light of the existing situation                        arrangements which seem desirable in the area of cooperation for                        development17 The commission for financial matters while respecting areas of                        competence of the international institutions IMF World Bank will study all financial problems related to                        the work of the three preceding commissions It will be made up of a limited                        number of members from each of these three commissions18 The commissions on raw materials and development will in particular                        consider the work being done in other appropriate international forums and                        will establish the necessary liaison with them19 Joint meetings of commission cochairmen may be provided for as                        required20 Observers from organizations directly concerned with the problems under                        consideration may sit with the commissions and have the right to speak21 The conference will meet again at the Ministerial level within about                        twelve months22 A meeting or meetings of the conference at the government official level                        could perhaps be held at least six months after the first meeting of the                        conference at the Ministerial level23 It would be desirable to reach a consensus on these various points within                        a fairly short time so that the convening of a new preparatory meeting may                        be announced as quickly as possibleAfter its                            informal August 25 meeting to address the French aidemmoire the                                IEA Governing Board issued a                            Secretariat note that explained that the delegations agreed as to the                            importance of resuming the dialogue promptly and were generally of the                            view that the procedures outlined in the aidemmoire for resuming the                            dialogue formed a basis on which participating countries of the Agency                            could accept invitations to participate in a new preparatory meeting                            subject to a list of items it wanted

frus1969-76v37d79	79 Telegram From the Embassy in Saudi Arabia to the Department of State	None	1975-08-28 13:30:00	None	None	6009 Subject: Oil PolicySummary: According to Oil Minister Yamani the Saudis had decided to hold the line for zero                        price increases in the September OPEC                        meeting They had even gone so far as to point out to Iranian Oil Minister                            Amouzegar that the Saudis might                        even risk destruction of OPEC to prevent a                        price increase In view of what the Saudis consider our new hard line                        toward them to be however price policy is now undergoing review and                            Yamani is not rpt not sure what position the Saudis will                        take Although the Ambassador stressed to Yamani that arguments he had previously made about price                        increases had not changed and said he knew of no signals of changed US                        policy toward the Saudis the outcome of the Saudis current policy review                        is in doubt Any letter from President Ford or other US leaders to King Khalid Prince Fahd or Yamani should call attention to the                        Saudis public statements on oil policy and express hope that Saudis will be                        able to hold that line at the OPEC                        meeting A tough letter on oil prices would almost certainly be                        counterproductive it might tend to confirm their fears that US policy                        toward Saudi Arabia had shifted End summary1 Saudi Oil Minister Yamani told me                        Aug 27 that my approaches to him from April through July on oil prices had                        been discussed at length in the Saudi Cabinet and had finally been accepted                        The Cabinet had agreed that at the OPEC                        meeting the end of September Saudi Arabia must hold the line against any                        price increase2 Prince Fahd discussed the matter with the Shah when he was there recently                        and with Amouzegar when the latter                        recently came to Saudi ArabiaFahd was in Iran                            July 13 and Amouzegar visited                            Saudi Arabia during the first week of August The Iranian                        position was that prices should rpt should                        be increased by the full 35 percent increase in cost of imports namely                        350 Iran however would be willing to compromise on a price increase                        of only 200 or 250 Yamani                        said Fahd unfortunately had been                        rather weak in dealing with the Shah Fahd had urged him to reconsider his                        position and to adopt a lower price but he made no threats and he gave no                        indication of independent Saudi action if Iran refused to move When                            Amouzegar was here however the                        Saudi position was much stronger Amouzegar was told Yamani said that if Iran insisted on a high price increase                        Saudi Arabia would sell at the lower price and increase its production                        markedly even if this risks a split in OPEC Yamani will be                        going to Tehran this afternoon Aug 28 or tomorrow to discuss the matter                        with the Iranians3 Yamani said it was absolutely                        crucial that the United States understand this Saudi action was a result of                        the approaches I had made and especially that the decision had been taken                        long before the new hard American line toward Saudi Arabia We should not                        deceive ourselves into thinking they had yielded to pressure There was                        ample evidence of this if we are willing to see it He had made a statement                        to the Cairo press three weeks ago which we surely had noted on the                        necessity of keeping oil prices frozen and Prince Fahd when in Paris had                        said that oil prices had risen far enough Note:                        There had been several SRF reports on the same line Yamani was also quoted in Ukaz on Aug 12 as saying the Kingdom saw no justified                        economic reason for raising petroleum prices and the interview published in                            Al Musawwar Aug 21 repeated this statement almost                        word for word4 Yamani said the situation had now                        changed Assistant Secretary Enders                        in London at the opening of the Prepcon                        launched US policy to break OPECNot further identified Prepcon I was held in Paris not                            London The Saudis chose to ignore this but our new policy                            Yamani said had clearly been                        formalized in my dismissalSee footnote 4 Document 52 and the                        adoption of a new hard line toward Saudi Arabia Yamani said he was not rpt not now sure what position Saudi Arabia                        would take on oil prices5 I told the Minister that this matter was infinitely more important than                        the person of the Ambassador that I had no idea what signals if any we                        were trying to send to the Saudis Yamani said he had long suspected that some in the US                        administration really wanted oil prices to go up A number of the Saudis                        friends in the OECD and the oil industry                        have told him that Assistant Secretary Enders has said that the US favored higher oil prices now                        as a means of uniting the consumers in economic or even military war against                        producers Yamani knew that I had                        taken quite another position that I had constantly fought cajoled persuaded the Saudis to keep the                        lid on oil prices and I had been successful in persuading them to do so He                        also had no doubt that this was the policy favored by the Secretary and                        Treasury and very likely by the President of the United States but others                        he said seem to be playing another game6 I told him that I did not know if anyone were playing a game at all My                        instructions had been clear but even if there were any taking such a                        devious position the Saudis should not rpt                        not play into their hands and agree to increased oil prices Yamani said he understood this point but                        we should also understand that many of the Saudi Cabinet now felt that with                        the new hard line toward Saudi Arabia the Saudi policy on oil prices must                        undergo a complete review7 Comment: Under the circumstances I strongly urge                        that any letter sent by President Ford to King Khalid or any letter from any US leader to the King the                        Crown Prince or the Petroleum Minister prior to the OPEC meeting call attention to the statements                        made by Prince Fahd in ParisOn July 22 Fahd                            told Giscard that if the industrialized countries stabilized currency                            rates the oil producers did not plan to raise prices later in the year                                The New York Times July 23 1975 p                            6 and by Yamani in                        Cairo that the letter express the hope that Saudi Arabia will be able to                        hold its publicly proclaimed line on prices in the OPEC meeting An expression of appreciation for the earlier                        actions of Saudi Arabia in restraining oil prices would also be well                        received here In no circumstances should Saudi Arabia be lumped together                        with those countries which have publicly demanded higher oil prices8 The Saudis are already disturbed at what they have interpreted as a change                        of American policy and they are beginning to worry again about the invasion                        threat If we send them a tough letter on oil pricesparticularly given the                        fact that they had accepted the arguments I had earlier made and confirmed                        this by public statementsthey will conclude that we are attempting to                        provoke them9 There can be no guarantee that the Saudis will not rpt not yield to OPEC pressures particularly in face of what they interpret as                        an American challenge but there seems no doubt that there is or has been                        a desire to hold the line on prices with no increase or at most an increase                        of 50 cents per barrel A word of appreciation and encouragement here would                        be much more effective than any                        threat or hard line we could and should take with other OPEC leadersReferring to this telegram and others Sober sent a personal message to Atherton in which he wrote: I believe                            we must assume that the SAG is                            genuinely concerned that we may be beginning a process of turning away                            from them Sober added that the                            Department should not ignore the possibility that the SAG actually intends to fight for keeping                            the present line on prices Most importantly he wrote I believe we                            need to get to the Saudis as quickly as possible and in a way that can                            best stem their current inclination to read strong negative political                            signals into our forthcoming change of Ambassadors Sober recommended a visit to Saudi                            Arabia by Kissinger so that the                            Royal family could hear the word directly concerning US intentions                            Finally Sober suggested                            modifying a previously proposed letter from President Ford to King Khalid on oil prices based on                            Akinss advice if we are to believe Yamani Telegram Tosec 100281205854 to

Prime Minister Buttigieg concentrated on Mediterranean aspects of CSCE and Maltese role in ensuring that Mediterranean interest in the conference was fully reflected Buttigieg apologized to all

THE EFFECT THAT AN INDIAN                            ATTACK ON PAKISTAN WITH SOVIET EQUIPMENT WOULD INVITE A RESPONSE FROM                            THE UNITED STATESIT IS AN ESTABLISHED FACT THAT

         THE PROCESS OF NORMALIZATION OF RELATIONS WITH INDIA IN ACCORDANCE WITH                            THE SIMLA AGREEMENT WE WILL SUSTAIN THIS POLICY AS LONG AS IT IS                            RECIPROCATED BY INDIA NEVERTHELESS OUR CONSIDERED ASSESSMENT OF THE                            SITUATION AS MR AHMED CONVEYED TO DR KISSINGER IS THAT WAR COULD COME AT                            ANY

PAKISTAN RECENTLY THE CHINESE                            GOVERNMENT ARE CONSIDERING THIS QUESTION BUT HAVE GIVEN US NO ANSWER SO                            FAR THEIR DECISION IN THIS REGARD CANNOT BUT BE INFLUENCED BY THE                            EXISTENCE OF THE INDOSOVIET TREATY THE CONSTRAINT ON CHINAS FREEDOM                            TO ACT AS A RESULT OF THIS TREATY WAS TRAGICALLY DEMONSTRATED WHEN INDIA                            ATTACKED PAKISTAN IN 1971 CHINA WAS HAMSTRUNG WHILE PAKISTAN WAS                            DISMEMBERED WITH SOVIET INSTIGATION AND SUPPORTDR KISSINGER THEN ENQUIRED                            WHETHER HE COULD ASK CHINA WHAT EXACTLY IT WOULD DO IF INDIA ATTACKED                            PAKISTAN AND ADDED THAT IF CHINA POSED THE COUNTERQUESTION AS TO WHAT                            THE UNITED STATES WOULD DO IN SUCH AN EVENT IT WOULD BE INFORMED THAT                            IF INDIA ATTACKED PAKISTAN AND CHINA CAME TO ITS

ARE SERIOUSLY CONCERNED OVER THE PROBABILITY OF INDIA DECIDING TO                            LAUNCH A WAR AGAINST PAKISTAN IN WHICH AFGAHNISTAN WILL ALSO JOIN AND                            BOTH WILL HAVE THE FULL BACKING OF THE SOVIET UNION SUCH A WAR COULD                            COME AT ANY TIME THE SOVIET UNION SHOULD JUDGE THE SITUATION TO BE RIPE                            IT IS OUR ASSESSMENT THAT IT COULD BE UNLEASHED WITHIN TWO YEARS BEFORE                            WE HAVE HAD THE TIME ADEQUATELY TO STRENGTHEN OUR DEFENCE CAPABILITY                            INDIA COULD

OF THE STATEAGAINST THIS BACKGROUND I WAS RELIEVED TO HEAR FROM MR AZIZ AHMED WHAT YOU HAD TOLD GROMYKO AND                            WHAT YOU PLANNED TO TELL THE CHINESE ABOUT THE ACTION THE UNITED STATES                            WOULD TAKE IF THE SOVIET UNION ATTACKED CHINA FOR COMING TO PAKISTANS                            ASSISTANCE IN THE EVENT OF AN INDIAN ATTACK ON PAKISTANTHIS LATTER ASSURANCE COULD HAVE A MOST VITAL BEARING ON THE BALANCE OF                            POWER IN ASIA AND FORTIFY PEACE AND STABILITY IN THIS CRITICAL REGION I                            CONSIDER IT TO BE THE MOST EFFECTIVE COUNTER YET TO THE SOVIET AMBITIONS                            TO EXTEND HEGEMONY TO PAKISTAN WHICH IS THE IMMEDIATE TARGET OF THESE                            AMBITIONS IT COMES AS A REFRESHING INDICATION OF A NEW DETERMINATION IN                            THE UNITED STATES ADMINISTRATION TO SAFEGUARD PEACE AND STABILITY IN                            SOUTH ASIAI SHOULD ALSO

OF TOMORROWMAY I SUGGEST THAT THE QUESTION OF CHINESE ASSISTANCE TO PAKISTAN IN THE                            EVENT OF AN INDIAN ATTACK MAY BE TAKEN UP WITH THE CHINESE LEADERS WHILE

AS FOREIGN AFFAIRS ARE CONCERNED                            BUSINESS WILL BE MUCH AS USUAL THERE IS ALREADY SOME EVIDENCE THAT THE                            NEW GOVERNMENT WILL WANT TO STRENGTHEN ITS TIES WITH THE MUSLIM WORLD                            INCLUDING PAKISTAN AT THE SAME TIME MUSHTAQUES WELLKNOWN ANTIPATHY TO INDIA                            NOTWITHSTANDING THE NEW REGIME WILL NOT

                 ANTIAMERICAN VIEWS SHEIKH MONI AND SAMAD                            EXAMPLE ARE NOW GONE THE POSSIBILITY IS ALSO STRONG THAT THEY WILL                            LOOK TO US FOR EVEN LARGER AMOUNTS OF AID MUSHTAQUE HAS ARGUED WITH US BEFORE THAT WE ARE THE ONLY                            ONES WHO CAN TRULY HELP BANGLADESHSO THAT OUR PROBLEM MAY WELL PROVE TO                            BE ONE OF TEMPERING THE NEW REGIMES EXPECTATIONS OF US4 WE CANNOT PRESENTLY JUDGE THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN MUSHTAQUES GOVERNMENT AND THE                            MILITARY WE NOTE WITH INTEREST

HAVE BEEN A PROMISE OF A NEW MORE                            LIBERAL CONSTITUATION THAN THAT IMPOSED LAST JANUARY BY MUJIB THE                            CIVILIANS PROBABLY HAVE A MOMENTARY ADVANTAGE

     SEEN IN EAST BENGAL SINCE PAKISTANI PERIODCONFIDENTIALCONFIDENTIALPAGE 04 DACCA 03964 161135Z5 ONE POINT TO BE EMPHASIZED IS THAT WHILE THE OVERTHROW OF SHEIKH MUJIB WAS SUCCESSFUL IF

RELATED TO THE NATURE AND MAGNITUDE OF THE                            RELATIONSHIP IT SHOULD BE SAID AT THE OUTSET THAT I DO NOT BELIEVE                            CEAUSESCU HAS TAKEN LEAVE OF HIS SENSES BY HAVING THIS HERETOFORE                            UNTOUCHABLE SUBJECT BROACHED WITH US THE GOR HAS TRADITIONALLY HAD AN                            UNCANNY SENSE ON HOW FAR IT COULD PUSH THE

FROM WEST ERUOPEAN NEUTRALS SINCE AS EARLY AS 1973 THE                            ROMANIAN RETIONALE THAT BY BUILDING UP ITS OWN DEFENSIVE CAPABILITY                            FROM WHATEVER SOURCE IT THEREBY ENHANCES THE CAPABILITY OF THE WARSAW                            PACT IS A TOUGH ARGUMENT TO PARRY  AT LEAST BY ITS PACT PARTNERS I                            CONCLUDE THAT THE ROMANIANS HAVE CONCLUDED THAT THE SCALE OF THE SUPPLY                            RELATIONSHIP THEY SEEK WITH THE US WHICH THEY PROBABLY DEFINE AS                            EXTREMELY LIMITED IS SUSCEPTIBLE TO SUFFICIENT IDEOLOGICAL AND MILITARY                            ARGUMENT TO COVER ANY CONCEIVABLE SOVIET RETALIATORY THREAT5 THE COST TO THE USSOVIET RELATIONSHIP IS ONE I BASICALLY LEAVE FOR                            YOU AND YOUR ASSOCIATES TO ANALYZE THOUGH I DO NOT SEE HOW IT WOULD                            PLEASE THE SOVIETS AND COULD SPAWN ENDLESS SOVIET AND WARSAW PACT

WOULD BE VIEWED BY THEM AS A PROVOCATIVE EXTENSION OF US MILITARY                            INFLUENCE TO A STATE ON ITS BORDER AND AT LEAST AN ELASTIC DEFINITION OF                            THE HELSINKI DOCUMENT6 FURTHER FACTORS ABOUT WHICH I SIMPLY DO NOT HAVE ENOUGH INFORMATION TO                            COMMENT AT ANY LENGTH BUT WHICH ARE OBVIOUSLY RELEVANT ARE OUR OVERALL
