               on Kurds Ref: Tehran 10459In 1975 the House                            of Representatives established the House Select Committee on                            Intelligence known as the Pike Committee to investigate possible                            abuses by the Intelligence Community The investigation covered CIA covert operations including that in                            support of the Kurds and highlevel officials notably Helms and Kissinger testified before it In telegram 10459 from                            Tehran October 28 Helms urged                                Kissinger to review the                            record of his testimony before the Pike Committee to prepare for the                            Secretarys own appearance Helms also noted that the CIA documentation held by the Committee was voluminous and                            inquired as to which communications channels remained secure if                            backchannel

after Shahs arrival from Ankara took occasion to mention that                        CBS News had carried story on November 1 which inter alia mentioned CIA operation to support Iraqi Kurds with                        tens of millions of dollars worth of Soviet armsTelegram 260094 to Tehran November 3 advised the                            Embassy that the story of US assistance to the Kurds had also appeared                            on the front page of The Washington Post In                            addition the Christian Science Monitor had                            reported that Barzani was in the United States for medical treatment as                            a guest of the CIA and that Sisco had visited him in the hospital                            The telegram stated that there would be no official comment on the                            allegations National Archives RG 59                            Central Foreign Policy Files D7503810723 Shah reacted with a                        smile rather than a frown and commented Yes that story was the first                        thing my government mentioned to me when I alighted at the airport a few                        minutes ago He did not pursue the matter and neither did I but I have no                        doubt I will hear more about it when there is no third party present Leaks                        such as this Schorr story right out of the Pike Committee only serve to                        persuade the Shah that the USG is incapable                        of keeping confidences or secrets2 Recognize how painfully aware you are of damage these leaks doTelegram 1115 from Baghdad November 4 noted that the                            Baghdad dailies had reported the story but blamed Nixon and downplayed the Iranian role                            apparently indicating that the government did not wish the story to                            disturb USIraqi relations or IraqiIranian

                      keep Department cables away from Congressional committees Incidentally                        Senator Fulbright threw up his hands                        when I asked what could be done to                        stop the hemorrhaging He indicated that he knew of nothing and opined that                        it would simply have to run its course much as he disapproved of what                        Congress was doing3 Set forth below is what less than 1 line not                            declassified what alerted me to the leak It is certainly what

on 6:30 broadcast 1 November stated that the Pike                        Committee had uncovered a CIA operation                        which delivered tens of millions of dollars worth of Soviet and Chinese                        Communist arms to the Iraqi Kurds Schorr said that the operation was                        conceived during the Nixon visit to                        Tehran in June 1972 Apparently the Shah requested that the USG provide this material and John Connally was sent to Tehran later                        that year in July to inform the Shah of the Presidents

make details of the operation public CIA                        officially denied comment according to Schorr who said however unofficial                            CIA sources claim the President had

       Ref: State 259582Document 1331 I appreciate timeliness of Dept decision to reduce staff and we are                            proceeding to implement instructions contained reftel However I want to make one                            final effort to persuade Dept to close post temporarily at this point                            rather than allow it to remain open with reduced staff for several                            additional days The question to be asked and answered it seems to me                            is what do we stand to gain and what price do we have to pay for keeping                            reduced staff here until Nov 10 1 lines not                                declassified I doubt very much that less                                than 1 line not declassified extra week here will                            significantly enhance our knowledge of state of play or future                            directions of MPLA or sources and                            extent and kind of outside assistance being given to MPLA2 2 lines not declassified only real value to                                USG of continued operation here                            would have to derive from posts ability to protect US citizens as well                            as those of UK and Canada This is                            important but I frankly think that ability of remaining Consular                            officers to render protection services is going to be sharply curtailed by circumstances The price                            that we may have to pay for this limited value operation is in the very                            great exposure and vulnerability of those USG officials who remain behind 3 lines                                not declassified As the FNLA                            military challenge to the MPLA becomes                            even stronger and we can expect that to happen between now and Nov 11                            and since Portuguese authority here is almost nonexistent now I think                            we have to accept possibility that MPLA hotheads might well find it necessary or convenient to                            arrest or detain one or more members of Consulate staff Even if this                            were not a real possibility I would still recommend closing of post now                            on grounds that prospective military situation between now and Nov 11                            will expose remaining USG personnel to                            unacceptable levels of personal danger and their ability to leave at the                            last minute will be severely curtailed by the lack of commercial                            transportation I have not yet been able to locate the High Commissioner                            today but I suspect the vessel in which he will leave is going to be                            fully loaded He just may have to refuse to take our six remaining                            employees3 In the event the Department decides to keep the post open for                            additional period both Rodgers and Doubleday have volunteered to stay                            In light of Rodgerss greater experience seniority and contacts I have                            asked him to remain CRO Casey will also stay4 2 lines not declassified5 After we close we will keep as many locals on the payroll as are                            willing to remain in Luanda A number of them have long years of service                            and we cannot in good conscience lay them off Too they will be needed                            for maintenance work and other services and we will want qualified                            people to be on board when we come back in6 I understand that ONA aircraft making                            final refugee flight is scheduled now to make ferry trip to Los Angeles                            following delivery of passengers to Lisbon and brief stop in Rome If                            this schedule holds I and staff and TDY personnel except those assigned elsewhere in Africa                            will remain on plane and ask to be dropped off at Dulles Airport rather                            than holding over in Lisbon I would appreciate if the Department could                            ensure ONA is directed to carry us as                            passengers LisbonWashington I am doing this on the assumption that my                            immediate availability to Dept would be useful in these final days                            before Angola independence and that it would be more economic in terms                            of dollars and manpower to move other staff members to Dept in this way                            rather than holding over in Lisbon for later commercial flightKilloran	19751102

on Nov 11 and it appears                            without transferring power to any one of the three major liberation                            movements In this event it seems certain that Sovietbacked Popular                            Movement for Liberation of Angola MPLA based in Luanda the capital will proclaim itself                            sole govt of Angola USSR intends to                            recognize MPLA regime immediately                            Most Communist powers and some progressive countries in Africa and                            elsewhere are likely to follow suit fairly quickly2 It is probable the two rival movements National Front for Liberation                            of Angola FNLA and National Union                            for Total Independence of Angola UNITA will also proclaim jointly their own regime3 MPLA likely to base its claim to                            legitimacy on purported control of capital of 12 of the 16 district                            capitals and of twothirds of Angolan territory and population It will                            presumably also repeat its current charges that other two movements are                            tools of the imperialists meaning Zaire South Africa US and France                            which have lost any right to represent Angolan people4 MPLA control is actually limited to                            six district capitals and only one entire district It controls about                            onethird of Angolas territory and people It also controls Luanda and                            the administrative structure remaining there after MPLA ejected FNLA and UNITA elements                            from Luanda last July ending transitional coalition govt composed of all                            three movements On the other hand FNLA and UNITA together                            control majority of territory and population and since July reverses                            have continued to make military comeback FNLA and UNITA forces                            have recently advanced close to Luanda in north and have recaptured key                            centers of Lobito and Benguela in south5 FYI On Nov 3 we temporarily closed our                            Consulate General in Luanda and withdrew its staff to Lisbon A Dept                            spokesman stated that the decision to close the Consulate was made for                            security and political reasons End FYI6 OAU which recognizes all three                            movements is currently engaged in last ditch effort to restore peace                            and to insure orderly transfer of sovereignty by Portugal It is our hope that this effort will                            succeed or at least provide opportunity for further negotiations among                            Angolans Present indications are that MPLA will probably not be deterred from unilaterally                            declaring independence and seeking widest possible international                            recognition as sole govt of Angola FNLAUNITA

bulk of the population of Angola We                            would view a claim by the MPLA that it                            is the government of Angola and that it merits recognition as such as                            unfounded because in fact it controls a minority of the population and                            territory of Angola and consequently is not in a position to represent                            the interests of the state of Angola internationally Recognition by the                            international community of the MPLA                            regime as the Angolan government could only serve as further obstacle to                            search for a peaceful negotiated solution and to validation of                            principle of selfdetermination The claim of FNLAUNITA would in our                            view deserve to be taken into account by the international community in                            weighing possibilities and timing of recognition of the state of Angola                            and of the government which actually exercises effective control of that                            state8

that they too would refrain from making any hasty                            move toward recognizing MPLA as                            government of Angola at time of independence9 Report results

legitimate government of Angola Simultaneously a government                            was proclaimed by the National Front FNLA and the National Union UNITA This government is headed by Holden Roberto of the FNLA with the Prime Minister to be named                            by UNITA The temporary capital is to                            be at Huambo formerly Nova Lisboa in the heart of

                   the United States has the fullest sympathy for people of Angola in the                            tragic circumstances attending their achievement of independence We                            strongly hope the OAU will succeed in                            bringing an early end to the fighting and in promoting negotiations                            among all Angolan parties We remain ready to assist the Angolan people                            in the vital task of building their nation End quote6 On November 10 the Secretary responded to two questions on Angola and                            Soviet involvement as follows:For the text                                of the November 10 press conference see Department of State Bulletin December 1 1975 pp                                776784Begin quote: Question: Mr Secretary will you discuss with us in some                            detail the nature and volume of the involvement of the Soviet Union and                            Cuba in Angola which unexpectedly got its independence a day early You                            mentioned this at a hearing the other day and I would like to know if                            it is in manpower dollars etcwhat you can tell us about itSecretary Kissinger: Well I                            dont have the figures here and I cannot go much beyond what I stated                            the other day which is that the Soviet Union earlier this year                            introduced a substantial amount of military equipment into                            Angolasubstantial in relation to the balance of forces that then                            existed that Cuba has also participated in the form of advisors and of                            military equipment We consider both of these steps by extracontinental                            powers a serious matter and really as far as the Soviet Union is                            concerned not compatible with the spirit of relaxation of tensionsQuestion: Sir we are also an extraterritorial power What are we                            doing thereSecretary Kissinger: Our interest                            in Angola which is related to the fact that the access to the sea of                            the surrounding countries goes through Angola was basically generated                            by the intervention of other countries The United States has no other                            interest except the territorial integrity and independence of Angola We                            strongly support the call of the Organization of African Unity for a                            ceasefire and for negotiation among the three factions that are                            involved there to form a coalition government and we have no United                            States interest to pursue in Angola End quote7 Posts should use own judgment on necessity of followup calls on their                            Foreign Ministries on Angolan recognition In general Department                            believes followup needed only in cases where host government wavering on recognizing MPLA or in cases where host governments                            asked to be kept informed on developments8 Neither MPLA regime nor FNLAUNITA government has submitted applications for membership                            in the UN although an MPLA delegation in New York has                            reportedly looked into the procedures of submitting an application We                            will of course not support UN                            membership for MPLA delegationFYI: Preliminary consultations at the UN indicate that should MPLA application be submitted to the                            Security Council it would likely receive only five votes of support                                USSR Byelorussia Iraq                            Mauritania and Tanzania

                    talks but Ankaras political exigencies require that any initiative on                            this subject come from the other side When one sees how difficult it                            has been for the GOT to achieve even                            this position a serious question arises as to whether once a                            negotiation begins there is any real possibility that the Turks can                            show even a minimum of flexibility or spirit of compromise DEMIREL and Caglayangil are adroit                            maneuverers and they may therefore find a way to do so especially if                            the military supports them behind the scenesbut our present assessment                            is that the odds of the PriMinFonMin team accomplishing this are very                            long against3 Unpromising as these odds are however I think we have for the                            present made all the approaches we should to the GOT on this subject We should now reserve our next round                            of effort for the period when the talks are actually about to start                            Then through both diplomatic and military channels we should do all we                            can to get the Turks to display at least the necessary minimum of                            flexibility on territory and other issues as the talks get                            underway4 With respect to a revised USTurkish defense cooperation relationship                            the situation is equally discouraging The Turkish opening position is a                            source of serious concern There is a onesidedness to the Turk position                            which radically undercuts the kind of mutuality of sacrifice and                            commitment that is essential for a viable relationship If I thought                            this Turk document was simply an extreme opening position in a tough                            bargaining situation I would not be as concerned as I am                            Unfortunately however while the Turks obviously have some give in                            their initial position I doubt that there is very much Moreover what                            little there is is not likely to be forthcoming very quickly5 Here again therefore an objective look at the situation brings                            disturbing conclusions We must recognize that the shortsighted                            requirements of Turkish nationalism and the weakness of the current                            government are likely to override a realistic sense of Turkeys security                            needs This could well mean that either A we will not be able to                            negotiate an acceptable basis for a security partnership on anything                            like the scale we have known here before or that in any event B this                            process will take so long that through an inevitable interim attrition                            our security position here will have largely disappeared long before a                            new modus vivendi is achieved6 Things do not have to turn out this badly of course I have scant                            hope that the Turks will respond affirmatively they have not yet given                            us an answer to the Secretarys request for a partial reactivation of                            closed Common Defense Installations CDIs as our revised security  relationship negotiations get underway I think there                            is some possibility however that as the negotiations proceed we will                            be able to bridge the gap in some areas of difference in a way that will                            permit at some point in the weeks ahead a resumption of some CDI activities here I do not think the                            prospects are particularly good for this but on the other hand the                            possibility cannot be ruled out In the meantime I urge that Washington                            adopt the Embassys recommendation that we eschew arguments over                            principle and instead go back to the Elekdag negotiators with a specific                            counterproposal as soon as possible Concerned as I am by a number of                            the unacceptable principles which underlie the Turk draft it is a                            losing game to take these principles on frontally The Turks with their                            weak government in their current super nationalist phase and in their                            post embargo period will be largely unyielding We must seek instead to                            find a practicable and acceptable modus vivendi out of the grey areas                            lying between the Turkish and American drafts We should support the                            basic points of our counterdraft by references to the essential                            partnership principles which underlie them but if we are to make any                            progress we must keep the basic negotiations away from arguments over                            principles and instead on modus vivendi specifics7 Serious as should be the state of our concern over the current                            USTurkish relationship we must carefully avoid for the present                            escalating this concern in a dramatic or confrontationtype way The                            embargoembroiled USTurkish relationship is far more bruised than                            sometimes is realizedand is badly in need of a respite After eight                            months of embargo the October 2 vote has supplied this in part but                            whatever respite we now have it needs to last somewhat longer before we                            can afford to get into anything like the early rounds of a showdown over                            the new defense cooperation relationship8 To avoid this latter and also not to undermine whatever influence we                            have on the Cyprus situation our counterposition respecting our                            future relationship on security should be pursued primarily in the                            ongoing Elekdag level negotiations and should not be escalated in any                            major way to higher levels of the GOT at this point If in these                            negotiations the gap subsequently proves to be as unbridgeable as I                            fear then that will be the time to escalate our efforts9 This does not mean we should not mention our concerns as I have done                            and will do again in a general way to the FonMin and high government officials here But the basic                            point is that despite the very serious nature of the problem we are                            facing visvis our future security relationship we should continue                            for the present to focus on negotiations Macomber channel and B while eschewing arguments over                            principle seek to narrow the gap in very specific areas between the two                            competing draft agreements10 The foregoing are my two major areas of conern and I will not                            lengthen this message further by detailing still others of considerable                            importance which have to dothe above problems asidewith the question                            of whether Turkey is going to remain capable of being an effective and                            useful ally The weak government situation here is not only a liability                            with respect to Cyprus and US security relationships The Turkish                            economy is in a deteriorating condition and no Turkish Government has                            taken effective measures to deal with it for a dangerously long period                            Reserves are declining inflation is rampant unemployment is                            staggering Student violence continues to paralyze major sections of the                            university community And under such circumstances of a deteriorating                            Turkish internal and international position the question that always                            lurks in the background is just how much more will the Turk military                            take before intervening11 Despite the foregoing catalog of problems however Turkish society                            remains relatively stable and resilient The Turks remain as one of the                            most courageous and patriotic people of any of our Western allies                            Turkish geography has not lost its value for the defense of the West                            nor have the Turkish people lost any of their zeal and determination to                            protect it from incursions from the North The game is therefore still                            very much worth the candle At the same time it is obvious that the                            nature of the relationship which has existed between Turkey and the US                            for 30 years is undergoing a serious sea change Down the road we should                            be able to reconstruct a new and viable relationship but in todays                            circumstances it seems almost inevitable that it will be a relationship                            based on less mutual sacrifice and less mutual confidence and                            commitment than that which existed prior to February 5 Macomber	19751105

            economic summit meeting in hopes that the issue of your participation                            might yet be resolved positively I regret to say however that                            although President Giscard                                dEstaing has not yet responded to my most recent message                            to him on this matterSee Document 113 I now seriously doubt                            that he will change his opposition before the summit convenesAs I believe you know from your Ambassador I have had several direct                            exchanges with Giscard over the                            past three weeks I had originally hoped that our approaches at lower                            levels would settle this issue promptly But these proved to be                            unavailing In my own contacts with the French President I told him                            firmly that I deemed it essential that Canada participate both because                            of our own direct interest and because of Canadas great weight                            internationally Giscards                            explicit responses referred to his concern that a further expansion of                            the original group would reduce the informality and flexibility of the                            occasion and to the difficulties we would encounter in declining the                            claims to participation from still additional countries especially in                            Europe and from international organizations like the OECDSee footnote 4 Document 106 and footnote 2 Document 113 I have                            told him categorically that I found these reasons unconvincing and                            completely outweighed by the political and economic logic of your                            participationI have also communicated either directly or through my representatives                            with the other summit participants and I know that all of them have                            strongly supported your participationSee                                    Document 111 It is in fact                            clear that only France objectsI have nevertheless concluded that the original purposes set for this                            summit meeting remain important and that the project should therefore go                            forward I believe that the peoples of the industrialized world and                            indeed of the world at large require a demonstration of political will                            from their leaders to show that we are determined to cope with the                            domestic and international economic problems which all of us confront                            And it is precisely for that reason that I was so anxious to have the                            benefit of your own contribution I have told the French that I will                            have great difficulty contemplating another gathering of this kind                            without your participation and that I will insist that Canada must be                            given full opportunity to be involved in whatever followup efforts may                            flow from the summit I will strongly reiterate

which you and your government have                            dealt with this problem I can assure you as your friend and neighbor                            that we will continue to keep you fully informed about developments                            connected with the summit and expect to collaborate with you on the                            vital issues that are to be discussed thereYours

frus1969-76v31d117	117 Telegram From the Department of State to the Embassies in Japan Italy the United Kingdom and the Federal Republic of Germany	None	1975-11-11 21:47:00	None	None	267049 Subject: Economic Summit For the Ambassador1 Please deliver the following letter from the President with                            appropriate salutation to Chancellor Schmidt and Prime Ministers Miki Moro and                                Wilson2 I am writing to share my thoughts with you as we prepare for the                            meeting at Rambouillet Although we have been careful not to lead public                            opinion to expect dramatic results I am convinced that we must see this                            unprecedented opportunity to begin to lay the foundations for a                            prolonged period of shared prosperity On reflection it seems to me                            that our publics and our parliaments will expect nothing less and that                            we can in fact achieve substantial progress3 Our first task at Rambouillet will be to build confidence in the                            economic recovery underway in the United States and Japan and which is                            beginning in Europe Here I believe a careful presentation of the most                            recent trends will be convincing4 Next we need to demonstrate to our publics our intention to direct                            the course of the recovery so as to maintain stable economic growth in                            the future In this connection we might consider whether closer                            cooperation among our officials responsible for economic policy coupled                            with the articulation of joint goals for the major industrialized                            economies would not be desirable These goals might be:To generalize the recovery during 1976 among the major industrial                                countriesTo seek to restore sustained vigorous economic expansion and high                                levels of employment by 1977To reduce inflation and disparities among national inflation                                ratesTo restore vigorous growth in trade5 Third our meeting must come to grips with the specific problems of                            trade money and energy6 Trade is clearly critical We should I believe provide needed                            impetus to the multilateral trade negotiations underway in Geneva                            setting 1977 as the deadline for their completion and identifying as our                            goals:A major cut in tariffs no less than that achieved in the                                    Kennedy RoundReduction

  pledge not to take restrictive action8 On monetary issues the divergent positions of a year ago have                            narrowed considerably These past weeks our representative Treasury

think                            that we should ourselves attempt to negotiate outstanding issues at the                            summit The time is too short the issues are often technical and it                            would be wrong to divert our efforts from what only we can doset                            fundamental policy directionsto what Ministers can do9 On energy a frank discussion of the position of our countries as we                            emerge from the recession and enter the economic dialogue with the                            developing countries and key OPEC                            members is clearly in orderIn the letter                                to Giscard the rest of the                                paragraph reads: My presentation on energy will include discussion                                of the energy situation in the United States the status of consumer                                country cooperation and our views on what can and cannot be done in                                energy in the dialogue Our view will be that the IEA countries must hold to their December 1                            deadline in the LongTerm Program including the minimum safeguard                            price We also ought to allow for some way for France to associate into that program once it is                            completed We will want to address the question of access to energy                            supply and investment within the IEA                            And we should talk about what we can and cannot do in energy in the                            dialogue10 Finally with the dialogue imminent and in the wake of the Seventh                            Special Session of the United NationsThe                                Seventh Special Session of the UN General Assembly convened                                September 116 to consider development and international economic                                cooperation it would be both appropriate and politic                            publicly to acknowledge the relationship of our deliberations to the                            aspirations of the developing world and to restate our commitment to a                            transformation of the relations between the industrialized and                            developing world11 As I now see it in order for our meeting to have the desired                            results we should prepare and issue a joint statement embodying our                            conclusions We are all firmly in agreement that our meeting should not                            concern itself unduly with the preparation of a text That task can be                            largely confided to the officials that will accompany us12 To provide you and your associates with a further indicationand some                            specificsof what we believe we might say in such a joint statement                                George Shultz our                            representative at the November 11 meeting in London is proposing a text                            which embodies our thinking on the issues to be addressed and our                            suggestions on what should be said publicly about themIn telegram 266579 to London November 11                                    Shultz and Dobbins received new instructions on                                the joint communiqu for the London preparatory meeting: Meeting                                this morning decided that we should

to ours Feeling here is that                                some document issued at the end of the summit is inevitable our                                interest is to make sure it reflects US

                     Group during the November 12 meeting Ibid1 Prior to opening of meeting Barre told Shultz                            privately that he had reviewed US draft joint statement thought such                            a statement would be useful and believed that US draft provided a                            good basis for discussion Shultz                            suggested Barre propose this to                            the group2 Shultz opened the meeting by                            calling attention to Secretary Kissingers Pittsburgh speech and briefing the group on                            the contents of President Fords                            message to his summit colleaguesSee footnote 2 Document 116 and Document 1173 Barre then suggested that group                            concentrate on language for a possible communiqu or statement He                            suggested the US draft be used for the basis for discussion Poehl                            who had just distributed copies of his own draft communiqu suggested                            instead a general discussion of agenda items He expressed doubt about                            the desirability of any sort of agreed statement and stated that in any                            case he did not believe that the US draft offered best basis for                            discussion After some discussion Poehl relented in face of other                            participants desire to proceed on basis of US draft4 The first four paragraphs of US text were accepted without comment                            As the discussion proceeded on subsequent paragraphs it became clear                            that a substantial coincidence on views existed Hunt suggested that group attempt to                            draft agreed text based on US draft which would be used to show                            heads of state what such a statement might look like Others agreed and                            text transmitted reftel is the                            result Next several paragraphs summarize discussion leading to                            agreement on that text5 Economic expansion: Barre and                            others objected to specifically setting 1977 as goal noting that in                            making such a statement governments were admitting inability to reach                            goal earlier and were also opening themselves to further criticism if                            goals were not reached by 1977 Hunt and Mitchell                            opposed here and throughout the discussion the slightest hint of any                            followon mechanisms whether among the Six or Seven inside or outside                            existing institutions Poehl resisted mention of reduction in                            disparities of inflation rates noting that this could be interpreted to                            mean low inflators such as the FRG                            would also have an obligation to inflate faster to close the gap6 Trade: Hunt said that while the                            UK was prepared to join in strong statement against protectionism                                Wilson would be politically                            unable to explicitly reaffirm OECD                            trade pledge He assured group that HMG is committed to resisting                            protectionism measures in all but exceptional cases that it intended to                            renew OECD pledgeSee Document 209                            in May when it expires but insisted that the pledge not be mentioned in                            this text Poehl found US                            statement on trade expansion goals too specific in some areas and too                            general in others He mentioned in particular EC sensitivity on agricultural issue Barre suggested alternative language                            found in text7 Monetary: Shultz opened                            monetary discussion by noting that group should avoid getting bogged                            down on this issue since status of discussions underway elsewhere would                            largely determine what sort of language could finally be adopted                                Ossola said that aside from                            the exchange rate issue renewed disagreements on the subject of gold                            now threatened success of January IMF                            meeting and could thus undermine any understandings reached on IMF quotas and exchange rates Barre proposed alternative language for                            this paragraph which was accepted with some amendments on the                            condition that it be bracketed to indicate its very preliminary and                            tentative nature8 Energy: Poehl maintained that industrialized countries had already                            largely adapted to energy price increase He said that there were no                            problems of access to supplies or of dependency on imports Oil was in                            surplus and one could have all one wished to buy Hunt sought language which would avoid                            implication of confrontation thus resisting suggestion that                            industrialized countries had power to remove massive increases in oil                            prices He proposed a favorable mention of upcoming CIECThe                                    CIEC met at the Ministerial                                level in Paris December 1619 See Document                                    300Barre did not wish to have any                            mention of IEA9 NorthSouth relations: There was a generally felt desire to specify                            some of the steps which the industrialized nations intended to take to                            assist third world specifically the trust fund and an export earnings                            stabilization scheme There was on the other hand equally general                            opposition to the notion that the industrialized nations should promise                            to be generous or copationate on their negotiations with the                            developing world10 EastWest trade: No changes were proposed Ossola said that Moro would raise problem of Soviet and Eastern European                            indebtedness he cited a figure of 25 billion their consequent                            creditworthiness and the problem of competitive Western credits He                            hoped the summit would stimulate greater Western consultation and                            cooperation on these issues11 In closing meeting Shultz                            summed up agreement Group would transmit their draft text not as                            proposed joint statement but as a broad example of what such a statement                            might look like They would suggest that designated officials meeting                            during the summit use it as a                            basis for drafting either a joint statement or if that was found                            undesirable agreed talking points It was agreed that distribution of                            draft text would be most severely limited within governments the debate                            centered on whether there could be one copy or two per government and                            the participants agreed to no comment any and all press inquiries about                            their meetingRichardson	19751112

Dobbins Subject: Economic                            Summit: Comments on November 1112 Carleton Group Meeting1 Most notable feature in meeting was overnight reversal of Barres position and attitude Last                            night he was proposing to have Giscard handle the briefing and interpretation of the                            summit Today he strongly supported American suggestion in favor of a                            draft joint statement sought agreement to use the US draft as the                            basis for such statement and when proposing alternative language was                            generally constructive Without Barres support group would never have adopted agreed                            text nor in fact would it have even focused on communiqu language for                            any length of time Barre said he                            had spent an hour with Giscard                            before coming to London Whether or not Barre received new instructions overnight Shultz feels that his performance                            reflects Giscards determination                            to make summit a success and his willingness to make certain concessions                            to ensure that it is2 Poehl was consistently unhelpful which Shultz notes is unlike him He opposed concept of a                            joint statement He opposed using US statement as its basis While                            some of his interventions were constructive others were carping and                                diversionaryIn a November 10 meeting                                with Ambassador Hillenbrand Phl was in a fairly pessimistic mood                                about the upcoming economic summit Telegram 18410 from Bonn                                November 11 ibidShultz notes however that Poehl                            had been out of touch with Schmidt                            for a couple of weeks and suggests that someone take Schmidts current temperature on the summit in the next                            day or two3 Hunt and Derek Mitchell were both adamant in                            opposition to any mention of followup in the communiqu reflecting                            perhaps HMGs reluctance to undertake still further obligations which                            might inhibit any unilateral actions it may at some time feel compelled                            to take They both strongly opposed not only the concept of new meetings                            among the Six or Seven in any forum but even resisted language stating                            simply that the summit participants would cooperate or consult in the                            future While no one else felt as strongly on the issue as they neither                            did anyone evince much enthusiasm for followon mechanisms4 Japanese feel they absolutely must have a communiqu or joint                            statement resulting from this summit They clearly have little                            confidence in their Prime Minister and wish to pin him down with                            communiqu negotiated by lower officials They will strongly support us                            in any efforts to get a joint statementJapanese language for the communiqu was transmitted in telegram                                17371 from London November 12 Ibid5 Shultz believes that Carleton                            Groups draft statement is pretty good first effort in some respects                            even an improvement over our own draft He recognizes that energy                            section is grossly inadequate but notes that effort to improve it will                            largely depend on our ability to convince summit participants that                            strong US energy conservation and development measures are in train or                            on the way He does not believe that too much attention need be given                            the current wording of the monetary paragraph feeling that its eventual                            wording will depend almost entirely on the state of Yeos current discussionsYeo was scheduled to meet with                                French officials on

      MINERAL DEPOSITS2 USUGANDAN RELATIONS: AMIN                            REFERRED TO THE MISUNDERSTANDING BETWEEN OUR TWO COUNTRIES AND SAID                            HE WAS SURE THAT THINGS

SAID HE                            WAS READY TO SEND A SENIOR MAN TO THE US AND HE ALLUDED TO THE ZIONISM                            QUESTION BY POINTING OUT THAT HE WAS NOT PERSONLLY ANTIISRAELI HE SAID HE HAD BEEN                            TALKING TO THE EGYPTIANS AND TO ARAFAT AND THOUGHT THAT AN ACCEPTABLE                            SOLUTION TO THE ISRAELI PROBLEM WOULD BE WORKED OUT AMIN THEN INSISTED THAT HE WAS NOT                            COMMITTED TO THE SOVIETS THEY WANTED ME TO BECOME A SOCIALIST IN                            RETURN FOR TWO SQUADRONS OF MIGS BUT I                            REFUSED HE SAID3 IN SUM AMIN ADMITTED THAT                            THERE WAS A SERIES OF ISSUES WHICH STOOD IN THE WAY OF CLOSE                            UGANDANAMERICAN RELATIONS BUT INSISTED THAT THESE COULD BE OVERCOME                            AND THAT HE WANTED VERY MUCH TO DO SO I WENT THROUGH MY TALKING POINTS                            AS AMENDED BY THE SECRETARY AND ALLOWED AS HOW THE PROBLEMS WHICH                            SEPARATED THE US AND UGANDA WERE NOT OF A BILATERAL NATURE AND WERE                            CAPABLE OF SOLUTION I SAID THAT I KNEW

THIS END I WAS SURE REAL PROGRESS COULD                            BE MADE I MADE NO PROMISES BUT AMIN SEEMED PLEASED 4 AFTER AGAIN ASSURING ME THAT AFRICA IN GENERAL AND UGANDA IN                            PARTICULAR ARE NOT COMMUNIST THAT THE US NOW HAD AN EXCELLENT                            OPPORTUNITY TO IMPROVE ITS POSITION IN AFRICA AMIN MADE A PITCH FOR ARMS MENTIONING

PROGRAMS AND UNDERLINED THE LONG LEAD TIME ASSOCIATED WITH FMS AMIN                            THEN PASSED ON TO WHAT HE DEFINED AS HIS NEED FOR AMERICAN EXPERTS IT                            COULD APPEAR THAT UGANDA HAD RECENTLY DISCOVERED LARGE GOLD COBALT AND                            OTHER MINERAL DESPOSITS AND AMIN                            WOUID LIKE A MISSION OF AMERICAN EXPERTS TO COME

                 EXPERTS I RESPONDED BY SAYING THAT I KNEW SEVERAL CONSULTING FIRMS                            EXPERT IN THE MINING FIELD AND THIS SEEMED TO SATISFY AMIN TELL THEM TO COME TO UGANDA HE

WHICH OVERTHREW MOSHTAQUE AND THE MAJORS                            APPEAR TO HAVE ACTED PRIMARILY OUT OF A SENSE OF GRIEVANCE AGAINST THE                            MAJORS THE COUNTERCOUP WAS THE
