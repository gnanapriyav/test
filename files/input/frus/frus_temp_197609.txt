                your assistance in developing the groundwork for an eventual dialogue                            with the Government of Angola The message from President Neto which your office sent on to us on                            August 31See Document 190 and footnote 2 thereto contained                            some positive elements and may provide an opening to further                            discussions We would appreciate it if the enclosed statement could be                            transmitted directly to President Neto by secure means3 Meanwhile we will be watching closely to see whether Angola reduces                            substantially the number of foreign troops stationed on its soil and                            whether Angola is prepared to play a constructive role during the                            current delicate phase of our negotiations to bring majority rule and                            independence to Namibia and Zimbabwe by peaceful means In this                            connection I note Netos                            attendance at the recent Dar es Salaam conference convened by President

among the                                Rhodesian black nationalist leaders4 Given the respect accorded Sweden throughout the Third World your                            cooperation in pursuit of both of these objectives is both helpful and                            very much appreciated Best regards Henry                                A Kissinger End of text to                                Swedes5 Begin separate text to the Angolans: The United                            States Government has read with interest the remarks of President                                Neto and shares his expressed                            desire to improve the relations between our two countries American                            officials have repeatedly stated that the US has no quarrel with the                            Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola and we have sought to                            make this clear through our actions on certain commercial matters over                            the past six months We maintain good and cooperative relations with                            many states whose ideology is different from ours6 Our concern since before independence has been that Angola should                            emerge as an independent sovereign state which would be spared                            convulsions of civil warfare We believed that only through some form of                            national reconciliation between the liberation movements could                            independence and peace emerge The unfortunate history of Angola since                            independence speaks for itself7 We think that it is in the interests of both our countries to promote                            stability and peace in central and southern Africa The presence of                            large numbers of foreign military personnel in Angola does not                            contribute to this goal8 The United States for its part wishes to make clear that it is neither                            encouraging nor supporting dissidents within Angola9 The US can appreciate Angolas interest in entering the United Nations                            this fall We hope in turn that President Neto can comprehend our concern over the continued                            presence in his country of a large army of a nonAfrican power which is                            notable for its hostility to the US and its apparent belief that the                            road to progress lies through armed confrontation rather than dialogue                            Our position on Angolas future admission to the UN will be considered in the context of the continued                            withdrawal of Cuban forces and Angolas attitude toward ongoing efforts                            to promote a peaceful transition to genuine majority rule in southern                                AfricaVoting against UN admission                                June 23 the United States emphasized the presence of Cuban troops                                in support of the Peoples Republic of Angola When the issue came                                before the Security Council on November 22 the vote was 13 in                                favor none against with the United States abstaining The General                                Assembly voted to admit the Peoples Republic of Angola to                                membership in the United Nations December 1 Yearbook of the United Nations 1976 pp                            30530810 In this regard we have been encouraged by the recent indications                            given to US officials by the Angolan Representative to the UN that the Cuban forces would confine                            their activities within the boundaries of Angola itself A policy of nonintervention in                            the affairs of neighboring territories will contribute to the goal we                            all seek of a peaceful transition to majority rule in southern Africa                            Angola is in a position to play constructive role in the delicate                            process evolving in southern Africa11 The US Government would welcome President Netos views about how we could best develop our                            contacts in a constructive way and about the situation in southern                            Africa We look forward to the time when we can have

                accepted our proposals They have agreed to:Majority rule within two years ie the Callaghan planImmediate negotiations with black representatives to create an interim                            government for the twoyear transitionA structure for the interim government that shares power giving blacks                            a majority of the Cabinet but giving whites the safeguard of a 5050                            split on a key executive body the Council of State The Council of                            State will supervise the drafting of the new constitutionThe British Parliment will enact enabling legislation reasserting their                            authority and the Rhodesians will then pass necessary legislation                            effecting the changesThe Rhodesians will insist that when the interim government is formed                                UN sanctions and guerrilla warfare                            will end The US and UK will

                  party caucus on Wednesday and Thursday If all goes well he pledged to                            me to announce the program as a Rhodesian offer to the blacks in a                            radiotelevision speech on Friday4 In the meantime I will show it to the blacks and insist upon their                            acceptance The delicacy of the next phase makes it vital that we                            prevent leaks until it is finished If it comes out in an uncontrolled                            way we could be beaten to death particularly by the radicals and                            Soviets who now have definite interest in derailing it5 The Rhodesians have also accepted in outline the economic guarantee                            scheme drawn up by us and the British This is now for negotiation with                            the blacks but the blacks have all told us they have no objection to                            it6 Smith and Vorster are fully                            aware of the disastrous consequencesto them above allif Smith fails to                            fulfill his commitment The international pressures will become                            massiveon both of themand the United States appearing to have been                            doublecrossed will have no                            choice but to join the pressures or at best let nature take its course                            as they are both engulfed by widening violence7 Vorster understands this                            completely and I must say both he and Smith have behaved honorably with                            me thus far Smith and his colleagues asked many questions groped for                            alternatives but came around inevitably to understand the necessity of                            what we proposed Smith too wants a rapid solution A which boosts                            the chances for moderates like Nkomo to take charge of the black government and B                            which insures conditions that will give the 270000 whites decent future                            and incentive to stay He and his colleagues acted with dignity and                            intelligencecontrary to all the predictions given to me8 This outcome gives me no pleasure It is extremely painful for me to                            be the instrument of their fatewhich could turn out to be disastrous                            That they have accepted with good grace only makes it harder I believe                            we must do all we can to see it through with care and make it work for                            the sake of both communities9 After my seven hours with Smith four hours in midmorning and three                            hours in the afternoon I spent two hours with VorsterKissinger met with                                    Vorster on September 19                                at the Prime

Ian Smiths                            speech as furnished by Harold                                Hawkins: Begin text:Z173 Prime Ministers address to the nation Friday 24th September

aware I have recently had a series of meetings in                            Pretoria firstly with the South African Prime Minister then with Dr                                Kissinger and finally with                            Dr Kissinger and Mr Vorster togetherSee Document                            206At these meetings the position of Rhodesia in relation to the rest of                            southern Africa and indeed to the Western nations was discussed in great detail It was made                            abundantly clear to me and to my colleagues who accompanied me that as                            long as the present circumstances in Rhodesia prevailed we could expect                            no help or support of any kind from the free world On the contrary the                            pressures on us from the free world would continue to mount Dr                                Kissinger has been working                            in close consultation with the British Government and he has the full                            support of the other major Western powersDr Kissinger assured me that we                            share a common aim and a common purpose namely to keep Rhodesia in the                            free world and to keep it free from Communist penetration In this                            regard of course Rhodesia is in a key position in southern Africa                            What happens here will inevitably affect the entire subcontinent                            Although we and the Western powers have a common purpose we differ from                            them in how best to achieve this I would be dishonest if I did not                            state quite clearly that the proposals which were put to us in Pretoria                            do not represent what in our view would be the best solution for                            Rhodesias problems Regrettably however we were not able to make our                            views prevail although we were able to achieve some modifications in                            the proposals The American and British Governments together with the                            major Western powers have made up their minds as to the kind of                            solution they wish to see in Rhodesia and they are determined to bring                            it about The alternative to acceptance of the proposals was explained                            to us in the clearest of terms which left no room for misunderstanding                            Since our return Cabinet have examined in great detail and in all its                            aspects the choice which faces us and we have done this in full                            knowledge of the heavy responsibility which we carry for the welfare and                            the safety of all Rhodesians white and black In the light of this                            assessment Cabinet had decided to accept the proposals put to us in                            Pretoria and the Parliamentary caucus of my party which met all day                            yesterday has endorsed our decisionBefore I spell out these proposals in detail there are some general                            comments I should make The proposals represent what in negotiating                            parlance is usually called a package deal which means that some                            aspects are more readily acceptable than others Firstly on the                            positive side as soon as the necessary preliminaries have been carried                            out sanctions will be lifted and there will be a cessation of                            terrorism Dr Kissinger has                            given me a categorical assurance to this effect and my acceptance of the                            proposals is conditional upon the implementation of both of these                            undertakingsIn the light of previous experience there will be some understandable                            scepticism regarding the undertaking that terrorism will cease but on                            this occasion the assurance is given not only on the authority of the                            United States Government but of the British Government as wellSince the weekend meetings we have reiterated to Dr Kissinger and those who are working                            with him our concern over their ability to fulfill their undertaking to                            halt terrorism and we stressed the responsibility which they carry in                            this regard They have reaffirmed to us their conviction that they will                            be able to ensure the implementation of this condition Nevertheless if                            we are realistic we must accept that terrorism cannot be halted at the                            drop of a hat and it will therefore be incumbent on the security forces                            and all those living in the affected areas to act accordingly Indeed                            it is likely that there might be an immediate and temporary increase in                            terrorist activityIt is also necessary for me to issue a warning with regard to sanctions                            It is essential that the security of commercial information should be                            strictly preserved in the coming months and all those concerned are                            urged to be particularly careful not to reveal any information bearing                            on the breaking of sanctionsSecondly together with the lifting of sanctions in all their forms there                            will be an injection of development capital which will provide an                            immediate stimulus to the economy Thirdly because the Western powers                            are mindful of the need to retain the confidence of the whites there                            will be other far reaching financial provisions I shall deal with these                            more fully later in my statementTurning now to the constitutional aspects the proposals provide for the                            setting up of an interim government comprising a Council of State and a                            Council of Ministers The Council of State will be the supreme body and                            it will have equal numbers of white and black members with a white                            chairman As is customary in the Cabinet system decisions will normally                            be reached by consensus but where a vote is necessary a twothirds                            majority will be required Its first duty will be to appoint the Council                            of Ministers However the most important function of the Council of                            State will be to draw up a new constitution Its deliberations will                            therefore be of vital significance for the future of our country and all                            of its people Its decisions will determine whether Rhodesia remains a                            stable democratic and progressive country It is important to note that                            this constitution will be drawn up in Rhodesia by Rhodesians and will                            not be imposed from outside I am confident that in these circumstances                            and given good will and realism on both sides the right decisions will                            be taken It will be a majority rule constitution and this is expressly                            laid down in the proposals My own position on majority rule is well                            known I have stated in public many times that I believe I echo the                            views of the majority of both black and white Rhodesians when I say                            that we support majority rule provided that it is responsible ruleThe Council of State will be given two years to complete its task of                            producing a constitution and undertaking all the detailed work necessary for elections on the basis                            of that constitution Some may regard this as too short a period but I                            believe there are advantages in aiming at reaching finality as soon as                            possibleHaving given you the general background I shall now read the actual                            terms of the proposals put to me by Dr Kissinger Paragraph six relating to economic aid is an                            agreed summary of a longer paper: Quote1 Rhodesia agrees to majority rule within two years2 Representatives of the Rhodesian Government will meet immediately at a                            mutually agreed place with African leaders to organize an interim                            government to function until majority rule is implemented3 The interim government should consist of a Council of State half of                            whose members will be black and half white with a white chairman without                            a special vote The European and African sides would nominate their                            representatives Its function should include: legislation general                            supervisory responsibilities and supervision of the process of drafting                            the constitution The interim government should also have a Council of                            Ministers with a majority of Africans and an African First Minister For                            the period of the interim government the Ministers of Defence and of Law                            and Order would be white Decisions of the Council of Ministers to be                            taken by twothirds majority Its functions should include: delegated                            legislative authority and executive responsibility4 The United Kingdom will enact enabling legislation for this process to                            majority rule Upon enactment of that legislation Rhodesia will also                            enact such legislation as may be necessary to the process5 Upon the establishment of the interim government sanctions will be                            lifted and all acts of war including guerilla warfare will cease6 Substantial economic support will be made available by the                            international community to provide assurance to Rhodesians about the                            economic future of the country A trust fund will be established outside                            Rhodesia which will organize and finance a major international effort to                            respond to the economic opportunities of this country and to the effects                            of the changes taking place The fund will inter alia support the                            internal and external economic circumstances of the country and provide                            development assistance guarantees and investment incentives to a wide                            variety of projects The aim will be to expand the industrial and                            mineral production of the country to enhance agricultural potential by                            suitable land utilization and development programmes and to provide the                            necessary training and educational facilities to provide the essential                            flow of skillsPension rights the investment of the individual in his own home andor                            farm and the remittances overseas of an individuals liquid resources                            within levels yet to be stipulated will be guaranteed by the interim and                            subsequent governments These particular measures will be underwritten by the trust fund thereby                            giving a firm international base to the government guarantee                            UnquoteThat was a brief outline of the proposed support measures which have now                            to be worked out in detail As I have said the measures in particular                            the trust fund are aimed at giving both the European and the African                            certainty as to his future in a multiracial socity and to demonstrate                            not only that the economic and social stability of the country will be                            maintained but that every individual can look forward to continued                            rising standards of livingIn our discussion in Pretoria my colleagues and I made it clear that                            Rhodesians were not enamoured of schemes to buy them outthey were                            looking for a solution which would mean that they could go on living in                            their homeland We were assured that the other parties to the proposal                            strongly supported this contention Accordingly whatever plan is                            produced to assist those who decide to leave the incentive should be                            aimed at making it worthwhile for Rhodesians to stayThose are the proposals which were put to us in Pretoria With the                            agreement of Cabinet and with the support of caucus I have sent a                            message to Dr Kissinger                            indicating my acceptance of the proposals subject to their being                            accepted by the other parties involved and as I stated earlier subject                            to the lifting of sanctions and the cessation of terrorismThe next stage will be the meeting between government representatives and                            African leaders to set up the Council of State as the first stage of                            establishing the interim government This I hope will take place as                            soon as possible because once the decision is taken it will be in the                            best interests of Rhodesia to proceed without delayI have given you the more important parts of what transpired during these                            negotiations Were I to continue talking for the next two hours I would                            not be able to tell you everything and unfortunately there is much                            which cannot be disclosed in public I hope you will derive some                            reassurance from the fact that my Cabinet and my caucus came to the                            clear and positive conclusion that on the evidence before us this is                            our best choiceWhat I have said this evening will be the cause of deep concern to you                            all and understandably so But we live in a world of rapid change and                            if we are to survive in such a world we must be prepared to adapt                            ourselves to change We have the satisfaction of knowing that in spite                            of the odds against us we Rhodesians of all races have built up a                            magnificent country where the prospects are second to none in Africa I                            hope and believe we shall be able to keep it soDespite the stresses and strains imposed by terrorism the relations                            between the races in our country remain friendly and relaxed We are                            moving steadily towards the removal of racial discrimination and this                            will be seen to an increasing extent as the recommendations of the Quenet Commission are                            implemented in the coming months I believe that it is incumbent on all                            of us white and black alike to act with dignity and restraint in the                            testing time which lies before us and to create the right atmosphere to                            enable those charged with the drawing up of our new constitution to                            proceed expeditiously with their important taskClearly this agreement doesnt give us the answer which we would have                            liked However it does present us with an opportunity which we have                            never had beforean offer to Rhodesians to work out amongst themselves                            without interference from outside our future constitution The Council                            of State has been charged to do this within two years which should be                            more than ample time As I have already indicated the Council of State                            will be composed of equal numbers of white and black Rhodesians They                            will be chosen by Rhodesians I hope they will be the best the most                            responsible we can find It will only be at the conclusion of this                            exercise that we will know whether this whole operation has succeeded or                            failed I hope all Rhodesians will join with me in dedicating themselves                            to ensure that there can only be one answersuccessMeanwhile I believe it is important that we maintain our morale and our                            confidence It would be unworthy of us after all we have been through                            after all the sacrifices which have been made to allow ourselves to                            fall into any premature despondency There is no doubt in my mind that                            the great fighting spirit of Rhodesians over the last decade has earned                            great respect from the rest of the world and had it not been for this                            the proposals which are now before us would not have been so                            favourableFor myself I hope to share the privilege of continuing to play a part in                            helping to guide the destiny of Rhodesia I remain dedicated to the                            ideal of doing all I can to ensure that Rhodesia remains a country in                            which all of us of whatever race or colour can live and work and                            prosper together in peace harmony and stability I have been                            tremendously gratified and encouraged by the messages of support which                            so many Rhodesians have sent me in the last week I am confident that                            the spirit and determination of Rhodesians remain undaunted and that we                            shall go forward together towards our goalBowdler	19760924

to President Kaunda2 Dear Mr President: I understand that you and President Nyerere will be meeting very shortly to                            discuss the Rhodesian situation Ian                                Smiths statementSee Document 209 and the next steps in                            a settlement I also understand that Prime Minister Callaghan has been in touch with                            you3 There are several points in my judgment that all of us must keep in                            mind as we consider what Ian                                Smith said First Smiths remarks were addressed to an                            audience which could only receive the news with the deepest sense of                            shock He therefore used language we would not have recommended but                            which has to be understood Second the Salisbury authorities are now                            irrevocably committed to majority rule within a twoyear period Third                            they are also committed to the principle of a black majority interim                            government Fourth the sixth point in Smiths announcementthe economic                            programis a matter for discussion with the members of an international                            consortium and not a subject on which the front line presidents need                            take a position Fifth the specificity of Smiths proposals is due in                            large part to our pressure We feared that a general proposal would only                            encourage him to procrastinate later4 There are aspects of Smiths announcement which will have to be                            developed in greater detail I would like to share with you my thoughts                            on the principal subjects:I do not believe that a meeting to negotiate the formation of an interim                            government need take place in Salisbury or anywhere else in Rhodesia                            Nor do I believe that it would be advisable to hold such a meeting in                            London We are prepared as you and I discussed to back the convening of                            the negotiations in any other place mutually convenient to all the                            parties involvedThere is no possibility that under the proposals Smith can run the                            show Indeed once the interim government is formed the present                            structure in Salisbury would disappearIt should be understood that each side in the negotiations will be free                            to nominate its communitys members to the Council of State Even though the Chairman of the                            Council of State would be European it is our understanding that he                            would have to be selected with the approval of the other members In                            short his selection could only be based on a consensus of the members                            at largeThe United States will promote no individual or faction on the African                            side That responsibility falls to the Rhodesian nationalists and in                            this matter you and President Nyerere have an important role to play5 I believe that the other questions raised by Ian Smiths statement are subject to                            negotiation It is my judgment however that an ungenerous response to                            Smiths statement at this point will give him the chance which he may                            wish to back away from his commitment We must avoid such an                            eventuality at all costs The proposals which we advanced to Smith are a                            distillation of the consultations we had with you and the other front                            line presidents and the United Kingdom6 We have done everything possible to bring matters this far and cannot                            be expected to continue our efforts if the framework which the Smith                            announcement offers does not lead to negotiations A breakdown in the                            settlement at this point could only lead to continued and escalating                            violence so a decision not to accept the opportunity now offered would                            be a serious one What is needed now in short is a positive response                            which will maintain momentum A positive response is needed from the                            African leaders now because we recognize that continued US pressure may                            be necessary to keep the Rhodesians to the execution of the conditions                            in the proposals This we pledge if the African response enables                            negotiations to go forward7 Your wisdom and foresight has been vital in bringing the process thus                            far and I completely share the views you so eloquently expressed that                            there may not be another opportunity and matters may take their                            inexorable course It is my earnest hope that the momentum towards a                            settlement and peace can be maintained and that the parties to the                            negotiations will meet without delay8 I look forward to having yours and President Nyereres and President Khamas

frus1969-76v28d212	212 Telegram From the Embassy in Zambia to the Department of State	None	1976-09-27 18:42:00	None	None	2599 Subj: Letter to Secretary from President KaundaThe following letter addressed to the Secretary was delivered to me this                            wayYour ExcellencyYour message of Sunday September 26 1976See Document 211 came at a most                            opportune time as it reached me in the midst of our summit It clarified                            a number of points which have been a source of worry to us and helped in                            facilitating the discussions Our conclusions were reached in the light                            of the continued commitment which you have shown in this important                            programmeI therefore want you to know once again that we genuinely value your                            efforts We can only urge you to continue As you say so much has been                            gained and success appears so nearAs Ambassador Low will have reported to you the summit was unanimous in                            its conclusions that a breakthrough has been made We were of course                            concerned as we believe you were about the manner in which Ian Smith presented the proposals                            which raised some doubts as to whether or not he could not once again                            upset the apple cart With our knowledge of him and his colleagues it                            is necessary to proceed in this exercise with caution while maintaining                            the momentum in the implementation of the AngloAmerican programme Our                            tactics must therefore be correctTo this end it is essential that Smith should not himself call the meeting since he has                            earned such a bad reputation In order to speed and maintain credibility                            right from the beginning it should be clear to everybody that it is not                                Smith who has the power to                            organise and manage the meeting of the representatives of the                            nationalists and the whites I need not mention that Smiths performance in this respect in                            the past left a good deal to be desiredWe therefore resolved to call upon Britain to organise and chair the                            meeting The purpose of the meeting should be:A to discuss the structure and functions of the transitional                            governmentB to establish an African majority transitional governmentC to discuss the modalities for convening a full constitutional                            conference to work out the independence constitutionD to establish the basis upon which peace and normalcy can be restored                            in the territoryWe believe that these requirements are within the general framework of                            the AngloAmerican proposals and that there is no contradiction between                            what you put forward and our stand in this connectionDuring our meeting we found some problems in the emphasis given by                                Smith to the Council of                            State We were happy though to note that the selection of the Chairman                            would be based on the consensus of all those involved This would remove                            Smith from the scene and this is important to the nationalists It                            would certainly remove the possibilities of a breakdown in the                            negotiations to establish the transitional governmentThe Council of State will certainly cause some anxieties British                            presence in the Council of State would be a source of confidence to the                            nationalists and I believe to the whites as well You should therefore                            consider the possibility of parity between nationalists and the                            Rhodesian Front in the Council of State but the Chairman being a Briton                            appointed by the British Government In this case the smaller the size                            of the Council of State the betterAnother problem is the allocation of portfolios At the moment all the                            military commanders and police are white and will presumably remain so                            throughout the period of transition The political head does not appear                            to be an overriding factor in a situation like this one It should                            therefore not come as a surprise if the nationalist side demands a more                            realistic approach in this matter and asks for slight adjustments to                            reflect the situation which will exist after the transitional period We                            believe that after confidence has been built up between whites and                            blacks and there is an acceptance of the transitional government the                            whites could possibly be made to realise that there would be greater                            security in making this readjustment at this timeWhen the details are being worked out it is problems like these that are                            bound to arise and it is in this context that you should read our                            penultimate paragraph in the statement issued by the five heads of state                            at the end of their summit in Lusaka on 26th September 1976For the text of the statement see The New York Times September 27 1976 p                                8Against this background I therefore urge you to put maximum pressure on                            the British to organise the meeting to establish a transitional                            government very quickly indeed I also urge you to pressure the South Africans to ensure that                            the whites in Rhodesia understand that they should go to the conference                            with an open mind to establish peace and stability The question of the                            cessation of the guerrilla war and the lifting of the sanctions will                            automatically follow the agreement to establish the transitional                            government The point is that we should form a transitional government                            with the degree of credibility that enables it to actually call upon the                            guerrilla fighters to cease fireOnce again I want to say how timely your letter was I also greatly                            appreciate the messageIn telegram 239446 to                                Lusaka

following                                statements made by black leaders at the Lusaka meeting September 26                                regarding the transition to majority rule Smith expressed concerns                                about Mugabe and appeared on                                the verge of renouncing his position however the South Africans                                persuaded him to stand firm Ibid2 Begin text:In my address to the nation on 25th September I indicated that my                            acceptance of the proposals had been forced on me by the Western powers                            who had made it clear that in our fight against terrorism and in our                            economic problems the present Rhodesian Government could expect no help                            or support of any kind from the West but that on the contrary if I did                            not accept the proposals the pressures on Rhodesia would be                            progressively increasedI have frequently warned in public statements and in exchanges with                            governments that a rapid handover to black rule in Rhodesia would lead                            to chaos which the Communists would be quick to exploit and which would                            cause the great majority of whites to leave the country These views are                            by no means confined to members of my government They have been stated                            repeatedly to British Government representatives by my political                            opponents and by a wide range of Rhodesian industrialists and                            businessmenIn forcing me into the position where I had no alternative but to accept                            the AngloAmerican proposals the Western governments concerned have                            discounted my own views and those of the responsible Rhodesians whom I                            have mentioned This places on the shoulders of these Western                            governments a heavy responsibility for what now ensues in RhodesiaDespite my misgivings I have gone out of my way to try to make these                            proposals acceptable to white Rhodesians and to encourage them to                            believe that it will be possible to establish responsible majority rule                            by a government which would realise the importance of the white people                            in maintaining the stability of the economy and the defence of the                            country and which would go out of their way to encourage them to stay                            In some quarters my efforts were greeted with scepticism but I                            persisted in the spirit as well as the letter of the agreement we                            reached in Pretoria My statement to the nation was couched in language                            designed to encourage white peopleand indeed moderate black peopleto                            believe that there would be a secure future for them in an independent                            RhodesiaThe immediate response to my speech was one of cautious support coupled                            with determination to make the best of the altered circumstances I must inform you however                            that in the last two days there has been a marked change in public                            opinion This has been caused mainly by the militant and the                            intransigent attitude of certain black presidents and by the statements                            of nationalists such as Mugabe of                            which you are no doubt aware The inclusion of President Neto at this late stage has contributed                            to the disillusionment felt here for he has nothing to gain from a                            Rhodesian settlement and is unlikely to exercise a moderating influence                            on Rhodesian Africans The failure of the latter to reach any agreement                            among themselves is a forewarning of coming power strugglesI have to tell you that I am becoming increasingly concerned about the                            situation If a man such as Mugabe is put forward by the black presidents as a                            leader of the African nationalists the effect on public opinion both                            among whites and among blacks will be extremely serious This man has a                            long record of Communist affiliation and he is now emerging as the                            apparent spokesman of the terrorists based in Mozambique His recent                            statements and those of the terrorist leaders can leave no room for any                            doubt as to their real intention which is to establish a Marxisttype                            military dictatorship in Rhodesia on the model of that in Mozambique It                            appears that in this aim they have the full support of President                                MachelIn the last two days I and my colleagues and other persons in authority                            or in touch with African opinion have received numerous expressions of                            real fear on the part of ordinary peaceful Rhodesian Africans who owe no                            allegiance to the terrorists and who give them no support other than                            that which is extracted by intimidation These people are imploring us                            not to hand over the Government of Rhodesia to the Mugabes and their                            like They are intelligent peoplebusinessmen farmers teachers and                            indeed politicianswho have the education and the background knowledge                            to appreciate what it would mean if men like Mugabe came to powerOn Friday afternoon I addressed a meeting of the top civil servants in                            the country I urged them to take the view that it was their duty as                            civil servants to do all they can to ease the transition to majority                            government and I assured them of my confidence that it would be a                            responsible majority government which would give all public servants                            reasonable prospects of a satisfying career in a country in which they                            would be happy to have their children grow up and be educated I met                            with a favourable response However again in this field the situation                            has changed drastically this week Public servants at all levels are now                            questioning the validity of my assurances and there are strong                            indications that many of them will want to leave the country They have                            noted the reported words of President Nyerere to the effect that the economic aid provided by                            the Western world should be used to encourage the whites to go and not to stay and they                            have noted similar remarks by President Machel and Mugabe They are now asking that the government should make                            special provision for them to be able to leave before independence with                            terminal benefits to compensate for loss of careerOther important categories in a similar position are members of the armed                            forces and the staffs of statutory bodies such as the Rhodesia Railways                            and the Posts and Telecommunications Corporation The latter have skills                            which would be in high demand elsewhere and their departure would be a                            crippling blow to the Rhodesian economyI am particularly concerned about the need to maintain morale and                            motivation in the security forces during the period of the interim                            government because so far there is no indication of any intention on the                            part of the Mozambique Government or of the terrorists operating out of                            that territory to halt their attacks On the contrary I anticipate that                            the latter will endeavour with Communist support to establish a firm                            foothold in a sector of Rhodesia adjacent to the Mozambique borderI feel that I must warn you that unless steps are taken urgently to                            reverse the current trend of loss of confidence among white Rhodesians                            the position will continue to deteriorate and there will be a real                            danger of a collapse of the economy and of the whole complex structure                            of government and of the security forces If this should happen the                            Western powers who have forced Rhodesia into this situation will bear a                            heavy responsibility End

ADDRESSED DURING THE SESSIONTHE FORMAL POSITION OF THE GROUP OF 77 WAS THAT THE SYSTEM OF                            EXPLOITATION PREVIOUSLY NEGOTIATED AND CONTAINED IN THE REVISED SINGLE

          SYSTEM SINCE THE QUESTION OF THE METHODS OF OPERATION FOR THE                            ENTERPRISE WAS NOT IN THE FOREFRONT OF THE COMMITTEES WORK ITS                            CONSIDERATION OF THE PARALLEL SYSTEM OF EXPLOITATION BECAME SOMEWHAT                            UNBALANCED WITH UNDUE EMPHASIS BEING PLACED IN ITS DELIBERATIONS ON                            ONLY THE

SESSION HOWEVER GREATER INTEREST WAS EXPRESSED                            IN THE POTENTIAL FOR STRENGTHENING THE ABILITY OF THE ENTERPRISE TO                            FUNCTION WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF A PARALLEL SYSTEM SUCH AS THAT                            ESTABLISHED IN THE RSNT A TREND THAT                            WAS NO DOUBT STIMULATED BY THE COMPROMISE PROPOSALS MADE IN THIS AREA BY                            SECRETARY KISSINGER DURING HIS                            SEPTEMBER 12 VISIT AT THE CONFERENCE THE SECRETARY NOTED THAT MANY                            COUNTRIES HAD EXPRESSED DOUBTS ABOUT THE PARALLEL SYSTEM ON THE GROUNDS                            THAT IT DID NO GOOD TO SET ASIDE PART OF THE MINE SITES FOR THE                            AUTHORITY IF IT DID NOT POSSESS THE FINANCIAL RESOURCES OR THE                            TECHNOLOGY TO EXPLOIT THESE SITES IN VIEW OF THIS CONCERN THE                            SECRETARY SAID THAT THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT WOULD BE PREPARED TO                            AGREE TO A MEANS OF FINANCING THE ENTERPRISE SO THAT IT COULD BEGIN                            MINING OPERATIONS IN THE SAME TIME FRAME THAT STATE AND PRIVATE                            OPERATORS COULD BEGIN EXPLOITATION OF THE SEABEDTHE SECRETARY ALSO NOTED THAT THE CONCERNS OF SOME DELEGATIONS THAT IT                            WAS PREMATURE TO ESTABLISH A PERMANENT REGIME FOR THE DEEP SEABEDS IN                            LIGHT OF THE MANY UNKNOWNS IN THIS FIELD AND HE SUGGESTED PERIODIC                            REVIEW CONFERENCES  PERHAPS AT TWENTYFIVE YEAR INTERVALS  IN WHICH                            THE SYSTEM COULD BE REEXAMINED ALTHOUGH EXISTING CONTRACTS WOULD OF                            COURSE BE RESPECTED THE SECRETARY EMPHASIZED THAT THESE NEW PROPOSALS                            WERE RESPONSIVE TO THE LEGITIMATE CONCERNS OF THE GROUP OF 77 AND THAT                            WE NOW REQUIRED SIMILAR RESPONSES TO OUR CONCERNS PARTICULARLY ON THE                            ISSUES OF GUARANTEED ACCESS AVOIDANCE OF PRODUCTION CONTROLS AND A                            SUITABLE ASSEMBLY AND COUNCILTHESE PROPOSALS OF THE SECRETARY WERE NOT DISCUSSED WITHIN COMMITTEE I                            BECAUSE OF THE LIMITED TIME REMAINING IN THE SESSION BUT A NUMBER OF                            DELEGATIONS EXPRESSED INTEREST AND A DESIRE TO PURSUE THE SUBJECTS                            MENTIONED BY THE SECRETARY IN GREATER DETAIL AT THE NEXT SESSION                            FOLLOWING THE SECRETARYS INITIATIVES A MARKED CHANGE OCCURRED IN THE                            NEGOTIATING ATMOSPHERE OF COMMITTEE I IN THAT THE TENDENCY TO CONSIDER                            STATE AND PRIVATE PARTY ACCESS IN ISOLATION WAS REDUCED A MORE                            CONSTRUCTIVE WILLINGNESS TO ADDRESS THE ENTIRE COMPLEX OF ISSUES                            INVOLVED IN THE SYSTEM OF EXPLOITATION APPEAREDOUTLOOKTHE OUTLOOK FOR THE NEGOTIATIONS IN COMMITTEE I IS UNCLEAR IF ONE                            CHOOSES TO LOOK ONLY AT THE NEGATIVE FACTORS THE PICTURE IS GLUM                            INDEED: THIS SESSION PRODUCED NO CONCRETE RESULTS AND THERE IS LITTLE                            HARD EVIDENCE THAT THE APPARENT GAP IN POSITIONS ON THE SYSTEM OF                            EXPLOITATION WAS NARROWED IN ADDITION TO THE SYSTEM OF EXPLOITATION                            DISCUSSED AT THIS SESSION THERE ARE MAJOR ISSUES YET TO BE NEGOTIATED                            SUCH AS THE COMPOSITION AND DECISIONMAKING PROCEDURES OF THE COUNCIL                            FURTHER MEMBERS OF THE GROUP OF 77 HAVE IDENTIFIED OTHER ISSUES OF                            CONCERN SUCH AS THE POWERS AND VOTING PROCEDURES IN THE ASSEMBLY ITS                            RELATIONSHIP TO THE COUNCIL PRODUCTION CONTROLS AND THE DISPUTE                            SETTLEMENT MECHANISM IN COMMITTEE I THESE ARE COMPLEX ISSUES WHICH WILL                            TAKE MUCH TIME TO NEGOTIATE UNLESS PROCEDURES CAN BE DEVELOPED WHICH                            PERMIT NEGOTIATIONS AMONG REPRESENTATIVE GROUPSMOREOVER A PARTICULARLY DISTURBING DEVELOPMENT AT THIS SESSION WAS THE                            INDICATION THAT A FEW DEVELOPING COUNTRIES FOR THE FIRST TIME IN THE                            NEGOTIATIONS ARE CONSIDERING SUPPORT OF A STATE QUOTA OR ANTIMONOPOLY                            PROVISION A TREND THAT WOULD SERIOUSLY IMPEDE THE CHANCES FOR REACHING                            AN ACCEPTABLE DEEP SEABED ACCOMMODATIONON THE OTHER HAND THERE ARE POSITIVE FACTORS IT IS APPARENT THAT MANY                            OF THE PROBLEMS THIS SESSION WERE CAUSED BY THE INSUFFICIENT TIME                            AVAILABLE BETWEEN THE TWO NEW YORK MEETINGS IN WHICH TO DIGEST THE WORK                            OF THE EARLIER CONFERENCE AND TO FORMULATE NEW POSITIONS IN ADDITION                            AT THE END OF THIS SESSION THERE APPEARED TO BE WIDESPREAD RECOGNITION                            THAT THE COMMITTEE COULD NOT AFFORD ANOTHER UNPRODUCTIVE MEETING SUCH AS                            THIS ONE AND THAT AT THE NEXT SESSION DELEGATIONS AND GROUPS MUST COME                            PREPARED TO MAKE THE HARD POLITICAL COMPROMISES NECESSARY TO REACH                            AGREEMENT MOREOVER WE BELIEVE THAT MOST DELEGATIONS HAVE A BETTER                            APPRECIATION OF THE MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS OF THE VARIOUS GROUPS AND                            RECOGNIZE THAT THE SUBSTANCE OF THE RSNT                            ON MANY OF THE ISSUES INVOLVED IN THE SYSTEM OF EXPLOITATION REPRESENTS                            THE PROBABLE OUTLINE OF A FINAL COMPROMISE SETTLEMENT WHICH COULD MEET                            THE ESSENTIAL NEEDS OF ALL GROUPS IN THE ABSENCE OF IDEOLOGY AND GROUP                            POLITICSAS IT TURNED OUT THIS SESSION HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO THOSE DELEGATIONS IN                            THE GROUP OF 77 HOLDING MORE EXTREME POSITIONS TO DOMINATE THE 77 AND                            ATTEMPT TO OBTAIN FURTHER CONCESSIONS OF SUBSTANCE FROM THE                            INDUSTRIALIZED COUNTRIES IT BECAME APPARENT THAT THERE IS NO FURTHER                            GIVE IN THESE POSITIONS HOWEVER AND TOWARD THE END MODERATING                            INFLUENCES IN THE UN BEGAN TO EMERGE                            VOCALLY AND RESUME LEADERSHIP IF THIS PROCESS CONTINUES WE MAY FIND                            SOMEWHAT BETTER CLIMATE FOR NEGOTIATION AT THE NEXT SESSION                            NEVERTHELESS IT MUST BE RECOGNIZED THAT THE ISSUES WHICH DID NOT COME                            UP AT THIS SESSION ARE AT LEAST AS DIFFICULT AND IMPORTANT AS THE SYSTEM                            OF EXPLOITATION AND THAT DURING THIS SESSION THE GROUP OF 77 ADOPTED                            THOUGH THEY DID NOT TABLE VERY TOUGH EXTREMIST POSITIONS ON THEM                            THESE POSITIONS UNLESS MODERATED PRIOR TO THE NEXT SESSION COULD CAUSE                            THE NEXT SESSION TO END IN STALEMATE TOOIT SHOULD BE NOTED A MENTIONED ABOVE THAT THERE IS SOME RECOGNITION                            THAT THE NEGOTIATING DIFFICULTIES IN COMMITTEE I MAY BE PARTIALLY                            ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE PROCEDURES IT HAS UTILIZED AS WELL AS TIMING                            FACTORS IN THIS CONNECTION THE FINAL REPORT OF THE CHAIRMAN OF                            COMMITTEE I PAUL ENGO EMPHASIZED                            THAT NEW PROCEDURAL APPROACHES SUCH AS VOTING MAY IN HIS VIEW BE                            NEEDED AT THE NEXT SESSION IN ORDER TO ENCOURAGE DELEGATIONS TO TAKE THE                            FINAL DECISIONS NECESSARY TO PRODUCE WIDESPREAD AGREEMENTCOMMITTEE IIPROCEDURESALL NEGOTIATING AT THIS SESSION WAS CONDUCTED IN OPENENDED NEGOTIATING                            GROUPS ESTABLISHED BY THE CHAIRMAN AND IN SMALL GROUPS WHEN IT                            APPEARED THAT THE NEGOTIATING GROUPS HAD CARRIED ISSUES AS FAR AS                            POSSIBLE THE ESSENTIAL OBJECTIVE WAS TO DEAL INTENSIVELY WITH ISSUES                            IDENTIFIED BY THE COMMITTEE AS PRIORITY ISSUES INITIALLY THE                            NEGOTIATING GROUPS WERE SET UP TO DEAL WITH FOUR QUOTE PRIORITY UNQUOTE                            ISSUES IE THE LEGAL STATUS OF THE ECONOMIC ZONE AND THE RIGHTS AND

FOR THE UNITED                            STATES IN COMMITTEE II WAS AND REMAINS THE JURIDICAL STATUS OF THE                            ECONOMIC ZONE THE US OBJECTIVE IN THIS REGARD IS TO RETAIN THIS                            TRADITIONAL HIGH SEAS STATUS OF THE ZONE EXCEPT FOR RIGHTS OVER                            RESOURCES AND OTHER LIMITED RIGHTS WHICH HAD PREVIOUSLY BEEN HIGH SEAS

            REASON TOLEGITIMIZE THE VAST COASTAL STATE RESOURCE GRAB IF THEY                            DO NOT GET GREATER RIGHTS IN THE TREATY THAN THEY MIGHT ACHIEVE

IS PRESUMED IF NO                            REPLY IS RECEIVED AFTER A SPECIFIED TIME IS THAT THEY BELIEVE THIS BEST                            APPROXIMATES THE CURRENT SITUATION IN WHICH COASTAL

STATES ARE FACING A                            BALANCE IN THE TREATY THAT IS A ROUGH APPROXIMATION OF SUBSTANTIVE GAINS                            AND LOSSES THAT WOULD OBTAIN WITHOUT A TREATY AS THEY

IUS OBJECTIVES AT THIS SESSION1 THE UNITED STATES DELEGATION HAD TWO ALTERNATIVE OBJECTIVES TO BE                            ACHIEVED IN COMMITTEE I DURING THE AUGUSTSEPTEMBER SESSION THE FIRST                            WOULD HAVE BEEN TO COMPLETE THE MAJOR SUBSTANTIVE NEGOTIATION OF PART I                            OF THE TREATY AND TO BE PREPARED TO FINALIZE THE TREATY AT A SUBSEQUENT                            SESSION THE ATTAINMENT OF THIS OBJECTIVE WOULD HAVE REQUIRED A VIRTUAL                            ENDORSEMENT BY THE COMMITTEE OF THOSE PROVISIONS OF THE REVISED SNT PRIVATELY NEGOTIATED AT THE SPRING                            SESSION THIS PROVED IMPOSSIBLE2 THE SECOND ALTERNATIVE OBJECTIVE WAS TO PRESERVE THE AGREEMENTS                            REACHED IN THE REVISED SNT THE BULK OF                            WHICH IS ACCEPTABLE TO THE US IN THE EVENT THAT IT WAS NOT POSSIBLE TO                            CONTINUE THE NEGOTIATING MOMENTUM REACHED AT THE LAST SESSION AND                            CONCLUDE THE COMMITTEE I NEGOTIATION THIS OBJECTIVE WAS ACHIEVED3 DURING THE LAST SESSION WE NEGOTIATED IN PRIVATE WITH THE SECRET

TREATY AT THE END WHEN IT BECAME OBVIOUS THAT CHAIRMAN PAUL ENGO WAS TO ISSUE A NEW SNT BASED ON THE OUTCOME OF PRIVATE                            NEGOTIATIONS THE GROUP OF 77 REACTED STRONGLY AND THERE WAS SOME CHANCE                            THAT THE REVISED SNT WOULD BE TOTALLY                            REJECTED THUS THOSE MODERATE LDC                            LEADERS WHO HAD NEGOTIATED WITH US IN THE SECRET BRAZIL GROUP CAME TO                            THIS SESSION SOMEWHAT DISCREDITED THE EXTREMIST LEADERS IN THE 77 WHO                            HAD ORIGINALLY ATTACKED THE NEW

BEEN CAPABLE OF RESUMING THEIR PAST LEADERSHIP                            ROLE IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN POSSIBLE TO HAVE COMPLETED THE MAJOR                            SUBSTANTIVE NEGOTIATION IN COMMITTEE I HOWEVER THEY DID NOT INITIALLY                            AND THE GROUP OF 77 BEGAN SYSTEMATICALLY TO REOPEN THE PRINCIPAL                            PROVISIONS OF THE RSNT WE USED STALLING

SUCCESSFUL IN PRESERVING THE RSNT BUT THIS MUST BE QUALIFIED SINCE THE                            GROUP OF 77 HAS NOW DEVELOPED CONSENSUS HARDLINE POSITIONS ON MOST OF                            THE PRINCIPAL ISSUES IN THE NEGOTIATION  THE SYSTEM OF EXPLOITATION                            THE POWERS OF THE ASSEMBLY AND COUNCIL AND THEIR VOTING PROCEDURES AND

CONCEPTDEVELOPMENTS IN COMMITTEE I AT THIS SESSION6 THE WORKING GROUP OF COMMITTEE I DISCUSSED THE SYSTEM OF EXPLOITATION                            EXCLUSIVELY AND EVEN THEN DEALT ONLY WITH THE QUESTION OF STATE AND                            PRIVATE PARTY ACCESS7 MANY LDCS WERE DISSATISFIED WITH THE PARALLEL SYSTEM OF EXPLOITATION                            IN THE RSNT SOME SEEMED CONCERNED ABOUT                            THE INABILITY OF THE ENTERPRISE TO COMPETE ON AN EQUAL FOOTING WITH                            STATES OTHERS OBJECTED TO QUOTE AUTOMATICALLY UNQUOTE OF ACCESS FOR

OF EXPLOITATION WAS CARRIED OUT ON TWO                            LEVELS THE FIRST BEING THE ACCEPTABILITY OF THE PARALLEL SYSTEM IN                            PRINCIPLE THE SECOND CONCERNED THE POTENTIAL FOR OBJECTIVE CRITERIA FOR                            GRANTING ACCESS TO STATES AND PRIVATE COMPANIES WHICH WOULD LIMIT THE                            AUTHORITYS DISCRETION TO REFUSE ARBITRARILY TO CONCLUDE A CONTRACT WITH                            A QUALIFIED APPLICANT10 OUR INTERPRETATION OF THESE DISCUSSIONS IS THAT MANY LDCS WOULD BE                            PREPARED TO ACCEPT SOME LIMITATIONS ON THE AUTHORITYS DISCRETION OVER                            STATE ACCESS PURSUANT TO TREATY CRITERIA WHILE THE LDCS COULD PROBABLY                            AGREE TO INCLUSION OF CRITERIA IT IS VERY DOUBTFUL THAT THEY WOULD                            AGREE TO SPECIFIC DETAILED AND OBJECTIVE CRITERIA WHICH WE SEEK THIS                            POINT WAS MADE

COUNCIL WERE NOT DISCUSSED IN THE                            COMMITTEE BUT THE GROUP OF 77 FORMULATED CONSENSUS POSITIONS ON THE                            RELEVANT ARTICLES WHICH REMOVE MOST OF THE PROCEDURAL PROTECTIONS FOR                            INDUSTRIALIZED COUNTRIES IN THE RSNT                            PROVISIONS ON ASSEMBLY VOTING AND POWERS AND MAKE THE ASSEMBLY THE

APPROACH IS GENERALLY SUPPORTED BY FRANCE THE USSR AND JAPAN ALTHOUGH THE UK CONTINUES TO OPPOSE IT ON THE GROUND THAT IT IS FAR TOO                            EXTREME AND WILL BE PERCEIVED AS QUOTE CONFERENCEWRECKING UNQUOTE13 WHILE NO DISCUSSION OF ARTICLE 9 OCCURRED IN THE COMMITTEE THE GROUP                            OF 77 DID INTERNALLY APPROVE A REVISED TEXT WHICH TRACKS CANADAS

SECRETARYS PROPOSAL FOR A PERIODIC REVIEW CONFERENCE WAS ALSO HELPFUL                            IN ITS ATTEMPT TO FIND A WAY OF ALLAYING THE FEARS OF A PERMANENT                            IMPOSITION

THERE WERE SEVERAL                            BASIC AND HIGHLY POLITICAL QUESTIONS THAT WOULD HAVE TO BE ANSWERED                            BEFORE ANY ACTUAL DRAFTING OF A COMPROMISE TEXT COULD BE UNDERTAKEN                            THESE QUESTIONS SHOULD BE ANSWERED AT THE HIGHEST POLITICAL LEVEL AND A                            DECISION MADE WITHIN THE FIRST WEEK OR TWO OF THE NEXT

CONCLUSION OF THE NEGOTIATION COULD WELL REQUIRE                            THE US TO AGREE TO COMPROMISES BETWEEN THE RSNT WHICH WE ALREADY BELIEVE TO BE NOT FULLY IN THE

         HAVE BEEN CONTROLLED BY A NUMBER OF ADVERSE FACTORS WE ARE UNABLE                            RELIABLY TO ANSWER THE QUESTION WHY THESE FACTORS FOUND SUCH FERTILE                            GROUND AMONG THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE DEVELOPING COUNTRIES AND WHY THEY                            WERE PERMITTED TO DICTATE THE OUTCOME OF THE SESSION IN SOME CASES THE                            UNDERLYING CAUSES OF THESE FACTORS MAY BE TEMPORARY IN CHARACTER IN                            OTHERS THEY MAY BE ENDEMIC BUT SUSCEPTIBLE TO CONTROL IN STILL OTHERS                            THESE CAUSES MAY ARISE FROM FUNDAMENTAL PROBLEMS24 FACTORS WHICH MAY ARISE FROM TEMPORARY PROBLEMS INCLUDE: THE ADVERSE GROUP OF 77 REACTION TO THE PROVISIONS OF THE RSNT AND THE MANNER IN WHICH IT WAS                            PREPARED THE ABSENCE OF EFFECTIVE LEADERSHIP IN COMMITTEE I WHICH MADE IT                            LITERALLY IMPOSSIBLE FOR THE COMMITTEE TO ACCOMPLISH ANYTHING MORE THAN                            A SPINNING OF ITS WHEELS FOR THE ENTIRE COURSE OF THE SESSION                            SIMILARLY THE INABILITY OF PAST LDC                            LEADERS THOSE MEMBERS OF THE SECRET BRAZIL GROUP TO CONTROL THE GROUP                            OF 77 MADE IT POSSIBLE FOR THE EXTREMISTS TO GOVERN THE GROUP OF 77S                            ACTIONS IF IS NOT INCONCEIVABLE THAT THE REINSTATEMENT OF MORE                            COMPETENT LEADERSHIP MIGHT MAKE A SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE IN THE RATE OF                            PROGRESS AT THE NEXT SESSION ALSO THIS SESSION PROCEDURAL EMPHASIS ON ALLOWING THE GROUP OF 77                            TIME TO MEET SEPARATELY PERMITTED IT TO RETAIN ITS COHESIVENESS AND TO                            DEVELOP CONSENSUS POSITIONS ON PRINCIPAL ISSUES IN THE PAST WHEN                            COMMITTEE I HAS MOVED RAPIDLY WITH NO TIME FOR GROUP OF 77 CONSULTATION                            MODERATE LDCS HAVE BROKEN RANKS WITH EXTREMIST IDEOLOGY A PERSISTENT BELIEF THAT US POSITIONS IN COMMITTEE I WOULD BE MORE                            FORTHCOMING IN THE EVENT OF A DEMOCRATIC ADMINISTRATION COUPLED WITH A                            CALCULATED ASSESSMENT THAT UNILATERAL ACTION BY OUR CONGRESS WAS                            IMPOSSIBLE BEFORE THE NEXT SESSION COULD BE CONVENEDWE DO NOT KNOW WHETHER THESE PROBLEMS ARE IN FACT TEMPORARY ONES THAT                            AROSE FROM UNIQUE COMBINATIONS OF EVENTS AT THIS SESSION WE HAVE                            EXPERIENCED SOME OF THEM AS PAST SESSIONS OF COMMITTEE I AND HAVE NO                            CERTAIN BASIS FOR PREDICTING THAT THEY WILL NOT REEMERGE IN SUBSEQUENT                            NEGOTIATIONS25 FACTORS WHICH MAY ARISE FROM DEEPROOTED PROBLEMS WHICH MAY WELL                            AFFECT FUTURE NEGOTIATIONS INCLUDE: THERE COULD BE A LACK OF LDC INTEREST IN                            PRESERVING THE MOMENTUM OF THE NEGOTIATION THIS COULD RESULT FROM A                            BELIEF THAT A TREATY ON COMMITTEES II AND III MATTERS IS NOT NECESSARY                            TO PROTECT THE INTERESTS OF COASTAL STATES AND THAT LDC COMMITTEE I INTERESTS SHOULD NOT BE                            SACRIFICED IN A HURRIED EFFORT TO PRESERVE THE CHANCE OF CONCLUDING A                            COMPREHENSIVE TREATY A BELIEF THAT PERHAPS HAS ALWAYS BEEN PRESENT OR                            PERHAPS HAS BEEN STRENGTHENED BY THE ENACTMENT OF THE 200MILE FISHERIES                            LAW ALTERNATIVELY THERE IS SOME POSSIBILITY THAT LDC COASTAL STATES SUCH AS MEXICO ARE USING                            HARDLINE POSITIONS IN COMMITTEE I AS BARGAINING TACTICS TO PRESSURE US                            CONCESSIONS ON ECONOMIC ZONE ISSUES IN COMMITTEES II AND III CLEARLY A                            RELATIONSHIP HAS ALWAYS EXISTED BETWEEN PROGRESS IN COMMITTEES II AND                            III AND COMMITTEE I BUT IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO PREDICT WHICH IS GOVERNING                            WHICH AND INDEED IT DIFFERS FROM COUNTRY TO COUNTRY AN LDC WILLINGNESS TO DELAY COULD ALSO                            ARISE FROM A BASIC CONVICTION THAT THEY CAN AFFORD TO WAIT OUT THE                            UNITED STATES IN THIS NEGOTIATION BECAUSE WE WILL NEVER ADOPT UNILATERAL                            STEPS TO PROTECT OUR DEEP SEABED INTERESTS WE UNDERSTAND THIS VIEW WAS                            WIDELY ADVOCATED AT THE SELECT LDC                            MEETING CONVENED BY JAGOTA INDIA IN REACTION TO THE KISSINGER VISIT IF THIS CONVENTION IS                            WIDELY SHARED AMONG THIRD WORLD NATIONS THE PERCEPTION MUST BE THAT                            THERE IS NO ADVANTAGE TO THE GROUP OF 77S MAKING COMPROMISES IN                            COMMITTEE I AND THAT TIME IS CLEARLY ON THEIR SIDE AND WORKING AGAINST                            THE INTERESTS OF THE UNITED STATES PROGRESS MAY HAVE BEEN ELUSIVE AT THIS SESSION SIMPLY BECAUSE OF GROUP                            DYNAMICS AND PSYCHOLOGY AFFECTING THE GROUP OF 77 IT MAY BE INHERENT IN                            MULTILATERAL NEGOTIATIONS AT THIS TIME THAT THE GROUP OF 77 RESPONDS TO                            MOB PSYCHOLOGY AND THAT EFFECTIVE NEGOTIATION MANAGEMENT IS UNACHIEVABLE                            EITHER BECAUSE OF SHEER SIZE OR IDEOLOGICAL DISPARITIES WE MAY BE WITNESSING AT THIS CONFERENCE THE EFFECTS OF RECENT LDC SOLIDARITY AND SUCCESSES GAINED IN OTHER                            INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC FORUMS SUCH AS UNCTAD IV THE LEADERSHIP OF THE GROUP OF 7 IS MAKING                            VIGOROUS EFFORTS TO CONSOLIDATE THE GROUP AT A VERY HIGH LEVEL AGAINST                            ANY LOSS OF SOLIDARITY TO THIS END THE G77 IS CURRENTLY HOLDING A MINISTERIALLEVEL CONFERENCE IN                            MEXICO CITY ONE OF WHOSE LIKELY OUTCOMES WILL BE ENDORSEMENT OF A                            SUMMITLEVEL G77 CONFERENCE NEXT YEAR TO                            PUT CHIEF EXECUTIVE IMPRIMATUR ON FUTURE G77 MINISTERIALLEVEL DECISIONS WE HAVE ALSO NOTED IN THE PAST THAT THE EXTREMISTS LEADERSHIP IN THE                            GROUP OF 77 IS FLUID AND THAT COOPTING ONE PARTICULARLY EFFECTIVE                                LDC SERVES NO PURPOSE SINCE OTHER                            ACTIVISTS WILL TAKE ITS PLACE THIS PHENOMENON IS EVIDENCED BY THE LOSS                            OF INFLUENCE BY LDC MEMBERS OF THE SECRET                            BRAZIL

EXTREMISTS IN FACT THEY ARE ESPOUSING THE MAINSTREAM OF LDC ECONOMIC IDEOLOGY IN INTERNATIONAL FORA                            THE REAL DISTINCTION AMONG THE MEMBERS OF THE GROUP OF 77 CONTINUES TO                            BE THEIR RESPECTIVE WILLINGNESS TO SACRIFICE IDEOLOGICAL PRINCIPALS IN                            AN ATTEMPT TO ACHIEVE A TREATY OF PRACTICAL VALUE WHAT WE ARE UNABLE TO                            ASSESS IS THE STRENGTH OF LDC COMMITMENT                            TO CONCLUDE A TREATY AND WHETHER THE POSITIONS TAKEN BY THE GROUP OF 77                            AT THIS SESSION ARE REPRESENTATIVE OF A GENERAL SUBSTANTIVE SHIFT IN                            THEIR VIEWS IF THE COMMITMENT DOES EXIST AND NO FUNDAMENTAL SUBSTANTIVE                            CHANGE HAS OCCURRED IT MAY BE POSSIBLE TO DEAL WITH AT LEAST SOME OF                            THE NUMEROUS PROBLEMS LISTED ABOVE ANY OF WHICH COULD BE CONTROLLING                            FACTORS IN FUTURE

INVOLVEMENT IN BANGLADESHS AFFAIRS WE REPORT THIS TO                            INDICATE IN BANGLADESHS AFFAIRS WE REPORT THIS TO INDICATE THAT MEHTA                            WHOM WE BELIEVE IS SEEKING TO IMPROVE RELATIONS WITH THE US STILL                            BELIEVES HE NEEDS HELP IN DEMONSTRATING US BONA FIDES IN BANGLADESH3 SHIFTING TO PAKISTAN MEHTA SPECULATED ABOUT PAKISTANS MOTIVES IN                            REGARD TO RECENT STATEMENTS CONCERNING KASHMIR HE WONDERED IF THEY WERE                            MADE FOR PUBLIC CONSUMPTION OR IF THEY REPRESENTED SOMETHING MORE                            SERIOUS IN ANY EVENT HE SAID ALTHOUGH INDIA HAS SO FAR REFRAINED FROM                            ANY COMMENT IT CANNOT DO SO INDEFINITELY DELHI IS A BIT NERVOUS ABOUT                            ITS SOMEWHAT SHAKY POLITICAL RELATIONS WITH SHEIKH ABDULLAH AT PRESENT                            AND MAY BE PARTICULARLY SENSITIVE TO BHUTTOS COMMENTS ABOUT KASHMIR IN                            THESE CIRCUMSTANCES THEN MEHTA ASKED RHETORICALLY IF SOME METHOD MIGHT                            NOT BE FOUND BY WHICH THE ANXIETIES OF THE SUBCONTINENT COULD BE                            ASSUAGED4 MEHTA TOOK HIS ANALYSIS OF THE PAKISTAN PROBLEM SOMEWHAT FARTHER WHEN                            SPEAKING TO MANTEL HE DESCRIBED THE REMARKABLE ACHIEVEMENTS OF THE                            RECENT AGREEMENT WITH PAKISTAN AND ITS RAPID IMPLEMENTATION BUT AGAIN                            DESCRIBED RECENT STATEMENTS IN PAKISTAN ABOUT KASHMIR WHICH HE SAID                            RAISED QUESTIONS ABOUT PROSPECTS OF THE FUTURE IT WAS AT THIS POINT                            THAT HE MADE HIS ONLY COMMENT ON US MILITARY SALES TO PAKISTAN HE SAID                            THAT THE SALE OF SOME OFFENSIVE WEAPON SUCH AS THE A7 COULD START THE                            CYCLE OF INDIAPAKISTAN ACTIONS AND REACTIONS GOING AGAIN AND WOULD                            HAVE POLITICAL SIGNIFICANCE BY THE LATTER HE MEANT IT WOULD BE                            CONSIDERED BY THE PAKISTANIS AS ALSO THE INDIANS AS INDICATING THEY                            HAD THE POLITICAL SUPPORT OF THE US IT WOULD MEHTA SAID DAMAGE BOTH                            INDIAPAKISTANI RELATIONS AND INDIAUS RELATIONS IT SEEMS TO US                            SIGNIFICANT THAT DESPITE THE FACT THAT MANTEL STARTED THE CONVERSATION                            BY DESCRIBING HIS SPECIFIC INTEREST IN THE MILITARY SALES PROGRAM MEHTA                            OFFERED ONLY THIS SINGLE COMMENT ON US SALES5 THE NEXT DAY TEJA WAS SOMEWHAT MORE SPECIFIC REGARDING US MILITARY                            SALES BUT STILL RESTRAINED IF US ARMS SUPPLY TO PAKISTAN IS OF                            SUFFICIENT QUANTITY TO HAVE POLITICAL IMPACT HE SAID IT WILL CAUSE CONCERNS IN INDIA HE                            MENTIONED SPECIFICALLY A7S OR TANKS HE RECOGNIZED HOWEVER THAT THE                            US HAD GONE SLOW IN SALES IN RECENT YEARS HE ALSO NOTED THAT SO FAR THE                            US WAS OFFERING ARMS ONLY FOR CASH SALE TEJA ALSO MENTIONED THE                            REEMERGENCE OF KASHMIR ISSUE IN PAKISTAN MAKING CLEAR THAT HIS CONCERN                            ABOUT THE POLITICAL IMPACT OF US ARMS SALES RELATED TO SUCH THINGS AS                            PAKISTANS ATTITUDE TOWARD NEGOTIATIONS WITH INDIA THE EXPLAINED THAT                            US SALES HAD INDEED BEEN MODEST AND SAID THAT MANY PEOPLE QUESTIONED WHY                            INDIA WAS CONCERNED ABOUT US SALES WHEN IT HAD SUCH EXTENSIVE FOREIGN                            SOURCES ITSELF AND WAS CLEARLY MILITARILY SUPERIOR TEJA DID NOT PRESS                            THE ISSUE PERHAPS BECAUSE AS HE HAD PREVIOUSLY TOLD MANTEL THE GOI DID NOT WISH TO MAKE USPAKISTAN                            RELATIONS THE PRINCIPAL DETERMINANT OF USINDIA RELATIONS6 THESE DISCUSSIONS LEAD US TO SEVERAL TENTATIVE CONCLUSIONS FIRST IT                            IS OBVIOUS THAT THERE ARE THOSE HIGH IN THE GOI WHO CONTINUE TO BELIEVE                            THAT THE US IS OPERATING AGAINST INDIAS INTEREST IN BOTH BANGLADESH AND                            PAKISTAN AND THERE ARE THOSE SUCH AS THE FOREIGN SECRETARY WHO WOULD                            LIKE TO BE ABLE TO PROVE THEM WRONG SECOND IT SEEMS CLEAR THAT                            TACTICALLY AT LEAST THE GOI HAS BEEN                            HANDLING THE ARMS ISSUE QUITE DIFFERENTLY FROM IN THE PAST IT HAS NOT                            COMPLAINED ABOUT MODEST SALES AND INDEED HAS NOT YET MADE AN ISSUE                            WITH US IN DELHI OF THOSE SALES WHICH ARE NOW BEFORE THE SENATE                            COMMITTEE THIRD IT IS CLEAR HOWEVER THAT THE GOI SEES A LIMIT TO ITS RESTRAINT AND THE A7 EXCEEDS THAT                            LIMIT MANTEL WAS TOLD BY THE MEA PLANNING JOINT SECRETARY DAMODARAN                            THAT INDIA DID NOT SEE AN A7 TRADE OFF FOR REPROCESSING FACILITIES AS                            ACCEPTABLE IN ANY WAY THERE ALSO SEEMS TO BE A MUCH MORE VAGUELY                            DEFINED LIMIT WHICH IS THAT QUANTITY OF ARMS SALES WHICH THE INDIANS SEE                            AS AFFECTING PAKISTANS STANCE REGARDING INDIA IN THIS REGARD INDIAN                            OFFICIALS HAVE MADE IT CLEAR: THAT OTHER FACTORS SUCH AS TIMING AND THE                            STATE OF USINDIA RELATIONS WOULD HAVE AN EFFECT ON THEIR REACTION TO US                            ARMS SALES IF USINDIA RELATIONS WERE WARM AND A US ARMS SALE TO                            PAKISTAN WAS NOT MADE AT A TIME OF INDIAPAKISTAN DIFFICULTY INDIA                            MIGHT NOT BE CONCERNED ABOUT IT7 WE DONT WANT TO EXAGGERATE THE IMPORTANCE OF THIS DIALOGUE WHICH IN                            SOME REGARD RESEMBLES THAT WHICH HAS TAKEN PLACE OVER THE YEARS AND                            WHICH WE OFTEN WOULD PREFER TO FORGET WE DID NOTE HOWEVER A TOUCH OF                            RESTRAINT AND A SUSPICION OF A SLIGHTLY MORE TOLERANT ATTITUDE                            THROUGHOUT MANTELS NUMEROUS MEETINGS IN DELHI THIS MAY REPRESENT                            CHANGE OR BETTER TACTICS OR SIMPLY THE VIEWS OF INTELLIGENT INDIANS                            DURING

          PLANNING SOVIET AFFAIRS AND EVEN PAKISTAN AND THE DIRECTOR OF THE                            INSTITUTE FOR DEF STUDIES AND ANALYSIS TOLD MANTEL THAT WHILE THEY DID                            NOT NECESSARILY AGREE WITH ITS ARMS PURCHASES NEITHER WERE THEY                            CONCERNED AS A POTENTIAL ARMS SUPPLIER TO PAKISTAN THE MEA JOINT                            SECRETARY FOR SOVIET AFFAIRS REMARKED THAT THE RUSSIANS HAD REPEATEDLY                            URGED THE DANGER OF THE ARMS BUILDUP IN IRAN TO INDIA IN CONVERSATIONS                            WITH GOI OFFICIALS AND HAD BEEN POLITELY TOLD THAT THE INDIANS WERE NOT                            CONCERNED SINCE THEIR RELATIONS WITH IRAN WERE NOW EXCELLENT EVEN                            ASSUMING AN ELEMENT OF DISINGENUOUSNESS WITH THIS ARGUMENT IT IS AT LEAST EVIDENT THAT INDIA                            IS NOT PREPARED TO EXPRESS ANY COMPLAINT ABOUT IRANIAN PURCHASES TO THE                            US
