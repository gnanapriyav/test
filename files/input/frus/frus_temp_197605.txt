Shah Comments on Oil                        Prices1 At conclusion of audience evening of May 15 Shah commented that                        Administrator Zarbs visit to Tehran                        was a washoutZarb visited Tehran May 710 The Embassy transmitted a                            full record of Zarbs meetings                            with various Iranian officials in telegrams 4694 and 4770 from Tehran                            May 10 and 11 Both ibid D7601790725 and D7601810440 Before                        I had a chance to reply the Shah continued We are not a colony When I                        asked what he meant by that remark the Shah replied Mr Zarbs offer to Ansary was so ridiculous that he must think that Iran is a                        colony of the United StatesAccording to                            telegram 105198 to Tehran May 1 the FEAs Strategic Petroleum Reserve purchase plan required                            foreign suppliers to deliver crude oil in US flag vessels to salt                            domes in the US Gulf coast area at a total price of 11 per barrel a                            discount of over 4 per barrel on Iranian prices Ibid                            D7601680074 After I had forcefully remonstrated the Shah                        ceased putting me on his tone of voice changed and he became more                        reasonable He stated You know very well that it is inevitable that the                        price of crude oil will rise if not in the next couple of months then later                        on You remember that we sold some oil to independent companies a couple of                        years ago for 35 a barrel Obviously this was an extreme and unusual situation but even so I would think                        that the price of oil would eventually rise to 25 Incidentally I have                        been doing some figuring and I am willing to wager that your Alaska oil                        delivered to a refinery in the United States will cost 16 per barrel The                        Shah then noted that the United States seems to have forgotten about the                        energy crisis and the American public has gone back to a businessasusual                        life style He commented Only the price of oil is going to oblige your                        country to seek alternative sources of energyIn telegram 5497 from Tehran May 31 the Embassy noted that the                            Iranian delegation at the OPEC meeting                            in Bali May 2728 agreed to postpone oil price hikes until March 1977                            reportedly due to the Shahs reluctance to disturb Washington prior to                            the US election Ford Library National Security Adviser NSC Middle East and South Asian Affairs                            Staff Box 5 Country File Iran 7 In a June 3 note to Kissinger Atherton pointed out that Iran was                            motivated more by Saudi opposition to an increase King Khalids                            presence in Tehran and the weak demand for heavy crudes National

                         72 At this juncture I had an opportunity to make the point that I regarded                        Mr Zarbs visit to Iran as a most                        useful one I explained to the Shah why I felt this to be so including the                        fact that it had provided an opportunity for Mr Zarb to explain to Minister Amouzegar and other Iranian officials what US policy on oil                        conservation and alternative sources now is The Shah snapped back Do you                        have a coherent energy policy I then went over in some detail what Mr                            Zarb had had to say here about                        conservation and about work being done in the United States on other sources                        of energy3 Comment: I have put much of the foregoing in direct                        quotes in order to convey the flavor of the Shahs reactions These should                        not be taken personally by Mr Zarb                        or any other USG official The Shah fights                        hard for his point of view but his rhetoric should not be overread any more                        than he overreads public statements of US officials opposing his oil                        policies4 Commenting on recent gas finds in Iran the Shah noted that almost every                        well that has recently been drilled whether on land or in the water has                        demonstrated the presence of quantities of gas The Shah now estimates that                        Iran may have as much gas as the Soviet Union or even more This led to a                        discussion of the NIOCDistrigasEl Paso                            LNG project The Shah ruminated as to                        why it was taking El Paso so long to work out the necessary arrangements He                        noted delays caused by debate over pipeline vs the Suez Canal route then                        over the rate which the Egyptians would charge for use of the canal He                        expressed concern re anticipated delays when time comes to obtain rulings of

had vetoed the foreign assistance bill which                            required the disestablishment of certain MAAGs by September 1976 and the                            rest by 1977 unless

subject of a letter to Senator Humphey                            on the foreign assistance bill is in the National Archives RG 59 Central Foreign Policy Files                            D75043008261 Elimination or sharp reduction in size of US security assistance                        elements in Iran would effectively nullify present Iranian plans for                        military modernization seriously damage US political economic                        commercial and military relations with Iran and critically weaken US                            strategic position in this                        region It is difficult to conceive a more harmful action that US could                        take against Iran or against our own overall interests here Urge that                        highest priority be assigned to retention of US security assistance group                        in Iran at current manning levels2 As we see it there are three powerful factors in support of this                        recommendation:A US military ties to Iran have longer and more stable history than is                        case with most other countries including most NATO members Since World War II US has provided most of                        equipment and technical advice for Iranian armed services Our performance                        has been excellent and in consequence we are trusted as is no other                        country with a military link to Iran Over past three decades our behavior                        and effective working relationship with Iran rather than any formal                        agreements or assurances of our leaders have created a commitment that is                        heavily relied upon in this country Although Iranians may not now expect us                        to exercise kind of influence we used with USSR during Azerbaijan crisis they do expect us to continue to                        help them help themselves to defend their own and Western interests in this                        region They do not expect from us shoddy treatment Soviets have given their                        friends such as Egypt and IndonesiaB More than any other country of comparable size or importance Iranian                        sovereign is de facto commanderinchief of his nations armed services The                        Shah personally makes decisions on major weapons systems procurement and                        management of his military establishment He relies heavily on US advice                        and continued good performance Were we to back off in significant way from                        Shahs level of expectations we could expect his reaction to be personal                        and forcefulC During past four years we have signed more orders for military goods and                        services with Iran than with any other country Only about 25 percent of                        ordered equipment has been delivered to date and next few years will see                        arrival of bulk of hardware and rigorous testing of Iranian absorptive                        capacity Implied in our willingness to sell this equipment has been                        understanding that we would stand behind it with training logistics and                        management support Included on Iranian order list are some of our most                        sophisticated weapons systems such as F14 Spruance ships and IHawk Putting these systems to effective use                        in Iranian armed forces which have limited managerial and technically                        skilled personnel will severely strain Iranian capabilities In fact it is                        clear that without outside assistance effective use cannot be made of most                        complex weapons systems Although heavy reliance is placed on services of                        civilian contractor personnel role of official US DOD personnel is crucial in providing overall                        management assistance and advice to GOI In                        Iranian Air Force logistics system is integrated with USAF supply sources Similar supply linkages                        exist with IIGF helicopters and new naval system Termination                        of US military role would reduce Iranian logistics networks to chaos3 Should we not be able to avoid Congressional limitations on our military                        presence in Iran as outlined in current legislation we foresee following                        possible consequences:A Cancellation of number of major military weapons systems procurement                        actions with US and probable refusal of GOI to settle on our termsB Sharp reduction or cancellation of orders from US firms in civilian                        sectorC Politicaleconomic actions against USG                        interests including conceivable association with any future Arab oil                        embargo less cooperative posture on regional UN and other international                        matters and complete loss of leverage over iranian transfers of weapons to                        third countriesD Growth of selfishly motivated civilian defense contractor influence in                        Iran without countervailing USG voice As                            GOI would be subject to heavy                        contractor pressures absence of any meaningful military presence here would                        require that we respond to Iranian requests or initiatives with legislation                        or other equally blunt instruments eg denial of certain sales rather                        than persuasionE 4 lines not declassifiedF Repercussions throughout region if US were to treat with so little                        consideration a faithful ally which has in fact taken no action against                        US interests unless one wants to mention oil prices nor in any way                        worked against US policy No country in this region could feel secure in                        its relationship with US Soviet influence now at relatively low ebb                        would grow apace4 In summary our inability to overcome Congressional strictures on military                        presence in Iran would be disastrous5 We believe that manning levels should be continued at roughly current                        level Presently we have 209 US positions assigned to MAAG 728 technicians under TAFT contract 438 support personnel                        including TAFT component and 128 other                        security assistance personnel Total of 1500 personnel should be adequate                        for next 23 years There will be fluctuations up and down as some                        technicians finish their work on projects and others begin new tasks All                        but 8 MAAG spaces and 7080 percent of                        other elements will be funded by GOI in                            FY 77 a small increase in GOI support over FY 76 financing As our military presently is organized                        according to historical rather than rational principles some reorganization                        within numbers allotted is planned in near future6 There are no rpt no satisfactory                        alternatives to present DOD manning levels                        in Iran We see no point in erecting alternative straw men eg contractor or third country                        substitution only to knock them down To extent that DOD numbers are cut back we would suffer some                        of effects listed in para 3 above7 DefRep Chief ARMISHMAAG and I                        have been engaged in effort to restrict number of personnel to lowest level

                     first proposed an International Energy Institute to study the                            availability of energy resources especially in nonoilproducing

should now proceed with those representations2 Background Analysis The nonconfrontational atmosphere generated by your                        speech in Nairobi has enhanced the possibility of moderation by the cartel                        in its deliberations on prices On economic grounds alone the cartel might                        have trouble with an increase because of the drop in demand for heavy crude                        and the problem that it has with price differentials All these factors will                        tend to support the OPEC moderatesSaudi                        Arabia Kuwait and the Emirateswho are opposed to an increase at this                        timeA We have already made clear our view that new price increases are not                        warranted In April in the CIEC Energy                        Commission we put forward a strong analytical case against high oil prices                        emphasizing the particularly severe impact further rises would have on                        nonoil LDCsAccording to the Mission to the                                OECDs summary of the first 2 days                            of the April round of the CIEC the                            United States tabled a paper in the Energy Commission which argued                            essentially that world is in transition from economy based mainly on                            oilproduced energy to economy based on other forms this transition                            should be smooth not based on crisis atmosphere sufficient fossil                            fuels are available to bridge the transition danger exists that too                            rapid concentration on expensive alternatives could lead to serious                            misallocation of resources and that oil prices should be at level which                            encourages economically efficient use of resources and smooth transition                            to alternatives The G19s response to this paper was highly                            critical Telegram 12032 from USOECD Paris April 23 National Archives RG 59

                    sure what line OPEC would take but                            that Iran would probably occupy its traditional position between the                            price extremists and the price moderates Telegram 4694 from Tehran                            May 10 ibid D7601790725B On the other hand OPEC has clearly                        sought in the CIEC Energy Commission to                        lay the basis for justifying an increase in oil prices More recent reports                        also indicate that OPECs Economic                        Commission Board has prepared studies purporting to show that import prices                        from industrialized countries have increased 154 percent over the past nine                        months thus further buttressing the case for an increase Finally it is                        clear that some of the producers such as the Iranians and Indonesians are                        determined to press for an increase3 OptionsA Instruct our Ambassadors in key OPEC                        capitals to make discreet nonconfrontational representations pitched to                        the circumstances and views of each OPEC                        government A suggested cable is at Tab AThe                            draft instruction to Embassies in OPEC                            capitals is in

of OPEC imports                        from industrialized countries has gone up only 272 percent instead of 154                        percent as alleged by OPECs experts over                        the past nine months We could thus further strengthen the hands of the                            OPEC moderates In the capitals of the                            hardliners we would stress                        our mutual interest in maintaining the present constructive atmosphere in                        improving economic stability and in expanding world demand If done without                        being abrasive and confrontational it could do some goodMore importantly domestic political considerations require that we do all                        we can to influence the OPEC decision                        DepSec Robinson will testify before                        Senator Kennedys Energy Subcommittee on June 8 This will probably be just                        after the outcome of the OPEC price                        deliberations become known If we are confronted with a price increase it                        would not be enough to respond to Congress and to the American people that                        we made our case on oil prices in the CIEC                        and that Frank Zarb raised the                        question during his recent Middle East swing Ambassadorial representations                        would enable us to say that we had gone directly to producer governments                        with our case at a crucial timeCons:If the producers decide to continue the freeze or to raise prices only                        slightly for any of several reasons including market conditions they                        could nevertheless contend that they acted in compliance to our dmarches                        and that we should in turn make concessions in other areas eg                        commodities This could make our dealings with NorthSouth economic issues                        in CIEC and elsewhere more difficultOur position against further price increases is well known to key OPEC countries through intensive discussions                        and analysis at the April CIEC Energy                        Commission If additional action is needed we could reemphasize our                        position unilaterally in a public statement option B belowA further dmarche at this stage is unlikely to change the position of any                            OPEC government Moreover it will                        make us look like mendicants and provide another opportunity for OPEC members to lecture us on the rationale                        for a possible increaseIf OPEC raises prices despite our                        dmarches we demonstrate our impotence on oil price issues which serves                        neither our domestic political nor international interestsOption B: Issue a public statement prior to the Bali meeting that makes the                        strong economic case against new price increases This statement would                        stress that the prices of OPEC imports                        have risen less than three percent since the October price hike of 10                        percent that further increases would endanger the fragile economic recovery                        that is beginning to be widespread and that market conditions do not                        warrant higher prices A draft statement for your consideration is at Tab

                  case against new price increasesWith this statement our price arguments in CIEC in April and the recent Zarb trip we can demonstrate to the Congress and public that                        we made an effort to influence the OPEC                        price decisionThe public statement could challenge the credibility of the study of the                            OPEC Economic Commission Board and                        provide ammunition for the use of the Saudis and other OPEC moderates at Bali as well as                        dmarchesShould OPEC continue the oil price freeze                        the producers could not assert that it was in compliance to our bilateral                        dmarches thus requiring concessions on our side They will in any event                        insist in CIEC and elsewhere that the                        industrialized nations must take action to match their contribution to                        global warfareCons:Would not take advantage of personal influence that our Ambassadors might be                        able to exert on key officials in producers capitalsIf producers raise prices despite our efforts it would publicly demonstrate                        our inability to influence pricing decisionsOur statement would probably be characterized by some producers as                        unwarranted interference in OPEC affairs                        perhaps making it more difficult for the moderates to oppose price                        increasesOption C: To make dmarches in OPEC                        capitals and issue a public statement ie options A  BPros:Will doubly emphasize our opposition to oil price increases and show                        Congress we pulled out all the stops to influence the OPEC decisionWill give two opportunities to take issue with the OPEC Economic Commission Boards studyCons:Same as all cons for option ASame as second and third cons for option BMay be

IN THIS DIRECTION IN ONE YEAR WOULD BE TOO                            MUCH TO EXPECT TN VIEW OF THE NATURE AND ENORMOUS SIZE OF THE PROBLEMS                            THEMSELVES HOWEVER OTHER FACTORS

MUCH NEEDED STEPS TO REFORM INDIAS CIVIL BUREAUCRACY WHOSE                            STYLE AND ORGANIZATION HAS NOT ESSENTIALLY CHANGED SINCE INDEPENDENCE                            ALTHOUGH GIVEN GOOD MARKS IN COMPARISON WITH CIVIL SERVICES IN OTHER                            DEVELOPING COUNTRIES IT REMAINS AN INADEQUATE CATALYTIC AGENT IN                            IMPLEMENTING SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC CHANGES IT IS COMPETENT BUT THIN AT                            SENIOR LEVELS AND WOEFULLY UNDERSTAFFED AT LOCAL IMPLEMENTATION LEVELS                            WHERE DISTRICT COLLECTORS IN THEIR 30s ARE OFTEN CHARGED WITH                            ADMINISTRATING THREE TO TEN MILLION PEOPLE WITH A STAFF OF LESS THAN A                            DOZEN RESPONSIBLE SUBORDINATES LOCAL CORRUPTION IS WIDESPREAD AND                            CONTINUES WE BELIEVE TO ADVERSELY AFFECT DEVELOPMENT EFFORTS EVEN IF                            IT MAY HAVE BEEN CURBED SOMEWHAT SINCE THE EMERGENCY HIGH LEVEL                            CORRUPTION AND EXTORTION FOR POLITICAL PURPOSES IS UNCHANGED AND CLEARLY                            SANCTIONED FROM THE VERY TOP OF THE SYSTEM13 THE

ECONOMIC SECTOR THE MACROECONOMIC INDICATORS SHOULD CONTINUE TO MOVE                            UPWARD BUT AT A SLOW PACE LACK OF SPEEDY PROGRESS IS AS MUCH A PRODUCT                            OF THE PAST LOPSIDED EMPHASIS ON HEAVY INDUSTRIALIZATION garbled text                            in original LABOR TRANQUILITY PRODUCED BY THE EMERGENCY WILL FACILITATE                            INCREASED PRODUCTION THE RECENT INDICATION OF INTENSIFIED GOI CONCERN                            ABOUT INDIAS DEMOGRAPHIC NIGHTMARE IS ONE OF THE FIRST SIGNALS THAT THE                            FULL RESOURCES OF THE STATE MAY BE PUT BEHIND AN EFFORT TO ACHIEVE                            SIGNIFICANT RESULTS IN THIS VITAL AREA IF SO IT MAY ONLY BE POSSIBLE                            IF THE EMERGENCY CONTINUES AND ADEQUATE ADMINISTRATIVE MACHINERY CAN BE                            DEVELOPED IN A SHORT TIME EVEN THEN THE PROGRAMS COULD ULTIMATELY                            AROUSE DEEP AND STRIDENT

        ADMINISTRATIVE AND SOCIETAL PROBLEMS WILL REMAIN POOR15 THE QUESTION OF THE SUCCESSION: THIS ANALYSIS IS PREDICATED ON THE                            ASSUMPTION THAT MRS GANDHIS                            POSITION AS INDIAS PRIME MINISTER IS SECURE FOR THE SHORTRUN AT LEAST                            INDEED SO FAR AS WE KNOW SHE IS IN GOOD HEALTH AT AGE 58 AND COULD GO                            ON FOR ANOTHER GENERATION AS HER SON SANJAY MATURES SHE MAY FEEL HE IS                            READY TO MOVE INTO HER POSITION TEN YEARS HE WILL BE 40 OR MORE HENCE                            AND MAY CONSIDER WITHDRAWING IN HIS FAVOR BUT THE SUCCESSION COULD                            FOLLOW A DIFFERENT PATTERN SHOULD SHE DIE SOONERAND SUDDENLY WE                            BELIEVE THAT THAT THE PRESENT SANJAYLED INNER CIRCLE AROUND THE PRIME                            MINSTER IS ALREADY WORKING TO POSITION ITSELF TO CAPTURE THE PRIME                            MINISTERSHIP IN THE EVENT OF MRS GANDHIS SUDDEN DEATH BUT WE DO NOT WRITE OFF THE                            POSSIBILITY THAT IN THESE CIRCUMSTANCES CURRENTLY MORIBUND POLITICIANS                            WILL REVIVE THEMSELVES AND ATTEMPT TO OUTMANEUVER THE INNER CIRCLE AND                            SECURE THE SELECTION OF AN ALTERNATIVE CANDIDATE THE RESULTING                            POLITICAL FRAY COULD CONCEIVABLY LEAD TO SPLITS IN THE CONGRESS OF NOT                            TO ITS OUTRIGHT DISINTEGRATION AND TO VIOLENCE TENSIONS AND PRESSURES                            FROM REGIONAL POLITICIANS COULD ADD TO A GENERAL UNCERTAINTY THE INNER                            CIRCLE COULD ATTEMPT TO USE THEIR SYMPATHIZERS IN THE INTELLIGENCE AND                            SECURITY SERVICES AND THE DELHI ADMINISTRATION TO ESTABLISH THEIR CLAIM                            AND IN THESE CIRCUMSTANCES THE ROLE OF THE PRESIDENT AND THE ARMY COULD                            BE CRUCIAL IF THE INNER CIRCLE SHOULD SUCCEED IN CAPTURING THE PRIME                            MINISTERSHIP THE LIKELIHOOD OF SHARPLY ENHANCED AUTHORITARIANISM IN                            INDIA WOULD INCREASE

CONVINCING ONE POSSIBLE EXCEPTION                            WOULD BE THE NAMING OF A CURRENT CABINET MEMBER OR LDP FACTION LEADER IN CONNECTION WITH                            LOCKHEED BRIBES THERE ARE ALSO IMPORTANT FACTORS WHICH WORK IN FAVOR                            OF MIKIS CONTINUANCE IN                            OFFICE NO ONE WANTS HIS JOB UNTIL LOCKHEED IS SOMEHOW RESOLVED HE IS                            IN POSITION TO ORCHESTRATE THE IMPACT OF LOCKHEED DISCLOSURES AND HIS                            CLEAN IMAGE IS LIKELY TO BE MORE IMPORTANT THAN EVER TO CONSERVATIVES                            IN THE WAKE OF LOCKHEED THE MEDIA STILL BY AND LARGE SUPPORTS                                MIKI AND THERE IS NO                            INDICATION THAT FUKUDA                            HAS THE STOMACH FOR AN OPEN SHOWDOWN WITH MIKI  AND THAT MAY WELL BE                            CRUCIAL FINALLY MIKI HAS                            SHOWN HIMSELF TO HAVE UNUSUAL TENACITY AND SKILL AS A POLITICAL                            INFIGHTER IN ADDITION TO HIS ADVANTAGES AS INCUMBENT THUS WHILE                                MIKI IS NOW VULNERABLE                            AND HIS REPLACEMENT BY FUKUDA COULD COME SUDDENLY WE BELIEVE HIS CHANCES ARE                            BETTER THAN EVER OF SURVIVING UNTIL THE LOWER HOUSE ELECTIONNOW WIDELY                            EXPECTED IN THE FALL AND IF THE LDP                            PERFORMS REASONABLY WELL FOR SOMETIME BEYOND END SUMMARY1 IT WAS A POWER STANDOFF WITHIN THE RULING CONSERVATIVE PARTY LDP WHICH FIRST BROUGHT PRIMINMIKI TO POWER MORE THAN                            ANY OTHER FACTOR IT WAS THAT SAME ROUGH EQUILIBRIUM BETWEEN DEPUTY                                PRIMINFUKUDAS FORCES ON THE                            ONE HAND AND FORMER PRIMINTANAKAS FORCES                            SUPPORTING FINMIN OHIRA ON THE OTHER THAT HAS ASSURED MIKIS CONTINUANCE IN POWER EACH                            SIDE HAS FRUSTRATED THE STRATEGIES OF THE OTHER AS THEY SOUGHT IN                            DIFFERENT WAYS AND AT DIFFERENT TIMES TO TOPPLE MIKI THE CONTINUING STALEMATE                            ALSO FOCUSED ATTENTION ON A HANDFUL OF OLDER COMPROMISE CANDIDATES                            EG SHIINA AS POSSIBLE MIKI SUCCESSORS IT ALSO GAVE RISE TO RECURRENT                            POTENTIAL CRISES OF THE MIKI ADMINISTRATION WHICH IN RETROSPECT MIKI ALWAYS SURVIVED WITH                            REMARKABLE EASE IN SHORT IT WAS THIS STANDOFF WHICH IN THE JAPANESE                            PHRASE HAS PROVIDED MIKIS                            STABILITY BASED ON INSTABILITY2 BUT THE POLITICAL DYNAMICS WITHIN THE LDP ARE NOW CHANGING: THE STANDOFF IS CRUMBLING EARLY THIS                            YEAR TANAKAS POWER WAS                            CLEARLY RISING AND FUKUDAS PRIME MINISTERIAL PROSPECTS APPEARED DIM INDEED                            BUT THREE MONTHS AGO THE UNEXPECTED ERUPTION OF THE LOCKHEED AFFAIR HERE                            REVERSED THE TABLES THE EARLY APPEARANCE OF TANAKAINTIMATE KENJI OSANOS                            NAME THE STILL UNANSWERED QUESTIONS SURROUNDING TANAKAS FINANCES WHICH                            OCCASIONED HIS 1974 FALL FROM POWER AND THE FACT THAT TANAKA AND TANAKA MEN WHEREIN POWER AT                            THE TIME OF THE TRISTAR DECISION ALL COMBINED TO CONCENTRATE SUSPICION                             SOME WOULD SAY CERTAIN KNOWLEDGE  QUESTION HAS BEEN ONLY WHETHER                            THEY WOULD BE CAUGHT THIS TIME BUT WHETHER OR NOT THESE SUSPICIONS                            ARE JUSTIFIED THEIR WIDESPREAD CURRENCY AND RESULTING POLITICAL EFFECT                            HAVE UNEXPECTEDLY AND DRAMATICALLY ALTERED TANAKAS INFLUENCE WITHIN THE                                LDP DURING THE PAST THREE MONTHS                            THIS IN TURN HAS PROFOUNDLY CHANGED CONSERVATIVE DYNAMICS WITH THESE                            IMPORTANT RESULTS:FUKUDA IS NOW WIDELY                            VIEWED THROUGHOUT THE LDP AND BUSINESS                            COMMUNITY AS THE ALMOST CERTAIN SUCCESSOR TO PRIMINMIKI IN ADDITION WE WERE                            TOLD BY A FUKUDAINTIMATE                            THAT FUKUDA IS NOW                            THINKING OF THE TONE TO SET FOR HIS ADMINISTRATION AND TALKING                            CABINET PERSONNEL LIKE A PRIME MINISTER  THIS FOR THE FIRST TIME TO                            OUR KNOWLEDGE AFTER MONTHS OF FALSE RUMORS OHIRA APPEARS NOW TO BE MOVING TOWARD SUPPORT OF THE                                FUKUDA CANDIDACY THE                            DIET SECRETARY OF ONE OF THE PRINCIPALS INVOLVED TOLD US THAT THE FIRST

                               OHIRA WANT TO                            COMMIT DOUBLE SUICIDE WITH TANAKA THE CANDIDACIES OF SENIOR LDP POLITICOS                            ACCEPTABLE TO BOTH FUKUDA                            AND TANAKA SUCH AS                            SHIINA HORI MAEO ET AL  BADLY FLAWED IN ANY EVENT  ARE NOW NO                            LONGER MATTERS OF SERIOUS DISCUSSION MOST EXPECT THESE MEN TO DRIFT                            TOWARD FUKUDA SOONER OR                            LATERAND AS THE DEPARTMENT IS AWARE FROM OTHER SOURCES TANKA HIMSELF IS                            REPORTED TO HAVE BOWED TO A FUKUDA CANDIDACY WE HAVE ALSO INDIRECTLY CONFIRMED                            THIS IT MAKES GOOD SENSE OF COURSE FOR TANAKA TO USE HIS RAPIDLY                            WANING INFLUENCE TO HELP HIS FRIENDS EG OHIRA  AND PROTECT                            HIMSELFTHE UPSHOT OF ALL THIS IS THAT MIKI IS NOW VULNERABLE IN A NEW AND FUNDAMENTAL WAY3 THERE IS NO AGREEMENT HOWEVER ON THE CRUCIAL QUESTIONS OF WHEN AND                            HOW MIKI MIGHT BE OUSTED                            THOSE CLOSE TO FUKUDA NOW                            SAY THE FUNDAMENTAL ISSUE IS WHETHER MIKI SHOULD BE REPLACED BY THEIR MAN BEFORE OR AFTER THE                            LOWER HOUSE ELECTION THERE ARE MANY WHO FEEL IT SHOULD DEFINITELY BE                            BEFORE AND SOME EVEN EXPECT IT TO OCCUR WITHIN THE NEXT FEW WEEKS THEY                            POSIT SCENARIOS LIKE THESE:INEVITABLE  AND NECESSARY DISCLOSURE OF THE NAMES OF LOCKHEED CULPRITS                            EXPECTED IN LATE MAYEARLY JUNE WILL RESULT IN A CABINET CRISIS AND                                MIKIS                            DOWNFALLPOSSIBLE IN OUR VIEW ONLY IN THE UNLIKELY EVENT THAT A CURRENT                            CABINET MEMBER ANDOR LDP FACTION LEADER                            IS NAMES TO PROTEST ALMOST CERTAIN DIET FAILURE OF BUDGETRELATED

SAME CIRCUMSTANCES LAST YEAR HE DIDNT  AN EFFORT TO REPLACE LDP SECGEN                            NAKASONE NOW ALMOST UNIVERSALLY THOUGHT DESIRABLE WITHIN THE LDP WILL RESULT IN A CABINET CRISIS AND A

PARTY ELDERS CAN ON THE BASIS                            ON THE NEW POLITICAL CONSTELLATION FORCE MIKI TO RESIGN AT ANY TIME OF                            THEIR CHOOSING BUT IN THE ABSENCE OF STRONG MEDIA CRITICISM OR A LOST                            ELECTION IT IS DOUBTFUL WHETHER THE ELDERS NOW HAVE THIS POWERIF THEY                            EVER DID4 MOREOVER A NUMBER OF FACTORS CONTINUE TO

UNLIKELY TO SURFACE PUBLICLY                            BEFORE A LOCKHEED RESOLUTION SINCE FUKUDA REPORTEDLY FEARS POSSIBLE GUILT BY ASSOCIATION                            AND CLEMENCY REQUESTS FROM THE TANAKAOHIRA CAMP MORE THAN ANYONE ELSE MIKI                            IS IN POSITION TO ORCHESTRATE THE TIMING AND IMPACT OF LOCKHEED                            DISCLOSURES TO HIS ADVANTAGEASSUMING AS EVERYONE DOES THAT MIKI HIMSELF IS NOT INVOLVED HIS CLEAN IMAGE IS                            LIKELY TO BE MORE IMPORTANT THAN EVER TO CONSERVATIVES FACING AN                            ELECTION ON THE HEELS OF SCANDAL WE HAVE IT ONE GOOD AUTHORITY THAT                            EVEN LONGTIME MIKI CRITIC                                LDP EXECUTIVE COUNCIL CHAIRMAN NADAO                            BELIEVES MIKI MUST BE                            SUPPORTED UNTIL AFTER THE ELECTION IN THE PAST WIDESPREAD MEDIA CRITICISM HAS BEEN A CUSTOMARY PRELUDE TO                            OUSTER OF A PRIME MINISTER ALTHOUGH WE HAVE ONE HINT OF POSSIBLE                            CHANGE MIKI CONTINUES TO                            ENJOY SUBSTANTIAL MEDIA SUPPORTAN OPEN CHALLENGE MAY WELL BE NECESSARY TO OUST HIM FUKUDA HAS PERSISTENTLY REFUSED                            TO DO SO AND IT CAN BE ARGUES PLAUSIBLY THAT HE WILL CONTINUE TO SHY                            AWAY FINALLY THERE IS THE NOT INCONSIDERABLE POWER OF INCUMBENCY AND                                MIKIS DEMONSTRATED                            TENACITY AND REMARKABLE SKILL IN MANEUVERING AMONG HIS ENEMIES IN SUM                            WHILE CONDITIONS NOW EXIST FOR A SUCCESSFUL CHALLENGE TO MIKI THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT                            A CHALLENGE WILL BE SUCCESSFUL5 ALL OF THIS LEADS TO OUR ASSESSMENT THAT MIKIS CHANCES OF SURVIVING UNTIL                            THE LOWER HOUSE ELECTION  NOW WIDELY EXPECTED IN THE FALL  AR BETTER THAN EVEN AND IF HE MAKES IT THAT                            FAR A REASONABLE SUCCESSFUL LDP ELECTION                            PERFORMANCE IE MAINTAINING MORE OR LESS ITS PRESENT 274 SEATS WOULD                            GIVE MIKI A NEW AND                            SOMEWHAT LONGER LEASE ON POLITICAL LIFE BUT IT WONT BE EASY HE IS NOW                            A MARKED MAN VULNERABLE AS NEVER BEFORE AND HIS REPLACEMENT BY
