frus1969-76v27d307	307 Telegram From the Interests Section in Baghdad to the Department of State	None	1976-04-27 06:39:00	None	None	563 Subj: Problems in Implementation of Iraqs Openness Policy1 Summary:RCC has made high level decision to open up                        Iraq to Western commercial interests and has undertaken sustained drive to                        improve relations with neighbors through exchanges of Ambassadors numerous                        high level visits and a variety of other exchanges Working level of GOI however has not been geared up to cope                        with the demands of the new policy nor have Iraqs restrictive security                        procedures been modified The result is a frustrating operational                        environment for both official and private foreigners in Iraq and a                        potential for serious divisions within the regime Foreign governments and                        private firms will continue to find it difficult to deal with the GOI but current economic and political trends                        still provide major opportunities for governments and firms prepared to cope                        with the problems of working in Iraq End                        summary2 Over the past three years the RCC and                        the senior levels of the Baathi regime in Iraq have actively pursued a                        policy of encouraging participation of Western private companies in Iraqs                        development program The regime has also attempted to reduce Iraqs                        international isolation by improving relations with most of the countries in                        the Middle East region and in the rest of the world The most visible                        indications of the latter policy are the constant stream of high level                        governmental delegations to Baghdad Iraqs active participation in a number                        of international meetings and conferences numerous junkets by senior Iraqi                        officials to Asian and African countries the establishment of a number of                        new Embassies in Baghdad and the vigorous promotion of cultural and other                        exchanges with a variety of countries3 While the new policies of openness are receiving vigorous support from                        the top levels of the regime the working levels of the GOI bureaucracy and particularly the powerful                        security services are still operating in a manner more consistent with the                        previous GOI policies of international                        isolation and hostility to all foreigners and foreign influences The                        governmental structure has not been altered to meet the demands the new                        policies place upon it and the restrictive security procedures have not                        been changed4 For example all diplomats in Baghdad except commercial attachs are                        still required to channel all of their contacts with GOI officials through the hopelessly                        overburdened Foreign Ministry Office of Protocol During the Principal                        Officers last call on the Foreign Ministry Director General of Political                        Affairs Ibrahim alWali Wali mentioned that he had just discovered that                        the Belgian Ambassador had asked Protocol for an appointment with him three                        months previously but Protocol had neglected to inform him of the                        Ambassadors request Most Ambassadors in Baghdad complain bitterly over                        Protocols handling of their requests for appointments and many now seem                        resigned to a period of semiretirement until their tours of duty in Baghdad                        are completed5 The Ambassadorial dissatisfactions are further aggravated by the GOIs requirement that all diplomats obtain                        permission for any travel outside of Baghdad While these permissions seem                        to be given freely at least for visits to Iraqs numerous archaeological                        and tourist attractions the procedure requires an application two weeks in                        advance and the reply seldom comes earlier than one day before the planned                        travel All too frequently there are bureaucratic delays and the reply is                        received one day after the planned departure date thus invalidating the                        permission6 The security services have also continued their previous policies of                        brutal harassment of Iraqi citizens who have contacts with foreigners even                        when such contacts are made for legitimate business or professional                        purposes Even senior Foreign Ministry officials are hesitant at being seen                        too often in diplomatic residences and most Ambassadors consider themselves                        fortunate if one or two Foreign Ministry officials actually appear at their                        receptions or dinner parties Unlike other police states the Iraqi security                        services do not seem to employ a stable of cleared individuals who mix                        with the foreign community and report on their activities The degree of                        distrust and suspicion among Iraqis seems to be so great that the security                        services do not trust their own agents to play this role The fear of                        contact with foreigners extends into GOI                        offices where most functionaries find it safer to avoid contact with                        foreigners and consider it expedient to pass any decisions concerning                        foreigners to their superiors7 Even Embassies from countries considered to have excellent relations with                        Iraq are experiencing lengthy and frustrating delays in obtaining visas for                        official personnel Delays of six weeks or longer are now routine as the                        volume of visa requests increases along with the accumulations of paper in                        the inboxes of security officials Approvals for trade missions and working                        level governmental delegations are also taking more and more time and                        several Embassies have had to cancel official delegations at the last minute                        for lack of official GOI sanction even though the planned visits had                        been originated by informal requests from the GOI8 As the conflicts between the new openness policies and the concerns of                        the security agencies become more acute the internal divisions within the                        regime may also become more and more severe Although the RCC now clearly supports openness and the                        requirements of economic development will probably force a longterm trend                        in that direction the security services are not without some potent cards                        to play on their own behalf The regime still feels itself threatened                        particularly from the military and the men in positions of power are                        heavily dependent on the security services for their political and personal                        survival The security services are not constrained by law or tradition and                        have arbitrary and almost unlimited control over the lives of ordinary                        Iraqis Even members of the RCC are no                        doubt heedful of the fact that the last coup attempt in 1973 was launched by                        the then Director of Intelligence and failed by a narrow margin9 Baathi ideology requires that foreigners particularly Westerners be cast                        in role of the imperialist devil as a mechanism for the achievement of                        national unity and the security agencies in the minds of the Baathi                        faithful are the shock troops of Iraqs struggle for unity freedom and                        socialism Even if the security agencies are forced to retreat under the                        pressure of the secular trends towards openness and commercial ties with                        the West it seems likely that they will fight a bitter rear guard action                        and from time to time Iraqs blooming flowers may well by scythed by brutal                        security apparachnics10 In the meantime foreign governments and business concerns will continue                        to experience costly and frustrating delays in doing business with the                            GOI while even minor decisions                        concerning foreigners are pushed up the administrative ladder to senior                        levels for resolution of the conflicting interests of the various components                        within the government11 This state of affairs does not indicate that US firms should stop                        bidding on projects in Iraq Nor does it indicate that the USG should stop conducting business with the                            GOI or supporting US commercial                        interests in Iraq US firms have usually found that their problems with                        the GOI diminish as their operations in                        Iraq become routine and as precedents become established in the minds of                        their GOI counterparts USINT in its official contacts with the                            GOI is treated no worse and in many                        cases better than the Embassies in Baghdad and there are a group of well                        educated and intelligent although frequently frustrated officials in all                        of the GOI Ministries and organizations                        with which USINT has so far had contact                        What it does indicate is that progress official or commercial will be slow                        and that apparently needless and timeconsuming obstacles will be                        encountered resulting in last minute cancellations and costly delays Most Westerners will not be prepared for                        the operational environment in Iraq but with proper advance planning that                        gives adequate weight to the peculiarities of the local scene it will still                        be possible for the USG as well as private                        American firms to take advantage of the longer term political and economic                        trends now underwayWiley	19760427

               PROVISIONSTHUS THE US HAS PROPOSED THE ESTABLISHMENT OF AN IMPARTIAL DISPUTE                            SETTLEMENT MECHANISM WHOSE DECISIONS WOULD BE BINDING ON ALL STATES                            PARTY SUCH A MECHANISM IS ESSENTIAL TO ASSURE THE PROPER BALANCE                            BETWEEN THE RIGHTS OF COASTAL STATES AND THE RIGHTS OF ALL OTHER

EVEN THOUGH THESE COUNTRIES MAY BE A                            NUMERICAL MINORITY TO THIS END THE US CONTINUES TO BELIEVE THAT THE                            TREATY SHOULD AUTHORIZE THE CREATION OF AN INTERNATIONAL SEABED RESOURCE                            AUTHORITY COMPRISED OF FOUR PRINCIPAL ORGANS: AN ASSEMBLY OF ALL MEMBER STATES TO PROVIDE GENERAL POLICY GUIDANCE  A COUNSEL TO SERVE AS AN

                      GRANTING OF EXCLUSIVE RIGHTS OF ACCESS TO THESE RESOURCES TO AN                            INTERNATIONAL AUTHORITY OR THE IMPOSITION OF RESTRICTIONS THAT WOULD                            EFFECTIVELY DENY ACCESS TO THE FIRMS OF ANY INDIVIDUAL NATION INCLUDING                            OUR OWN THE US THEREFORE PROPOSES THAT THE TREATY GUARANTEE                            NONDISCRIMINATORY ACCESS FOR STATES AND THEIR NATIONALS TO DEEP SEABED                            RESOURCES AND WILL ACCEPT THAT AN ENTERPRISE BE ESTABLISHED AS PART OF                            THE INTERNATIONAL SEABED RESOURCE AUTHORITY TO EXPLOIT DEEP SEABED                            RESOURCES UNDER THE SAME CONDITIONS AS OTHER PRODUCERS IF THERE IS BROAD AGREEMENT THE US CAN ACCEPT THE

                      ITSELF OR BY DEVELOPING COUNTRY CONTRACTORS FINALLY THE US SUPPORTS A SYSTEM OF REVENUE SHARING FROM ALL MINING                            ACTIVITIES IN THE DEEP SEABED FOR USE BY THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY                            PRIMARILY FOR THE NEEDS OF THE POOREST COUNTRIESON THE PROBLEM OF THE EFFECTS OF DEEP SEABED MINING ON LANDBASED

      OF A NUCLEAR OPTION THIS UNCUSTOMARY HESITANCE ON MY PART IN SPEAKING                            OUT ON AN ISSUE SO CENTRAL TO OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH PAKISTAN HAS STEMMED                            LARGELY FROM MY APPRECIATION BOTH OF THE POLITICAL AND TECHNICAL                            RAMIFICATIONS OF THE NUCLEAR PROLIFERATION PROBLEM AND OF THE INEVITABLE

VARIOUS APPROACHES AND MY OWN EXCHANGES WITH THE PAKS HAVE NOW MADE                            THE NONPROLIFERATION LANDSCAPE CLEARER AND I FEEL I MIGHT PROFITABLY                            WEIGH IN WITH SOME THOUGHTS AS I SEE THE SITUATION DEVELOPING FROM MY                            ISLAMABAD VANTAGE POINT2 ALTHOUGH I HAVE NOT OF COURSE SEEN THE TEXT OF BHUTTOS REPLY TO THE PRESIDENTS                            LETTER WHICH I UNDERSTAND AMBASSADOR YAQUB EXPECTS TO PASS TO YOU WHEN                            HE RETURNS TO WASHINGTON THIS WEEK I THINK THERE IS LITTLE REASON TO EXPECT THAT THE                            PRIME MINISTER WILL BE AS RESPONSIVE AS WE WOULD WISH TO THE CONCERNS                            AND SUGGESTIONS THE PRESIDENT EXPRESSED TO HIM UNLESS I AM WRONG THE                            REPLY COMING IN THE WAKE OF THE NEGATIVE FRENCH REACTION TO OUR                            DEMARCHE ON THE NEGATIVE FRENCH REACTION TO OUR DEMARCH ON THE                            REPROCESSING PLANT WILL IN EFFECT BRING TO AN END THE FIRST EASY                            PHASE OF THE EXERCISE TO LEAD PAKISTAN AWAY FROM THE NUCLEAR OPTION                            PATH AS WE MOVE AHEAD TO CONSIDER FRENCH OPTIONS IN DEALING WITH THE                            PROBLEM I BELIEVE IT IMPORTANT THAT WE EXAMINE OUR PRIORITIES REGARDING                            PAKISTAN MORE CLOSELY THAN WE WERE PERHAPS ABLE TO DO IN THE HURRIED                            EFFORTS TO GET TO THE PAKS FRENCH GERMANS BEFORE THE TRILATERAL                            SAFEGUARDS WERE APPROVED AND THE PAKFRENCH AGREEMENT SIGNED3 IT SEEMS TO ME THAT WE MUST DETERMINE ANSWERS TO THREE FUNDAMENTAL                            QUESTIONS BEFORE WE CAN DEVISE ANY COHERENT STRATEGY IN WORKING TOWARDS                            OUR GOALS HERE THEY ARE 1 HOW REALLY IMPORTANT IS IT TO US IN THE                            CONTEXT OF OUR OVERALL NONPROLIFERATION EFFORT THAT PAKISTAN BE CLEARLY                            SEEN TO HAVE ABANDONED ITS NUCLEAR OPTION 2 WHERE DOES OUR EFFORT TO                            BRING ABOUT THIS PUBLIC SELFDENYING ACTION ON THE GOPS PART RANK VISAVIS OTHER ASPECTS OF                            OUR RELATIONS WITH PAKISTAN AND STEMMING FROM THESE FIRST TWO                            QUESTIONS 3 WHAT PRICE ARE WE WILLING TO PAY IN TERMS OF OUR                            BILATERAL TIES AND OUR APPROACH TO THE BROADER SOUTH ASIAN REGION TO                            BRING PAKISTAN AROUND I FEAR THAT UNLESS WE COME UP WITH SERIOUSLY                            CONSIDERED ANSWERS TO THESE QUESTIONS WE COULD EASILY STUMBLE INTO                            DIFFICULTIES QUESTIONS WE COULD EASILY STUMBLE INTO DIFFICULTIES EVEN                            GREATER THAN THOSE WE ALREADY FACE IN DEALING WITH THE NUCLEAR PROBLEM                            HERE4 I CERTAINLY CANNOT SUGGEST ANSWERS TO THESE QUESTIONS WHICH HAVE                            SIGNIFICANCE OBVIOUSLY GOING FAR BEYOND OUR LOCAL INTERESTS HERE WHAT I                            WANT TO DO IN THIS MESSAGE IS TO OUTLINE FOR YOU SOME OF THE                            IMPLICATIONS VARIOUS ANSWERS MIGHT HAVE FOR US IN PAKISTAN AND ELSEWHERE                            IN THIS REGION5 I THINK THAT AT THE VERY ONSET WE HAVE GOT TO ASSUME THAT IF WE CONCLUDE THAT                            PAKISTAN MUST BE SEEN TO HAVE GIVEN UP ITS NUCLEAR OPTION AND THAT THIS                            AIM IS OF OVERRIDING IMPORTANCE IN OUR PRIORITIES HERE THEN WE ARE GOING                            TO FACE SOME VERY TOUGH DECISIONS IN WASHINGTON I BELIEVE THAT ALL                            EVIDENCE WEVE SEEN SO FAR INDICATES THAT BHUTTO INTENDS TO KEEP HIS                            NUCLEAR OPTION OPENYOU KNOW HIS REASONSAND THAT IT WILL BE VERY COSTLY                            TO GET HIM TO DO OTHERWISE PARTICULARLY IN WHAT PROMISES TO BE AN                            ELECTION YEAR IN PAKISTAN6 I KNOW THAT YOU WILL PE EXAMINING A SERIES OF OPTIONS DESIGNED TO                            PERSUADE BHUTTO TO CHANGE HIS                            MIND  IF THAT IS INDEED WHAT WE HAVE DETERMINED WE MUST DOAND THAT                            AMONG THESE WILL BE ONE OUTLINING A SUCCESSION OF SUBTLE AND MORE                            OBVIOUS PRESSURES WE CAN BRING TO BEAR ON THE PAKS HOWEVER ADVISABLE OR                            EVEN NECESSARY THIS APPROACH MAY POSSIBLY SEEM IN TERMS OF CONGRESSIONAL                            ATTITUDES AND THE IMPACT IT MAY BE THOUGHT TO HAVE ON NUCLEAR SUPPLIERS                            AND THRESHOLD COUNTRIES I DONT THINK IT WILL WORK MY JUDGEMENT IS                            THAT BHUTTO IS MOST UNLIKELY TO                            BE BROUGHT AROUND BY THREATS AND PRESSURES WHETHER THESE ARE                            DIPLOMATICALLY PHRASED IN TERMS OF POTENTIAL PROBLEMS ON THE HILL OR PUT                            IN THE MORE DIRECT LANGUAGE OF NEGATIVE LINKAGE TO ONGOING OR                            ANTICIPATED ECONOMIC AID AND MILITARY SALES PROGRAMS I DONT QUESTION                            THE VERY REAL POSSIBILITY OF CONGRESSIONAL FALLOUT THE PAKISTANIS FOR                            THEIR PART MAY BE SKEPTICAL ABOUT ITS GENUINENESS AND MAY SUSPECT THAT                            THE EXECUTIVE INSTIGATED IT BUT WHATEVER CONCLUSIONS THEY REACH THEY                            ARE UNLIKELY TO BE DETERRED ANY NUMBER OF SCENARIOS CAN BE PREPARED                            MAPPING OUT THE WAY THINGS WILL GO IF WE PERSIST IN THIS NEGATIVE                            APPROACH IN MY VIEW THEY WILL ALL HAVE TWO THINGS IN COMMON: A SERIOUS                            DETERIORATION IN USPAKISTAN RELATIONS COUPLED WITH FAILURE TO BRING THE                            PAKS AROUND WE WILL HAVE GOT OURSELVES THE WORST OF BOTH WORLDS7 INDEED THE LIKELIHOOD OF THE PAKS PERSISTING IN ACHIEVING A NUCLEAR                            OPTION WILL PROBABLY BE INCREASED RATHER THAN DIMINISHED BY OUR TAKING                            THIS HARSH LINE WITH THEM IF BHUTTO IS AS DETERMINED TO GO AHEAD WITH A COMPLETE                            NUCLEAR FUEL CYCLE WE BELIEVE HE IS AND IF HE PERCEIVES THAT HIS                            POSSIBILITIES FOR OBTAINING AND PAYING FOR THE CONVENTIONAL WEAPONS HE                            FEELS PAKISTAN NEEDS WILL BE SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED BY OUR ACTIONS A                            NUCLEAR DETERRENT COULD BECOME AN EVEN MORE ATTRACTIVE PROPOSITION FOR                            HIM I AM NOT IN A POSITION TO JUDGE WHAT THE INDIANS WOULD DO UNDER                            THESE CIRCUMSTANCES A PAKISTAN WITH LIMITED CONVENTIONAL MILITARY POWER                            SEEMINGLY GOING DOWN THE NUCLEAR ROAD BUT IS CERTAINLY RELEVANT TO                            QUESTION THE EFFECT SUCH A SITUATION WOULD HAVE ON WHAT HAS UP TILL NOW                            BEEN OUR PRIMARY GOAL OF REGIONAL STABILITY8 A MORE POSITIVE APPROACH HAVE BETTER PROSPECTS FOR SUCCESS THAN THIS                            NEGATIVE NONSTARTER BUT IN CONSIDERING THAT STRATEGY WE SHOULD NOT                            DELUDE OURSELVES ABOUT THE COSTS INVOLVED THESE ARE LIKELY TO BE HIGH                            THEY ARE CERTAINLY GOING TO BE HIGHER THAN THE COUPLE OF SQUADRONS OF                            A7S I UNDERSTAND SOME IN THE DEPARTMENT HAVE ALREADY SUGGESTED AS AN                            APPROPRIATE QUID PRO QUO IF WE DECIDE THAT NONPROLIFERATION MUST BE GIVEN THE HIGHEST PRIORITY                            WE WILL HAVE TO INVOLVE OURSELVES MORE DEEPLY IN PAKISTANS SECURITY                            CONCERNS THAN WEVE BEEN WILLING TO DO BEFORE BHUTTO SUGGESTED AS MUCH IN WASHINGTON                            LAST FEBRUARY WHEN HE SAID FOR THE PRIVATE RECORD THAT IN DEVELOPING                            ITS NUCLEAR TECHNOLOGY PAKISTAN WOULD NOT DIVERT ANY OF ITS URGENTLY                            NEEDED DEVELOPMENT RESOURCES TO THE EXPENSIVE EFFORTS REQUIRED TO                            PRODUCE A NUCLEAR EXPLOSION BEGIN UNDERLINE PROVIDED ITS DEFENSE IN                            THE CONVENTIONAL FIELD IS ASSURED END UNDERLINE WE WILL HAVE TO                            MOVE FURTHER AND FASTER IN OUR MILITARY SALES PROGRAMS THAN WEVE BEEN                            PREPARED TO DO SINCE THE ARMS EMBARGO WAS LIFTED WE HAD BETTER FACE THE                            FACT THAT THIS MIGHT EVEN INVOLVE OUR AGREEING TO SELL THE PAKS MEDIUM                            TANKS THE NEXT MAJOR ITEM AFTER FIGHTER AIRCRAFT ON THE LIST OF                            EQUIPMENT IN WHICH THEYVE SHOWN AN INTEREST IM NOT RECOMMENDING THAT                            WE GO THIS ROUTE WHICH ASSOCIATES US WITH THE PAKS MUCH MORE CLOSELY                            THAN I HAVE THOUGHT APPROPRIATE BUT IF WE ARE IN DEAD EARNEST ABOUT                            NONPROLIFERATION WE MAY HAVE TO START DOWN IT AND BE PREPARED TO ACCEPT                            THE CONSEQUENCES WHETHER CONGRESS WILL ACCEPT OUR ASSESSMENT OF THE                            PRIORITIES INVOLVED AND ALLOW US TO DO SO IS A QUESTION YOU ARE IN A                            BETTER POSITION THAN I TO ANSWER9 AMONG THESE CONSEQUENCES OF COURSE WILL BE TROUBLE WITH INDIA FOR                            ANY MEANINGFUL EFFORT TO SATISFY PAKISTANS SECURITY NEEDS IN THE                            CONVENTIONAL FIELD AS A MEANS OF HEADING OFF HER GOING THE NUCLEAR ROUTE                            WILL INEVITABLY PRODUCE AN ADVERSE REACTION IN DELHI WHICH IS NOT                            LIKELY TO BE IMPRESSED BY THE NONPROLIFERATION ARGUMENT AND COULD                            REQUIRE SIGNIFICANT MODIFICATIONS IN OUR SOUTH ASIAN ARMS SUPPLY POLICY                            OTHER GOALS WE SEEK IN THE REGION MAY BE ENDANGERED BY IN THE PROCESS                            AGAIN IT IS A QUESTION OF PRIORITIES10 PERHAPS OUR BEST HOPE RESTS IN A COMBINATION OF POSITIVE MEASURES TO                            ENHANCE PAKISTANS SECURITY AND TO PROVIDE BHUTTO WITH VISIBLE EVIDENCE                            OF OUR CONCERN FOR ENABLING HIM TO BE SEEN TO BE ACHIEVING THE BASICALLY PHONY ECONOMIC PURPOSES                            HE CITES AS HIS OSTENSIBLE REASON FOR ACQUIRING NUCLEAR TECHNOLOGY                            PARTICIPATION IN A MULTINATIONAL REPROCESSING FACILITY SUGGESTED TO                            BHUTTO BY BOTH THE PRESIDENT AND YOURSELF COULD BE SUCH A FACESAVING                            GAMBIT WITH IRAN THE OBVIOUS PLACE FOR THE PLANT ALTHOUGH THIS WOULD                            BE VERY HARD INDEED FOR BHUTTO TO                            SWALLOW AT THIS LATE STAGE I WOULD URGE THAT WE LOOK CAREFULLY AT THIS                            POSSIBILITY AND DO WHATEVER WE CAN DO INTEREST BOTH THE SHAH AND                                BHUTTO IN IT LOOKING AT THE                            PROBLEM IN TERMS OF FORESTALLING A NUCLEAR PAKISTAN I WOULD HOPE THAT                            IF NECESSARY WE ADOPT AS FLEXIBLE AN APPROACH AS POSSIBLE IN THE                            CONTEXT OF OUR OTHER REQUIREMENTS TOWARDS SAFEGUARDING SUCH A                            FACILITY11 I HOPE THAT ALL OF THIS WILL BE OF SOME USE IF I HAVE SKETCHED OUT                            MY PERCEPTIONS IN FAIRLY STARK TERMS IT IS BECAUSE I BELIEVE WE FACE A                            VERY A VERY DIFFICULT SITUATION WHICH CALLS FOR SOME VERY

frus1969-76ve08d94	94 Telegram 1387 From the Embassy in Sri Lanka to the Department of State April 19 1976 1145ZPresident Ibrahim Nasir of the Maldives discussed with Ambassador VAN HOLLEN the economic and political problems arising from the British abandonment of Gan and mentioned Soviet interest in the base The Embassy recommended that the Department consider the issue carefully given the proximity of Gan to Diego Garcia	None	1976-04-19 11:45:00	None	None	FINAL DRAFTSri Lanka Policy Guidance PaperApril 16 1976I OverviewA small and poor country Sri Lanka in the 1970s has faced two broad                            challenges Externally the key to its effective independence and                            sovereignty lies in the state of its relations with India The Sinhalese                            majority in Sri Lanka historically has been acutely conscious of its                            vulnerability to its giant neighbor A cautious deference to Delhi where                            Indias prestige and basic interests are involved and reciprocal Indian                            sensitivity to Sri Lanka concerns especially on the Tamil minority                            problem have yielded a good bilateral relationship largely free of the                            frictions that plague Indias relations with its other South Asian                            neighborsAt the same time Sri Lankas chronically poor economic and financial                            position has created an urgent need for largescale external aid A                            nonaligned but pragmatic foreign policy has been the mechanism through                            which Sri Lanka has sought aid from both East and West and the                            broadbased support which reminds India that the Ceylonese have other                            windows on the world Equally important the longstanding commitment to                            nonalignment has expanded Sri Lankas external horizon from a regional                            perspective with India as its focus to global issues and a worldwide                            network of diplomatic contacts In the process Sri Lankas freedom of                            action has increased enabling it to carve out its own sphere of                            initiative within the nonaligned movementThe current cordial state of USSri Lanka relations contrasts with                            earlier strains caused by expropriation problems and ideological                            friction We have worked hard to overcome the initial suspicion of US                            intentions and motives within Prime Minister Bandaranaikes socialistoriented government while                            stressing the compatibility of US interests with Ceylonese                            nonalignment We accept the GSLs                            posture as adding to stability in South Asia and offering us equal                            access in dealing with Sri Lanka as an Indian Ocean state and a Third                            World moderate We have adopted a low profile in Sri Lanka a                            selfdenying posture which is important to the Ceylonese as it reduces                            opportunities and the rationale for other powers ie India PRC                                USSR to seek a dominant position                            in Sri LankaIn turn Prime Minister Bandaranaike has taken the lead within the GSL in reorienting Sri Lankas relations                            with the US but leftist opposition remains strong Our present                            relationship is thus delicately balanced and will remain so even if the                            more conservative opposition should form a government after the 1977                            parliamentary elections Our aim will be to consolidate our improved                            relations but slowly and with no sudden expansion of US involvement                            or resourcesII Major US InterestsSri Lanka impinges directly on our interest: a in encouraging regional                            stability in South Asia: b in balancing the Soviet presence in the                            Indian Ocean region c in evolving a constructive relationship and                            dialogue with nonaligned Third World countries on a variety of                            multilateral issues However the Ceylonese capacity to function in a                            manner which complements US objectives in all three areas and which                            supports specific assets such as our VOA facilities rests on the                            viability and evenhandedness of Sri Lankas nonaligned postureOur interest lies in promoting a politically stable and economically                            viable Sri Lanka whose internal strength offers no vacuum for an outside                            power to exploit While accepting Indian preponderance in South Asia we                            have no wish to see a neighboring state such as Sri Lanka lose its                            capacity to maintain its own independent policies Our bilateral                            relationship is important to both countries independently of each                            others relations with IndiaWe wish to see Sri Lanka avoid a condition of dependence on others which                            could jeopardize the GSLs existing                            policy of not permitting foreign military facilities in Sri Lanka Such                            a development would seriously disturb the strategic situation in South                            Asia and the Indian Ocean generally and could undermine our naval                            ships current access to Sri Lanka for shore leave and bunkering                            services a valuable asset in maintaining our naval presence in the                            Indian OceanFinally Sri Lankas prominence in the nonaligned movement has enhanced                            the value of our bilateral ties as a channel for encouraging a moderate                            LDC stance on issues directly affecting American interests Sri Lankas                            role as host of the 1976 NonAligned Summit Conference as Chairman of                            the Coordinating Secretariat of the NonAligned Movement as likely                            President of the 1976 UNGA its                            leadership in key fora such as the Law of the Sea negotiations UNCTAD                            Group of 77 illustrate its exceptional involvement in multilateral                            affairs Our bilateral ties to Sri Lanka thus have a significance and                            value to US multilateral interests beyond the normal scope of                            relations with a small countryIII US Policy Objectives and Courses of Action1 Stable Bilateral RelationsObjective: Against a background of considerable fluctuation in the past                            we should aim for stable relations capable of surviving a change of                            government Cordiality rather than intimacy should be our goal as this                            will best assure good relations over timeCourses of Action: Maintain a low profile in our approach to Sri Lanka in personnel                            levels operating style and general conduct of relations Our support should be for a democratic political system and not for any                            particular party We should eschew any appearance of partisan political                            preference or interference in Ceylonese internal affairs and maintain                            continuing contact with all main elements of the political spectrum                            including the opposition and the left Our aid should be carefully scaled to our official profile oriented to                            development and not be seen as captive of a single partys domestic                            politics Encourage quietly an atmosphere conducive to American private

survival of Sri Lankas democratic                            parliamentary framework including the transition to a younger leadership                            committed to parliamentary democracyCourses of Action: Offer no encouragement to Tamil separatists or to the concept of a                            Tamil state in Northern Sri Lanka Orient IV grants and other official semiofficial and private exchange                            opportunities to potential leaders Promote broadgauged receptivity to Western influence including                            USGsponsored

encouraging agricultural selfsufficiency and more effective                            economic policiesCourses of Action: Orient development lending assistance in channels which offer                            longrange growth possibilities Coordinate aid policies with the IBRD IMF and Western aid donors as                            means of encouraging GSL adherence to                            financial fiscal pricing and import policies supportive of increased                            food production aiming at agricultural selfsufficiency Encourage a positive attitude to the potential contribution of private                            American capital and technical resources and to private sector                            capabilities in Sri Lanka4 Cooperation on International IssuesObjective: We wish to encourage Sri Lankas commitment to DCLDC                            cooperation and to promote a GSL role in                            fashioning nonaligned consensus in a moderate directionCourses of Action: Keep the Ceylonese informed of our priorities on multilateral                            issues Consult with the GSL in general terms                            on
