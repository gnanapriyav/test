ScaliSummary: Iraqi Amb                        ElShibib replying to your confidential comments to him at UN luncheon Apr 15No record of the luncheon has been found said he authorized

economic relations with US firms                        and 4 will not seek to block or conspire against EgyptianSyrian peace                        moves even despite adverse Iraqi propaganda End                            summary1 ElShibib met with me alone at USUN                        Mission to relay what he termed not startling info but our sincere                        readiness to begin serious dialogue in answer to your initiative April 15                        when you sat beside him at SYG luncheon ElShibib said his govt                        particularly interested in and appreciative of your assurance that USG not interested in encouraging separatist                        movement in Iraq This is viewed by his govt as a very positive and helpful                        attitude on part of USG However he said                            USG cld reinforce this positive                        attitude by encouraging Iran which Iraq believes had exceedingly close ties                        with USG to follow up easing of border                        difficulties by serious meaningful negotiations for permanent settlement of                        problem Unless USG puts some pressure on                        Iran Tehran govt will feel it has leeway to create continuing problems even                        though Iraq is encouraged by your comment that USG is not encouraging Barzani rebel movement2 In answer to your question about Iraqi relations with Sov Govt Iraqi Govt wants you to know it is                        not client of anyone and has not closed its doors to any state ElShibib                        noted that Iraq has restored relations with all WE govts including UK and West Germany and that its policy is to                        cooperate economically with all nations ElShibib said American companies                        are beginning to do good business with Iraq Specifically he noted that                        an American firm had been given the biggest contract to develop deepwater                        port in south Iraq and that three American companies are among seven foreign                        firms invited to submit bids for gas liquifying project Economically no                        doors are closed to the US Iraq is deeply interested in practical                        pragmatic cooperation with USG and hopes to                        be able to increase such economic relations3 ElShibib said his govt recognizes that important political differences                        will continue with USG in ME area with little prospect that either side                        can convince the other of justice of its case in near future But perhaps by                        establishing a dialogue USG and Iraq can                        limit their differences Iraq is very willing to do this4 Whenever there is a positive sign of action from USG he said it will be reciprocated by the Iraqi side just as                        positively He cautioned however against expecting dramatic developments                        quickly because any sudden changes would be counterproductive in too short                        a period of time ElShibib said negative Iraqi radio and press reaction to                        SyrianIsraeli disengagement agreement should not be looked on as overly                        important Iraq must adopt such an ideological position in view of its                        traditional attitude but he said Iraq will not overthrow or seek to                        conspire against governments seeking to cooperate with USG The Iraqi Govts attitude should not be                        viewed as being as negative as its propaganda Further whatever negative                        positions Iraq advances diplomatically shld not be overblown in the ME context ElShibib mentioned IraqiIranian                        relations three times His main point was that Tehran cld be pressed by the                            USG to be far more reasonable If                        Irans attitude became more cooperative as a followup to the UNSC border compromise Iraq wld note this as                        a positive result In this connection he acknowledged that US had already                        played a helpful role in negotiating a compromise via UNSC to ease border tensionsIn UN Security Council                            Resolution 348 adopted unanimously on May 28 Iran and Iraq agreed to                            withdraw their armed forces from the border and resume negotiations for                            a peaceful settlement of all bilateral issues See Yearbook of the United Nations 1974 pp 2522565 The time appears at hand ElShibib said for Iraq and Iran to move                        farther and arrive at an equitable settlement of longstanding differences                        ElShibib said he wld not forget your comment about how US and Mexicos                        border was a peaceful one because it had been agreed to with the objective                        of making it fair for both sides6 In answer to his comments I noted USG                        had already played leading role in encouraging Iran to compromise its                        differences with Iraq Iraqi Govt                        shld not expect Iran to listen obediently every time USG advised particular course because as cld                        be seen from recent Iranian economic moves Iran frequently takes positions                        it believes in its own national interests regardless of views of friends                        However I said that USG believed it to be                        in best interest of region for IraqIran Govts to follow up UN compromise with active negots to settle                        outstanding issues Actions as well as words of Iraqi Govt will be watched                        in weeks ahead to form our own judgment about whether actual Iraqi policy                        less negative than propaganda which at times of incendiary nature USG fully recognizes I said that propaganda                        level is no reliable index to what true govt position is in ME particularly7 Accordingly I told him I would relay his views to you with confident                        belief you would wish to continue highestlevel dialogue I cautioned                        against any leaks to any govt or media of discussions saying USG would regard this as sign Iraq not really                        interested On US side I said you would wish to confine those knowing of                        dialogue only to President and me to guarantee maximum candor flexibility                        and results satisfactory to both sides8 ElShibib said he was sure his govt wanted to keep talks confined to Prime                        Min Fon Min and him only He said he wld be returning to Baghdad Monday or                            TuesdayJune 10 or 11 and would be                        happy to relay any additional message and would be prepared to wait few days                        if necessary to hear from youScali	19740605

multiplication of oil revenues has                        given Iran new tools to carry out its longcherished desire to play more                        influential role on world scene particularly in regional affairs Shah has                        skillfully used this economic leverage to enhance Irans political and                        strategic objectives and country is riding wave of confidence and pride in                        its new prominence and power In past six months some thirty countries have                        sent highlevel delegations to Iran seeking aid and trade agreements and                        many have offered political IOUs in exchange In Persian Gulf area Iran has                        sought to safeguard its oil lifeline by building its own armed strength and                        giving economic and in case of Oman military aid to bolster sheikdoms and                        help them survive insurgent threats Hostility towards Iraq which Shah views                        as Soviet stalkinghorse and regional troublemaker will continue for time                        being On subcontinent in order to foster stability and bring its own                        relations into better alignment with power realities Iran has drawn closer                        to India while maintaining good rapport with other countries Improvement of                        relations with Egypt and Syria will give Iran new backing in Arab councils                        while economic deals with dozen African countries will increase Irans                        influence there and provide it with many needed commodities Shah remains                        deeply suspicious of Soviet intentions and actions in Middle East and                        commercial and political disputes have cooled relations between two countries With China however                        relations have improved considerably because of congruent interests                        Numerous OECD countries recently have                        negotiated economic deals with Iran which could possibly amount to 18                        billion or more and Iran is purchasing increasing but still small share                        of its military hardware from Europeans United States remains single most                        important country for Iran Fundamentally our interests are similar and our                        relations excellent and we should continue to play influential if not                        exclusive role in Irans development as a substantial power End summary2 Shah has long been determined to carve out role in world affairs for Iran                        commensurate with its size wealth and past glory Thanks largely to recent                        multiplication of its oil revenues Iran now enjoys greater ability to                        project its power and influence abroad than it has had for centuries                        Iranians are riding wave of confidence and ebullience about their foreign                        relations and are taking enormous satisfaction from image of British                        Italians and others rushing to Iran for help in solving their economic                            difficultiesIn telegrams 5469 and 5681 from                            Tehran July 3 and 11 Helms                            reported the Shahs plan to advance 1 billion to France over the next 3                            years in prepayment of imports needed in joint ventures and 12

Ministers and economic delegationsover thirty in                        past six monthshas come to Tehran seeking aid or trade Similarly Iranian                        officials have carried offers of economic assistance joint commercial and                        investment ventures and guaranteed oil supply to all parts of Asia Africa                        and Europe On multilateral scale Shah has also seized initiative by                        proposing establishment of development assistance fund for LDCs and promising large loans to IMF and IBRD                        to cushion effects of higher oil prices on LDCsSee footnote 3 Document 533 Shah has used Irans new economic leverage to enhance his longterm                        political and strategic objectives exchanging economic concessions most of                        which will not come due for many years for political IOUs Among these                        objectives discussed in more detail below are A assuring dominant                        political and military role for Iran in Persian Gulf and eventually                        effective influence in Indian Ocean affairs B thwarting what Shah sees as                        continuing Soviet threat to Iran through encirclement and subversion of                        Gulf Indian Ocean and subcontinental states C isolating Iraq and gaining                        settlement of conflict with that country on terms acceptable to Iran D                        undercutting radical Arab influence in underdeveloped world and increasing                        Irans influence with LDCs and E                        assuring necessary supplies and markets for future Iranian industry after                        oil runs out4 Clearly Iran has made remarkable use recently of its economic and                        diplomatic assets to gain new influence and to project an image of strength                        and responsibility on international scene In assessing this performance                        however we must not lose sight of fact that for present at least much of                        this image is more a statement of future intentions than of current reality                        In many ways Iran is still very much an underdeveloped country itself and                        will require years of steady progress domestically before it can make good                        on all commitments and promises it is now making Although thin layer of                        trained technocrats is very good indeed only about onethird of population                        can read and write and country is already hardpressed to find people with                        managerial and technical skills it requires Diplomatic service which must                        carry out expanded foreign policy is critically short of competent middle                        and senior level talent It will be years before military has received and                        assimilated impressive arsenal of new weapons now on order Industrial base                        on which Iran pins its hopes for postoil power is still in embryonic stage                        And Iran is desperately dependent upon drive vision and skill of one man                        to continue it moving rapidly toward that world position it already claims                        for itself5 There follows a region by region analysis of recent developments in                        Iranian foreign policy and an assessment of what it all means for the United                        States6 Persian Gulf and Arabian Peninsula Notwithstanding expansion of                        diplomatic and economic influence on subcontinent and in Eastern                        Mediterranean and Africa area which remains most vital to Iran is nearby                        Persian Gulf and Arabian Peninsula Ever since 1968 when British announced                        plans to withdraw Shah has sought to become dominant power in region in                        order to safeguard oil lifeline upon which all of Irans plans to become a                        major power and to develop the great civilization depend Shah is deeply                        concerned with potential for instability in Gulf states and with Soviet and                        radical Arab efforts to exploit it For some time he has sought in a variety                        of ways to establish mutual security arrangements with other littoral                        states but none except Oman has responded positively Iran is providing                        substantial military assistance to help Oman defeat PDRYbacked insurgentsIn exchange for Iranian economic and military aid Oman                            agreed to provide facilities for the expansion of the Iranian military                            presence according to telegram 1869 from Tehran March 8 National                            Archives RG 59 Central Foreign Policy                            Files P7401450919 and is giving economic and development                        assistance to a number of Gulf sheikdoms to help assure their survival and                        political cooperation Among reasons Arabs have been reluctant to                        collaborate on defense arrangements are lingering distrust of Irans size                        and strength fear that such a pact could provide Iran with carte blanche to                        intervene on Arab side of Gulf and reluctance to take sides between Iran and Iraq against whom pact would                        clearly be directed In any case if Shah perceived that subversion or coups                        in littoral states genuinely threatened free passage through Gulf he                        probably would take whatever action he considered necessary and possible                        whether previous collective security arrangements existed or not7 Geographically Saudi Arabia should be Irans natural partner in                        maintaining security of Gulf but Iranian efforts to foster greater                        collaboration thus far have not succeeded In addition to reasons mentioned                        above other factors inhibiting effective cooperation have been traditional                        ArabIranian hostility Irans seizure of Tunbs and Abu Musa Saudi                        realization that under present conditions it would be junior partner Irans                        relations with Israel and in recent months difference over oil price                        policy Nevertheless Shah wants a stronger Saudi Arabia able and willing to                        cooperate to ensure peace and stability in Gulf although he professes                        little hope for positive Saudi contribution as long as Faysal rules Shah                        agrees with our reasons for recent massive aid and arms offer to Saudis and                        does not feel threatened by it perhaps because he realizes Iran is already                        so far ahead and increasing its lead8 Despite reestablishment of diplomatic relations with IraqSee footnote 2 Document                                236 that country remains focus of Irans most intense                        hostility and suspicion not only because of ethnic religious and political                        differences and longstanding border disputes but also because Shah is                        convinced Iraq has become stalkinghorse for Soviet penetration of Middle                        East and stirs up subversion throughout region Consequently Shah is not                        interested in piecemeal improvement in relations such as settlement of land                        frontier dispute which would take pressure off Iraqis but not solve                        essential difficulties Instead he has made clear he wants package deal                        which would not only settle land border and Shatt alArab disputes but lead                        to cessation of Iraqi interference in affairs of other states as well                        Further recent aggravant in relations is heavy Iraqi bombing of Kurdish                        population which Shah condemns as genocide against ethnic group related to                        Iranians Iran doubtless will continue to give enough assistance to Kurds to                        keep them from being defeated both for humanitarian reasons and because                        conflict keeps Iraqi Government off balance In longer term Shah hopes to                        see less Sovietinfluenced and more cooperative government replace present                        Baathist regime9 Subcontinent In early 1974 Pakistanis were jolted when Iran reached new                        cooperative agreement with India and seemed to downgrade special                        relationship it had had with Pakistan After 1971 war not wanting weak and                        unstable Pakistan on its border and fearing further dismemberment of Pakistan which might have attracted                        Iranian Baluchis to an autonomous Baluchistan Iran made it emphatically                        clear that it stood behind Pakistan and issued strong statements of support                        for its territorial integrity For its part India unconvinced by Irans                        assurances that agreement with Pakistan was purely defensive and wanting to                        ensure steady supply of oil entered into closer political and military                        relations with Irans enemy Iraq10 Strategic implications of close political and military ties between                        India Iraq and Soviet Union worried Iran especially after an apparently                        leftist coup in Afghanistan seemed to add another link in chain of hostile                        encirclement Relations between Iran and India continued to deteriorate not                        because of any bilateral dispute but because of mutual suspicions about                        other countrys arms buildup and intention toward Pakistan11 By late 1973 Iranian relations with subcontinent countries began to shift                        into better reflection of power realities there On one hand Irans special                        relationship with Pakistan began to cool because of Bhuttos cultivation of Arab states                        particularly Libya and fact that close support of Pakistan complicated                        Irans relations with Afghanistan this coincided with Indias increased                        willingness to take pragmatic view of Irans role in area New atmosphere of                        good will grew as both sides began to realize advantages of closer                        collaboration In December Shah singled out India as kind of country where                        Iran was prepared to invest surplus capital and major trade agreement                        followed in February 1974 effectively giving oil at concessionary prices and                        promising heavy investment in industry to India in exchange for commodities                        Mrs Gandhis visit to Tehran in late April further cleared air politically                        and laid groundwork for still closer cooperation particularly in commercial                        field One area of potential conflict in future is Indian Ocean where two                        countries both have ambitions but disagree on role superpowers should                        play12 Rapprochement with India has not resulted in Irans abandonment of good                        relations with Pakistan but has only brought them into better balance                        During Bhuttos visit in March Shah                        reassured him of continuing concern for Pakistans territorial integrity                        promised to continue modest program of military cooperation and offered                        generous financial aid to meet balance of payments and development                        needs13 Similarly Iran has used its new wealth to improve relations and increase                        influence with Afghanistan and most recently Bangladesh Iranians now see                        Daud as nonCommunist who is probably best leader likely to arise and are                        doing what they can to buttress him in power although they have to proceed                        carefully to avoid Afghan charges of paternalism Having waited to recognize                        Bangladesh until after Bhutto did so Iran has now offered                        limited assistance to help keep that country afloat thereby enhancing                        subcontinents stability14 Near East and Africa Irans relations with Egypt in recent months have                        taken even more dramatic turn for better than with India Shah who despised                        and feared Nasserism admires Sadat and before October war had made several                        moves to improve relations with Egypt He was pleased when in early 1974                        Sadat encouraged Numeiry of Sudan and Qabus of Oman to turn to Iran for                        assistance Short time later Shah sent Minister of Economy to Cairo to see                        whether offer of Iranian economic assistance would help heal rift between                        two countries Finding it would he invited Egyptian Deputy Prime Minister                        to Tehran in May where substantial aid and development pact amounting to                        nearly one billion dollars was signedThe                            Embassy reported in telegram 4241 from Tehran May 27 that the recent                            visit of the Egyptian Deputy Prime Minister Dr Abdel Aziz Hegazi had                            produced an agreement for Iranian loans and credits totaling 870                            million with details to be worked out later National Archives RG 59 Central Foreign Policy Files                            D7401320920 Undoubtedly Shah hopes this investment will                        reinforce split between Egypt on one hand and USSR and Libya on other gain Egyptian assistance in moderating                        Iraqi policy and lead to Egyptian support for Iranian views in Arab oil                        councils and international organizations15 For somewhat similar reason and again using economic aid as means Iran                        has drawn closer to Syria although Shah still has doubts about intentions                        and trustworthiness of Assad Given progress in achieving MidEast peace                        settlement and simultaneous improvement in US relations with Syria and                        Egypt Irans new relationship with those two countries should not endanger                        its ties with Israel and may even make it possible to bring them more into                        open16 In Africa Iran has recently offered or concluded economic assistance                        agreements with Sudan Senegal Zaire Morocco Tunisia Lesotho Kenya                        Ethiopia Nigeria Ivory Coast and South Africa In addition to increasing                        Irans political influence in those countries simultaneously undercutting                        radical Arab influence in black Africa and paving way for African support                        on international issues these deals will provide Iran with many needed                        commodities access to markets for future industrial output and                        constructive use for its surplus oil revenues17 Relations with other countries Despite better relations with Soviet                        Union and series of aid trade and development agreements since 1962 Shah                        remains deeply suspicious of Soviet intentions toward Iran and Middle East                        With declining Soviet influence in Eastern Mediterranean he fears USSR will now turn with increased vigor to                        expanding its influence in Gulf through closer ties with Iraq and support of                        insurgent attempts to topple conservative governments in littoral states                            Opening of Suez Canal will                        facilitate this Soviet effort in Shahs view For that reason he favors                        continuing US military presence in Indian Ocean as a balance to Soviet                        although in pursuit of better relations with India and other LDCs he still publicly professes support for                        nuclearfree Indian Ocean resolution Other strains on relations between two                        countries have been quantity of Iranian arms purchases Irans military                        assistance to Oman in Dhofar fighting and its CENTO role and bilateral ties to US Outside security field                        Shah is resentful of USSR for high price                        it charges for steel mill equipment low price it pays for Iranian natural                        gas unwillingness to renegotiate gas price as called for in agreement and                        increasingly hostile antiIranian propaganda broadcasts from Moscow and                        client statesThe Embassy noted in telegram 4716                            from Tehran June 10 that Iran was taking public positions on Indian                            Ocean and Persian Gulf regional issues in conflict with those of the                            Soviet Union Ibid D7401480523 In spite of these strains and                        divergent interests however Shah recognizes that it is essential for Iran                        to maintain minimally good relations with its colossus to the north and                        therefore to extent possible he tries avoid public confrontation with                        Soviets18 Since 1971 Iran has sought better relations with China as longterm                        political counterweight to USSR Iranian                        and Chinese interests have coincided on such matters as support of Pakistan                        against further dismemberment opposition to stronger Soviet influence in                        India and Afghanistan and for differing reasons opposition to                        Sovietsponsored Asian collective security system Shah established                        diplomatic relations with China in 1971 and sent Empress on goodwill visit                        following year Since then Irans commercial and economic ties with China                        have expanded somewhat and air service between capitals will begin this                        summer but it is still in political sphere that relations are most                        important19 In recent months OECD countries also                        have scrambled to get part of Iranian action and to ensure their future oil                        supply Trade jointventure investment and technical agreements which                        could amount to 18 billion or more have been negotiated or discussed with                        Germany France UK Italy and Canada                        among others In military field Iran has diversified its sources of supply:                        it purchases British tanks hovercraft and missiles French patrol boats                        Russian vehicles and artillery German tank engines and Israeli                        communications equipment although great bulk of military hardware is still                        bought from US Shahs policy is to keep Imperial Air Force 100 percent                        American equipped Highlevel visits have been exchanged with many East and                        West European countries and Shah and Empress themselves are in France at                        this moment Unlike case of China basic importance of Iranian links with European countries and                        Japan is in economic terms although byproduct of improved political                        relations is important secondary benefit20 United States and Iran Despite expansion of Iranian ties with other                        areas of world single most important and influential country for Iran                        remains United States There are no major issues between us aside from                        difference on oil price and we have many mutually beneficial interests                        Iran looks to us to provide A strategic umbrella which allows it to play                        major regional role even when its policies conflict with those of USSR B sophisticated military hardware and                        training in its operation and maintenance C modern technology plants                        equipment and services D education for large portion of its

             play responsible role in region B it has history of close and friendly                        ties with US C it is reliable and important source of oil and other                        resources D it is growing market for our goods and services 7 billion                        in US civilian and military contracts in past two years and a hospitable                        location

intelligence facilitiesIn                            telegram 138373 to Tehran June 27 the Department recommended                            declassification of the fact that the US Air Force with the approval                            of the Iranian Government operated a research station on the Shahs                            Royal game preserve for the purpose of monitoring the Limited Test Ban                            Treaty and conducting research used in support of possible future                            international agreements on nuclear testing Ibid                            D740169067021 In general US and Iranian foreign policy interests have coincided in                        recent years and as our aid and tutelage phased out a close relationship as                        equal partners has evolved We have encouraged Shah to play constructive                        leadership role in regional affairs and in Gulf Iranian actions seem almost                        classic case of Nixon Doctrine in                        action However we should continue to seek ways to encourage Saudi Arabia                        to play more active regional role so Irans increasing predominance does not                        overwhelm and frighten other littoral states Irans efforts to maintain a                        balance in its relations with East and West Arabs and Israel India and                        Pakistan developed and developing parallels our own and should be                        encouraged We must recognize however that these diversified ties                        combined with Iranian pride nationalism and selfassertiveness may                        sometimes lead to differences in our view of bilateral or international                        issues One such difference on horizon may be in international economic                        field where Iran is espousing views which would require fundamental changes                        in monetary trade and economic structure built up over past thirty years                        Another area of possible concern in future is whether Iranian military power                        becomes so disproportionate to that of its neighbors that it ceases to be stabilizing factor                        and becomes disruptive22 But given fundamentally excellent relations between our countries and                        assets we can bring to bear there is every reason to believe we will win                        our share of these disagreements as we do with other countries and will                        continue to play an important and influential if not exclusive role in the                        development of Iran as a substantial powerHelms	19740626
frus1969-76v27d63	63 Telegram From the Department of State to the Embassy in Iran	None	1974-06-28 22:04:00	None	None	140768 Subject: Uranium Enrichment Contracts for Iran Ref: State                            139702Telegram 139702 to Tehran June 27                            informed the Embassy that the AEC                            representative would handcarry two uranium enrichment contracts rather                            than the eight that Iran had requested to Tehran for signing Ibid                                RG 59 Central Foreign Policy Files                            D7401700979 Irans request for eight contracts is in telegram 4959                            from Tehran June 17 Ibid D7401571036 Ambassador From                        Acting Secretary1 In reftel we informed you of                        arrangements for signing enrichment contracts In talking with GOI officials you should not go beyond                        explanation in that message You should also have the following which is for                        your background only2 AEC is indeed in a serious crunch on                        supply of nuclear fuel Within last few days a veritable flood of requests                        for contracts has hit AEC which at this                        time does not rpt not have capacity to                        fulfill There is some suspicion that several countries have heard that                            AEC capacity was reaching its limits                        and expedited contract requests This problem is intensified by AECs plans to implement Presidential decision                        to turn over the future nuclear fuel enrichment business to the private                        sector Consequently AEC is close to its                        sustaining level of production and cannot meet all its requests We have                        been urgently trying to sort this out but as of now AEC is unable to sign all contracts However                        in light of our special relationship with Iran we have insisted that Iran                        receive special attention and pushed through two contracts3 In addition to this very real supply crunch there are political                        considerations you should be aware of Under normal technical and political                        circumstances we would have moved ahead expeditiously to meet Irans future                        needs for enriched material However our decision to have similar programs                        with Egypt and Israel has aroused strong Congressional and media criticism                        Some Congressional quarters are raising broader issues of greater                        Congressional control over nuclear energy programs and stiffer controls or                        terms such as making ratification of NPT a                        condition for sale of nuclear fuel Indian explosion of course has greatly                        stimulated concern over diversion of plutoniumTelegram 5652 from Tehran July 10 reported that the Iranian                            Government had discussed a nuclearfreezone in the Middle East with the                                UN Secretary General in response to                            the recent Indian nuclear blast and to US agreements to help Egypt                            Israel and Iran develop nuclear power Ibid D7401831118                        These fears have also been fueled by recent spate of articles concerning                        possible insecure storage of nuclear material difficulty of accounting for                        all material etc Articles frequently relate above to potential acquisition                        of explosive devices by criminal or terrorist elements Moreover                        FrenchIranian deal for five power reactors has also complicated                            situationTelegram 5564 from Tehran July 8                            reported that under the FrenchIranian nuclear agreement France would                            provide five 1000megawatt nuclear power stations training of Iranian                            personnel and consultancy services Enrichment services had not been                            negotiated but were also likely to be provided Ibid                            D74018006324 In view of this climate we would have preferred await calmer time for                        going ahead with Iran but AEC deadline of                        June 30 for signing contracts made this course impossible We are                        therefore proceeding with Iran on limited basis of two contracts In                        addition to real supply crunch noted above it was our judgment that to                        authorize eight contracts at this time would have overloaded Congressional                        circuit and jeopardized all our nuclear energy programs in ME In effect we have been caught in double                        bind of supply limitations and political climate here We shall move ahead                        with other contracts when this is feasible It is possible some of current                        media and Congressional criticism and concerns will now focus on Iran We                        shall do our best to forestall or minimize and are consulting carefully with                        key Congressional figures5 We have decided that Israeli and Egyptian agreements should contain                        certain bilateral controls in addition to regular IAEA safeguards It has                        now been decided that Iranian agreement for cooperation should also contain                        these additional bilateral controls: A US veto over availability                        disposition and storage of the plutonium generated by the reactors B a                        commitment by each party to ensure that satisfactory physical security                        arrangements are developed to protect nuclear material from theft and C                        an explicit confirmation by Iran that US material will not be used for                        peaceful nuclear explosions GOI has not                        repeat not been informed of our intention in this regard However this info may break in press within                        next few days as result our consultations on Hill6 Additional bilateral controls should not in our view cause Iran any                        special problems since it has ratified NPT                        and test ban treaties and in current fuss over French newspaper misquotation                        Shah has reaffirmed Iranian policy not acquire nuclear weaponsTelegram 135137 to Tehran June 24 inquired about a Washington Post report of the Shahs interview                            with a French weekly in which he was asked whether Iran would some day                            have nuclear weapons He is quoted as replying without any doubt and                            sooner than one would think Ibid D7401650890 The Embassy

only for Ambassador Stoessel Sub: CSCE: Basket III preamble Ref: State 134543Document 217 and previous1 Subsequent to conversation reported Geneva 3950Document 216 we have had three long and detailed discussions with Soviets concerning Basket III preamble operation culminating in Saturday morning meeting with Kovalev Dubinin and Mendelevich Soviets are pressing hard for simultaneous registration of Finnish language for principle of nonintervention and Basket III preamble by WednesdayJune 26 which we think may be overly ambitious but which we will try our best to help along2 We informed Soviets of our impression that Western group was drifting toward an attitude of treating this whole issue as a key conference item which should not be settled until much later when Soviets have shown what they are willing to concede in terms of Basket III specifics We said that if they hope to conclude this operation quickly some dramatic breakthrough was required which would improve conference atmosphere and make Western and neutral delegations more receptive to the Finnish solution3 The Soviets recognize the need for something dramatic and are apparently prepared to make an effort to register the text on access to printed information by Tuesday in order to provide this element But they insist that the two parts of the Finnish solution must be approved simultaneously and of course this makes the whole project much more difficult We suggested a stepbystep operation: 1 register text on access to printed information 2 register fourth Finnish para of Basket III preamble 3 register Finnish language on legislative and regulatory systems in principle of sovereign equality Soviets said they could not accept this approach without a guarantee that the language in the principles would be accepted We suggested they accept Finnish para 4 for Basket III preamble with specific proviso that this was on condition that satisfactory language would be agreed in the principles They refused and said they had fulfilled their part of the bargain by getting this language introduced by the Finns now it was up to us to fulfill our part of the bargain by getting it approved They were willing to be helpful in this but it was basically a US problem and if it was necessary perhaps an effort in capitals was required4 We indicated that real problem was not eventual satisfactory solution to this issue but trying to achieve it all simultaneously in a very short time in a conference where atmosphere has been getting more and more negative ever since the Easter break primarily because of Soviet resistance to progress on Basket III specifics We were willing to try whatever looked possible but in the circumstances we thought this would be most difficult to accomplish by Wednesday5 At this point Kovalev brought out the text of a new Finnish proposal which he said had been conveyed to Soviets and to the FRG Basket I representative last night Text of Finnish proposal is as followsComponents of a deal to be made between the heads of delegations:1 the fourth sentence of the Finnish proposal to be redrafted as follows: Therefore each of them will not intervene against the political economic and cultural elements of other participating states and will respect the right to determine their laws and regulations2 The above mentioned sentence to be located under the first principle sovereign equality3 The fourth paragraph of the Finnish proposal in the preamble of item III to be accepted4 Assurance by all parties that no safeguard clauses nor any reference to the principles or to laws and regulations will be included in the socalled minipreambles of the Basket IIIWe have no indication yet of FRG or Nine opinion of above proposal6 Kovalev asked for our views on this and we told him that it looked like a useful contribution Language of para 1 would have to be altered to fit context of sovereign equality principle but otherwise it looked promising We cautioned him however that even with this Finnish proposal it would be difficult to complete this whole operation by Wednesday We said that phrase laws and regulations might be more acceptable to some Western delegations than legislative and regulatory systems and suggested that Soviets consider this language as a possible fallback position in case legislative and regulatory systems proved totally unacceptable Soviets said they would convey this suggestion to Moscow and would reflect on this possibility With regard to the paper as a whole they planned to meet with Finns this evening to discuss it more fully Main problem they foresaw was that of finding a mechanism such as an informal meeting of delegation heads at which such a package deal could be agreed in order to have the whole thing approved at once They said they would be back in touch with us and we arranged a further meeting for Sunday June 237 As for Basket III specifics Soviets still realized need to improve conference atmosphere and would try to register the text on access to printed information by Tuesday of next week To assist in this process we arranged a meeting between US and Soviet Basket III reps for Saturday afternoon We plan to advise Soviets on what may be acceptable so Soviets can put forward a workable text on Monday8 FYI: Soviets here appear to be unaware that need for progress on Basket III specifics was ever mentioned to them when original agreement on this problem was reached as indicated in para 1 of State 121749Document 210 This has made our dealings with them considerably more difficult since they take the view that getting the Finnish solution accepted is our sole responsibility End FYIDale	19740622

AND HAS LED TO                            ALLOUT GOP EFFORTS TO SEEK URGENT SECURITY GUARANTEES AND ARMS AID FROM                            MAJOR POWERS FOR INDIA TO SET OFF NUCLEAR DEVICE DESPITE WORLD                            OPPOSITION IS SEEN BY PAKISTAN AS PROOF EVIDENT OF INDIAN INTRANSIGENCE                            AND SOUTH ASIAN HEGEMONIC AMBITIONS GOT BELIVES THAT NOW IS TIME FOR

APPARENT IN CURRENT GOP QUEST FOR SECURITY                            GUARANTEE AND ARMS IS UNDOUBTEDLY GENUINE WE DOUBT PAKS ARE SIMPLY                            PUTTING ON A SHOW IN ORDER TO ADVANCE ANY SUCH OBJECTIVE AS TO                            DEVASTATE US RELATIONS WITH INDIA AND WE QUESTION WHETHER THIS IS A                            FUNDAMENTAL PAK POLICY OBJECTIVE OR WHETHER SOME ADJUSTMENT IN ARMS                            POLICY EG PUTTING PAKISTAN AND INDIA ON SAME BASIS AS OTHER FRIENDS                            AND SELLING ARMS FOR CASH WOULD DEVASTATE INDOUS RELATIONS WHILE                            PAKS OBVIOUSLY HAVE NEVER RELISHED THOUGHT OF OVERLY CORDIAL USINDIA                            RELATIONS WE HAVE SEEN NO EVIDENCE WHATSOEVER THAT BHUTTO REGIME WISHES                            THOSE RELATIONS TO BE AS BAD AS POSSIBLE PAKS HAVE ON MANY OCCASIONS                            SOUGHT TO HAVE US EXERT PRESSURE IN DELHI ON THEIR BEHALF AND WE DOUBT                            THEY CONSIDER THEIR INTERESTS WOULD BE ADVANCED BY DETERIORATION OF                            INDOUS RELATIONS TO POINT WHERE US LOSES ALL INFLUENCE IN DELHI3 WITH REGARD ARMS AID PAKS ARE UNDER NO ILLUSION THAT ADDITIONAL                            CONVENTIONAL EQUIPMENT THEY MAY BE ABLE SECURE WOULD IN ANY WAY PROVIDE                            COMPARABILITY TO INDIAN MILITARY MIGHT INDIAN NUCLEAR TEST HOWEVER HAS FURTHER                            SHARPENED ALREADY PAINFUL GOP AWARENESS THAT MOST OF THEIR MILITARY                            HARDWARE IS WORN AND OBSOLETE IN TERMS OF WHAT NOT ONLY INDIA BUT                            PAKISTANS OTHER NEIGHBORS POSSESS WHILE BHUTTO HAS REJECTED OPPOSITION                            DEMANDS THAT PAKISTAN EMBARK ON ITS OWN NUCLEAR WEAPONS PROGRAM                            PRESSURE WILL BE INTENSE FOR QUALITATIVE IMPROVEMENT IN THE ARMED FORCES                            TO CREATE CREDIBLE DETERRENT AGAINST AT LEAST CONVENTIONAL INDIAN                            MILITARY THREAT4 IT WOULD BE A MATTER OF NO SMALL INTEREST TO LEARN JUST HOW AS STATED                            REFTEL US HAS BEEN MANIPULATED BY THE SMALL REGIONAL POWER OF PAKISTAN                            IT MAY BE NOTED HOWEVER THAT OUR AID RELATIONS WERE NOT ESTABLISHED                            UNTIL EARLY 1950s AND OUR LETHAL ARMS PROGRAM HAS NOW BEEN DEFUNCT FOR                            SOME TEN YEARS WE DID AND WE DO BELIEVE CENTO WAS IMPORTANT TO THE                            UNITED STATES PAKISTAN HAS BEEN AND CONTINUES TO BE IMPORTANT TO THE                            UNITED STATES VISAVIS CHINA RUSSIA IRAN AND THE MIDDLE EAST AS                            REGARDS PAKISTAN BEING ONLY SMALL AND TOTALLY UNIMPORTANT REGIONAL                            POWER THIS MAY BE SO AS FAR AS INDIA IS CONCERNED BUT NOT ALL THAT                            MUCH SO WITH SOME OTHERS IN THE GEOPOLITICAL SCHEME OF THINGS5 IF AS STATED REFTEL THE                            FUNDAMENTAL REASON RELATIONS WITH INDIA ARE IMPROVING IS THAT SINCE 1965                            WE HAVE AT LEAST HAD A POLICY OF NOT SUPPLYING ARMS IN THE SUBCONTINENT                            THEN IT DOES SEEM THAT IMPROVED RELATIONS WERE A LONG TIME COMING ABOUT                            AFTER POLICY ADOPTED RELATIONS IN FACT DETERIORATED SERIOUSLY FOR                            LONG AFTER THE EMBARGO PLACED ON LETHAL MILITARY EQUIPMENT TO PAKISTAN                            AND INDIA IT DOES NOT APPEAR US MILITARY SUPPLY POLICY IN SUBCONTINENT                            HAS HISTORICALLY BEEN DOMINANT FACTOR IN DETERMINING DIRECTION OF                            USINDIAN RELATIONS EVEN THOUGH INDIANS FOR TACTICAL REASONS OFTEN HAVE                            TRIED TO MAKE IT APPEAR SO THUS RELATIONS WERE AT THEIR BEST IN EARLY                            1960S DESPITE FACT USG AT THAT TIME WAS                            STILL PAKISTANS CHIEF SOURCE OF MILITARY EQUIPMENT AND HIT BOTTOM IN                            EARLY 1972 MORE THAN SIX YEARS AFTER WE ADOPTED POLICY OF RESTRICTING                            ARMS SALES TO SUBCONTINENT IF RELATIONS HAVE BEGUN TO IMPROVE ONCE                            MORE IT WOULD SEEM TO US THAT IT MAY BE DUE AS MUCH TO DISSIPATION OF GOIS GOITALONE RESOLVE AND 1972 EUPHORIA INCREASING                            DOMESTIC TROUBLES DISCOVERY THAT MASSIVE FOREIGN AID IS STILL                            NECESSARY AND CONCERN OVER UNDUE DEPENDENCE ON USSR AS IT IS TO PRESENT US ARMS POLICY6 FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE IS OFF COURSE FUNGIBLE THIS WAS WELL UNDERSTOOD                            BY INDIA DURING THE 50S AND EARLY 60S THERE ARE HOWEVER LIMITATIONS                            INASMUCH AS ASIDE FROM RUSSIA CERTAIN TYPES OF EQUIPMENT CAN ONLY BE                            SECURED FROM THE UNITED STATES MORE IMPORTANT THE INTRODUCTION OF                            AMERICAN EQUIPMENT AND TECHNIQUES PROVIDES BOTH A TIE AND LEVERAGE BOTH                            FROM ASSOCIATION AND FROM DEPENDENCY WHICH RECORD SHOWS WE HAVE WELL                            UNDERSTOOD US EQUIPMENT IS NOW MOLDERING AWAY AND BECOMING OF                            INCREASINGLY SMALLER SIGNIFICANCE TO PAKISTAN AS ITS MILITARY BECOMES                            MORE AND MORE CHINAORIENTED OUR VIRTUALLY UNCHANGING POLICY SINCE 1965                            HAS WROUGHT CONSIDERABLE CHANGE IN THE STATUS QUO ANTE WITH RESPECT TO                            OUR MILITARY TIES AND MILITARY LEVERAGE IN PAKISTAN THIS IS DETRIMENTAL                            OF COURSE TO OUR POSITION HERE AND WE QUESTION WHETHER LOSS OF                            INFLUENCE HERE IS REALLY IN BEST INTEREST OF INDIA7 THERE CAN BE NO ARGUMENT WITH STATEMENT IN REFTEL THAT VITAL                            CONSIDERATION IN WAKE OF INDIAN NUCLEAR TEST IS NOT OUR RELATIONS WITH                            PAKISTAN BUT NEED TO PREVENT NUCLEAR PROLIFERATION THERE IS NO REASON                            WHY APPROPRIATE STEPS TO ACHIEVE LATTER WOULD BE INCOMPATIBLE WITH GOOD                            RELATIONS WITH PAKISTAN  QUITE THE CONTRARY NO ONE SHOULD BE MORE                            PLEASED THAN PAKS IF THROUGH US OR MULTILATERAL EFFORTS GOI WERE INDUCED TO BACK UP ITS CLAIM THAT                            NUCLEAR PROGRAM IS SOLELY FOR PEACEFUL PURPOSES BY ITS PLACING PROGRAM                            UNDER SOME FORM OF INTERNATIONAL INSPECTION THIS SHOULD HOWEVER NOT                            BE LOOKED UPON AS LONGTERM GOAL TO BE ATTAINED THROUGH SLOW PROCESS OF                            PERSUASION AND INFORMAL MONITORING BUT RATHER AS MATTER OF GREAT                            URGENCY WHILE IT WILL NO DOUBT TAKE GOI                            CONSIDERABLE TIME TO DEVELOP SOPHISTICATED DELIVERY SYSTEM FOR ITS                            NUCLEAR DEVICE INDIA  AS PAKS NOTE  ALREADY HAS THE DELIVERY SYSTEM                            TO TRANSPORT NUCLEAR DEVICES TO PAKISTANB IT IS NOT THAT THE INDIANS WOULD USE THE BOMB BUT ONLY THAT THEY                            CAN WE IN THE US CAN APPRECIATE FROM OUW OWN HISTORY THE FEELINGS OF                            THOSE WHO HAVE AND THOSE WHO DONT HAVE THE BIG STICK TO WAVE THERE IS                            A SENSE OF URGENCY IN THIS THAT SHOULD NOT BE COOLED THAT IS ONE OF                            MOVING PURPOSEFULLY TO SAVE THE NONPROLIFERATION TREATY INDIA HAS                            BROKEN THE LINE IGNORING THE POSTULATIONS OF THE UN AND MANY WHO LONG AGO COULD EASILY HAVE DONE WHAT INDIA                            HAS NOW DONE WHATEVER THE PEACEFUL PROTESTATIONS INDIA HAS PRODUCED A                            NUCLEAR BOMB WHETHER INDIA WILL PRODUCE A NUCLEAR ARSENAL IS NOT THE                            VITAL RELEVANCY FOR IT CERTAINLY MUST BE HOPED AND BELIEVED THAT THE                            SAME IMPERATIVES WHICH HAVE STAYED THE HANDS OF NUCLEAR CLUB MEMBERS                            SINCE NAGASAKI WILL STAY INDIAS WHAT IS RELEVANT IS THAT INDIA HAS                            PROVIDED AN EXCUSE FOR THE MANY OTHERS WHO CAN READILY DUPLICATE THE                            INDIAN PERFORMANCE TO DO SO WITH POSSIBLE RESULTS THAT CAN ONLY BE IMAGINED9 THE CURRENT SITUATION REQUIRES A THOROUGH AND PROMPT EXAMINATION OF                            IMPLICATIONS INDIAN NUCLEAR TEST PARTICULARLY MEASURES THAT MIGHT BE                            TAKEN TO AVOID FURTHER PROLIFERATION AND TO MINIMIZE DESTABILIZING                            EFFECT OF NUCLEAR TEST ON SITUATION IN SUBCONTINENT QUESTION OF                            POSSIBLE CHANGES IN US ARMS SUPPLY POLICY WOULD CERTAINLY BE A PART OF                            THIS EXAMINATION THE INITIATIVE SHOULD BE OURS WE SHOULD NOT AWAIT                            INDIAS NEXT MOVES FOR WITH ITS RECENT VENTURE IN RAJASTHAN WE HAVE                            ALREADY SEEN MORE THAN WE WOULD WISH TO10 PENULTIMATE PARAGRAPH REFTEL SUGGESTS SECRETARY MIGHT TAKE                            OPPORTUNITY OF HIS IMPENDING VISIT TO PAKISTAN AND INDIA TO PROVIDE                            SUITABLE REASSURANCES TO BHUTTO VISIT WOULD CERTAINLY PROVIDE CHANCE                            TO CONVEY WHATEVER POLICY DECISIONS ARE DERIVED FROM OUR EXAMINATION OF                            RAMIFICATIONS OF NUCLEAR TEST INCLUDING ACTIONS RE PAKISTAN IF ANY ARE                            DECIDED UPON WE DONT HOWEVER SEE VALUE HERE OF REASSURANCES OF TYPE                            SUGGESTED IN REFTEL ALSO VALUE OF ANY REASSURANCES WOULD BE GREATLY                            DIMINISHED IF BHUTTO WERE REQUIRED TO KEEP THEM ABSOLUTELY SECRET QUITE                            APART FROM BHUTTOS OWN CONCERNS OVER INDIAN INTENTIONS HE HAS SERIOUS                            MORALE PROBLEM BOTH WITH PUBLIC AS A WHOLE AND SPECIFICALLY WITH ARMED                            FORCES11 A LOT OF GOOD THINGS HAVE HAPPENED IN PAKISTAN IN THE LAST TWO OR                            THREE YEARS THINGS THAT THOSE WHO CONCERN THEMSELVES WITH AFFAIRS IN                            THE SUBCONTINENT HAVE LONG WISHED TO SEE HAPPEN A TRUNCATED PAKISTAN                            HAS TURNED AWAY FROM MILITARY ROLE INTO PARLIAMENTARY DEMOCRACY UNDER                            CIVIL LEADERSHIP IT ALSO ALL THINGS CONSIDERED HAS BEEN DOING PRETTY                            WELL BOTH DOMESTICALLY AND IN ITS FOREIGN AFFAIRS UNDER BHUTTOS LEADERSHIP IT HAS BEEN                            TURNING FROM THE PREVIOUS STATE OF ALMOST TOTAL BITTER PREOCCUPATION                            WITH INDIA TO AN EXPANSION OF ITS INTEREST IN THE REGION TOWARDS THE                            WEST AND SOUTHWEST IT HAS IN FACT OF LATE BEEN MORE DYNAMIC IN                            ACCELERATION OF IMPROVEMENT OF ITS STATURE AND IMAGE THAN INDIA AND WE                            HAVE TAKEN THE VIEW THAT THIS STATE OF AFFAIRS WOULD MAKE IT EASIER                            RATHER THAN HARDER FOR BHUTTO TO HAVE PUBLIC SUPPORT FOR MOVING FORWARD                            UNDER THE SIMLA PROCESS TO COEXIST WITH INDIA UNDER TOERABLE                            RELATIONSHIPS12 WE WOULD REGRET VERY MUCH TO SEE A REVERSAL OF ALL THIS WHICH WE                            BELIEVE WOULD BE NO MORE IN THE LONG RANGE INTERESTS OF INDIA THAN                            OURSELVES WE ALSO BELIEVE IT VERY MUCH IN THE

special session of the UNGA assess attitudes of delegations as they return and analyze effect on host governments of actions toward or within NACG NonAligned Conference Group the Embassy provided a strategy for influencing Nepal a moderate nonaligned state	:NONALIGNED ACTIVITIES IN INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS: NEPAL	1974-06-24 03:01:00	None	None	TELEGRAM Department of State KATHMANDU 2549EO 11652: GDS TAGS: PFOR NP UNACTION: SecState WASHDCINFO: AmEmbassy New DelhiUSUN AmCon HONG KONG USLO PEKINGKATHMANDU 2549REF:A STATE 099106B KATHMANDU 2099C KATHMANDU 13881 SUMMARY Nonalignment and association with NonAligned Conference Group                        NACG are fundamental elements of Nepals foreign policy As moderate and                        pragmatic member of NACG Nepal uses its limited influence in direction of                        more balanced positions GON is receptive to US views on many issues                        particularly desirability of mitigating extremist tendencies in NACG To the                        degree we can persuade GON that these                        extremists are creating undesirable precedents or operation effective                        operation of multilateral institutions we may be able to influence it to                            dissociate itself from                        particularly radical NACG positions but Nepal will not wish to be isolated                        from mainstream of nonaligned thinking In addition on most issues where                        its two giant neighbors China and India are in agreement Nepal considers                        its freedom of maneuver limited and will be cautious in taking which would                        antagonize either neighbor END SUMMARY2 Although one of the more moderate and pragmatic of NACC members Nepal has                        increasingly acceded publicly and in multilateral fora to extremist NACG                        positions and tactics GON has also                        acquiesced in consensus approach to NAGG decisionmaking and has expressed                        concern with extremist views only privately or as unacknowledged                        reservations within NACG meetings Nepal is ambivalent in its attitudes                        towards NACG which in name if not substance epitomizes Nepals                        traditional and entrenched nonaligned foreign policy It would feel                        isolated and somehow less nonaligned if it were not NACG participant                        Through NACG association where it is member of recently constituted                        Coordinating Bureau and four nation LDC team to negotiate on oil prices with                        Arabs Nepal has gained international publicity foreign and domestic                        prestige and close association with at least some likeminded states At the                        same time GON leadership is uneasy about                        extremist tactics as employed in NACG and some of the results produced to                        the extent that it has apparently even considered pulling out RefTel C3 We do not consider it likely that GON                        will in fact pull out of NACG Indeed presence of relatively moderate                        Nepal in NACG is in our                        interests The problem we face is one of how to reinforce moderate                        tendencies in GON policy in face of cohesive                        tactics of more radical third world countries and Nepals concern for                        sensitivities of its two giant neighborsChina and India In the past with                        the exception of Middle East issues Nepal has been reluctant to take                        positions greatly at variance with those of her neighbors or with                        nonaligned consensus and we should not have unrealistic expectations of                        independent action by small isolated insecure state such as Nepal when                        third world issues are at stake4 We concur that steps outlined para four RefTel A are very much in order From Kathmandu perspective we                        suggest major us effort to help the moderates of the NACG to identify issues                        where they have interests in common in the hope that a moderate group might                        eventually coalesce to challenge extremist control in NACG In our tactics                        in dealing with the moderates we should make clear that we do not find                        nonalignment objectionable per se but that this is a lapse in congruity in                        applying the appellation of nonaligned to a grouping which is demonstrably                        led by committed extremists In addition we should bear down hard with                        moderate members of NACG wherever we can convincingly demonstrate that                        precedents being created by NACG strongarm tactics are harmful to                        specific third party interests For example many countries including                        Nepal face serious threats from exile claimants to power like Nepal                        Congress Party dissidents in India and hence support for GRUNK or PRG is                        adverse to their interests In                        addition we must prepare for horsetrading at international conferences with                        groupings within the NACG On basis of our recent discussions with GON on LOS it                        appears that landlocked states like Nepal may be willing to go along with                        some points Of strategic and economic importance to US if they receive in                        return support on issues of key interest to landlocked countries RefTel KATHMANDU 22255 We are lees certain about proposed tradeoff between economic assistance                        and political support It may be desirable as suggested paras 4c  e                        to adjust our positions on resource transfer to developing nations and to                        demonstrate greater flexibility in this area Unfortunately most third                        world countries believe that accelerated resource transfer through                        international organizations is already their due and they are unlikely to                        make compensating political gestures in return Attempts to bring about                        changes in also political posture on specific issue by withholding aid is                        also unlikely to be productive in it increasingly nationalistic country such                        as Nepal Indeed direct USG pressure of                        this kind is more likely to antagonize GON                        than to induce greater flexibility on its part Instead we would strongly                        recommend wherever possible that we seek to mobilize other small Asian                        states behind particular issues of importance to us Nepal an more easily be                        influenced by its neighbors and by other states in similar geopolitical                        situations than it can by external great powers6 In sum problem of radicalization of nonaligned countries is one which we can influence somewhat                        but within limits The sense of solidarity among third world countries is                        growing Nepal feeling insecure in its geopolitical situation is unlikely                        to put much distance between itself and the nonaligned consensus unless it                        can be convinced that divergent position is clearly in its national                        interestCARGO WIC initialed	19740624

EVERYBODY                            RUSHES FORWARD WITH IDEAS ON HOW TO CONTRIBUTE WHEN AID IS GOING DOWN                            TOWARD TERMINATION EVERYBODY WANTS TO BE THE FIRST ONE OUT SINCE
