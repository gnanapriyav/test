frus1969-76v28d176	176 Telegram From Secretary of State Kissinger to the Embassy in France	None	1976-02-14 22:15:00	None	None	Secto 3022 For the Ambassador from                            the Secretary Subj: France Plans to Recognize MPLA1 I am extremely disturbed by Sauvagnargues letter indicating that French recognition                            of the MPLA is imminentNot found I can appreciate that France has                            more at stake than many countries wishes to keep in step with its                            former African colonies and feels vulnerable because it has been                            involved with us in aiding the antiMPLA forces in Angola There is little point in wasting                            political capital with a close ally if the effort seems pointless But I                            would hope that France might postpone its action for about a week until                            at least we have thought through our own position and been able to                            convey it to our friends in Africa and coordinate with our friends in                            Europe2 In transmitting my letter below on an urgent basis you should explore                            with Sauvagnargues the                            possibility of postponing recognition in order to apply maximum pressure                            on the MPLA to make concessions to the                            view point of half of Africa and much of Europe You should stress with                            him that in our belief there is an inherent contradiction between the                            French Governments proposed assertion to the MPLA that it                            attaches le plus grand prix to SovietCuban withdrawal and its hasty                            unconditional recognition You should also stress that his move destroys                            the possibility for any meaningful approach to the MPLA by the countries of Africa and the                            world which are very prepared to see the MPLA lead an Angolan government but not as a SovietCuban                            satellite3 You may tell Sauvagnargues that                            we are in the process of refining a policy toward Angola designed to                            bring maximum pressure to bear on the MPLA to make some concessions using arguments of                            persuasion as much as withholding recognition and cooperation We need a                            few days however to launch a new policy which we believe will be much                            more effective than any sauve qui peut policy of hasty recognition at                            least in limiting the damage inflicted on the Western position in Africa                            and around the world by our evident loss of will to stand up to a                            blatant SovietCuban power play4 If it seems clear to you that there is no way to postpone recognition                            in any meaningful fashion then the main thrust of your more in sorrow                               remarks should be on the need for close consultation in the                            future and cooperation in bolstering the shaky position of our                            remaining African friends5 Begin text: Dear Jean:Your letter announcing Frances intention to recognize the Luanda regime                            reached me at a time when Angolan circumstances have filled me with deep                            concern and regret I can only agree with you that we draw quite                            different conclusions from rather similar analyses of the situationThe instant response of your government to the military victories secured                            on behalf of a minority regime by a Cuban expeditionary force                            encouraged and equipped by Moscow will I fear only help to drive home                            the lesson we have sought to avoidthat Communist intervention on behalf                            of Marxist allies in conflicts in the developing world is a paying                            propositionIt has seemed to me that we could create a scenario including aid to the                            neighboring states of Zaire and Zambia which would have allowed the                            West to bargain its recognition and cooperation in exchange for concrete                            concessions in the area of Soviet and Cuban withdrawal and the                            establishment of some more representative government But if we                            recognize first and then ask for concessions we are in the weak                            position of being a demandeur intervening in the internal affairs of a                            state we already recognize And as you imply very correctly in your                            letter separate acts of recognition only serve to weaken the impact we                            might hope to achieve with such recognition through a more coordinated                            and hardbargaining postureIn our intense dialogue about Angola with many African leaders some of                            them very close to France we have found a strong desire to do something                            constructive to strengthen the forces opposed to the MPLA and to protect moderate states from                            the sort of radical interference in their internal affairs exemplified                            by Angola I am afraid that your action will not seem responsive to                            their concerns But ultimately of course I recognize France must do                            what it considers to be in its best longterm interestI can agree with you that continued insurgency will tend to prolong a                            Soviet and Cuban presence in Angola If you feel that French interests                            require such rapid recognition then I can only urge you not to throw                            away your influence by recognizing firstand then negotiating with empty                            hands Could you not at least probe to see what concrete assurances you                            can elicit regarding the withdrawal of the SovietCuban expeditionary                            force and steps toward a government of national reconciliationI need hardly tell you that Western credibility has suffered grievously                            as a result of US inability to come to the aid of moderate forces in                            Angola and general Western European reluctance to get involved I would                            like at least to thank France for having done more than any other                            European country to prevent what we see now happening It seems to me                            that if we are to contain the damage caused by what amounts to a                            Western defeat then we must make early and serious moves to provide                            additional economic and military aid to the countries neighboring                            Angola who remain our friends for the time being and which have been                            made so vulnerable by the MPLA                            victory We will still wish to discuss this containment aspect of our                            Angolan policy with youIn the meantime we are working out a policy which we believe will                            provide us with more bargaining power in dealing with the MPLA than one of simple acquiescence in a                            SovietCuban victory I would sincerely hope that your government might                            find its way clear to postpone any final decision on recognition for                            about a week giving us time to consult with our friends and allies and                            develop a more coherent regional containment strategyWhatever your final decision thank you for allowing me the opportunity                            to comment on your forthcoming decision I hope that we can remain in                            close touch on the Angolan question even if our policies should now                            divergeNancy is better and joins me in sending warm regards Henry End textKissinger	19760214
frus1969-76v28d177	177 Telegram From the Embassy in France to the Department of State	None	1976-02-16 15:58:00	None	None	4652 For the Secretary from the Ambassador Subject: France Plans to                            Recognize MPLA Ref: Secto 03022Document 176Summary:Sauvagnargues received me at noon                            February 16 for review of Angola situation I argued that it is                            important that we not give up our trump of diplomatic recognition                            precipitously before seeking to exercise maximum leverage on MPLA At least we should wait a minimum                            time to develop a joint approach to the problem of the SovietCuban                            presence Sauvagnargues agreed                            that our objective in Angola is the samestimulate Africas natural                            tendency to reject foreign domination But Sauvagnargues disagreed with our analysis of how to do                            it Recognition of reality of MPLA                            victory Sauvagnargues feels                            gives us opportunity to begin working with MPLA to encourage their taking distance from Soviets                            Refusal to recognize only keeps the MPLA locked into SovietCuban embrace In addition                                Giscard has already made                            commitment to African moderates that France will recognize MPLA so as not to leave Houphouet and                                Ahidjo among others all alone                            and unsupported Sauvagnargues                            agreed that while we disagree on recognition tactics we must continue                            coordinating our efforts to bolster Zambia and Zaire to keep moderates                            on our side and to encourage African nationalism and moderation within                            the MPLA End                                summary1 Sauvagnargues began by reading                            your letter reftel I followed                            that up with the argument that we must maintain maximum pressure on                                MPLA by holding back recognition                            until we can prepare an appropriate program of containment for the                            Angola area By conceding recognition first we weaken our position and                            give the MPLA every incentive to                            maintain their solidarity with the Cubans If we withhold recognition                            we give the MPLA a reason to begin                            separating themselves from the Cubans and Soviets and give the moderate                            Africans and Europeans time to work out a plan designed to weaken the                            Soviet position2 Sauvagnargues replied that the                            situation is both delicate and complicated Like the USG France is not anxious to recognize a                            fait accompli in Angola But                            from that point the French analysis differs from ours The MPLA victory is a reality Western                            options are limited Support for a guerilla war is out of the question                            It would only prolong the fighting and deepen the Soviet involvement by                            maintaining MPLA dependence                            Essentially we have a choice between recognizing the MPLA first and bargaining afterward or                            bargaining first and recognizing afterward Sauvagnargues said that if we attempt to bargain first                            we really do not have the leverage we think we do We worked against the                                MPLA and the MPLA knows that we worked against them                            Our refusal to recognize the MPLA will                            have absolutely no effect beyond driving them more deeply into Soviet                            dependency3 Even more central than the previous arguments Sauvagnargues emphasized is the                            position of the African moderates Earlier we asked the moderates to be                            hard on the MPLA and they responded                            positively Now the Ivory Coast and Cameroon have recognized Even                                Mobutu told Giscard in a recent message that he                            has no objection to France recognizing the MPLA All Mobutu                            asks is a guarantee that the MPLA not                            unleash the Katangese gendarmes The African moderates supported us when                            we needed them We cannot let them down now We must stay with them In                            fact Giscard wanted to announce                            recognition of the MPLA on Saturday                            but agreed to consult first with the US UK and the FRG In effect                                Giscard has made a                            commitment to Houphouet to join in the recognition of the MPLA4 Finally Sauvagnargues said                            that if there is any chance that Neto and the moderates in the MPLA will distance themselves from the Soviets it is                            important that we start working to stimulate this natural African reflex                            right away This can only be done through recognition and communications                            with the MPLA5 I told Sauvagnargues that it is                            clear we agree on fundamental objectives We just differ on the                            potential effect of recognition I suggested that the GOF take some time to reflect and allow us                            time to come up with a broad plan of action that would protect our                            position with our African friends6 Sauvagnargues then argued that                            the act of recognition is not all that significant We must separate the                            act of recognition from the real leverage we can exercise on the MPLA which will come from their need for                            a Western economic presence I countered by pointing out that quick                            recognition will only give the MPLA                            the feeling they can get what they want from the West without ejecting                            the Soviets Sauvagnargues argued                            back that the use of recognition as a bargaining lever has never worked                            especially when the object of the exercise has just won a military                            victory to come to power When Angola was discussed by the Big Four Foreign Ministers in                                BrusselsSee footnote 5 Document 147Sauvagnargues said a prolonged                            armed resistance was expected This did not come about and the issue of                            recognition is no longer relevant Moreover Giscard has made a commitment to                            Houphouet and GOF recognition really                            cannot wait Sauvagnargues said                            he was impressed by the Brazilians who told him that the MPLA will quickly understand that Soviet                            assistance is cumbersome and will be looking for a way out through                            contacts with the West7 In conclusion I argued that the GOF                            should give Washington at least a weeks leeway to develop a plan that                            will help us pursue our common objective in Angola Sauvagnargues said he would transmit                            our request and arguments to Giscard but did not feel that the President would                            reverse his decision He stressed however his complete agreement with                            the need to develop a coordinated approach to an MPLAruled Angola especially the                            requirement that Zambia and Zaire be bolstered both economically and                            militarily8 Comment: I do not see much hope that Giscard will reverse his decision to                            recognize the MPLA within the next day                            or so Apart from his disagreement with us on the impact of recognition                                Giscards commitment to the                            moderate Africans is crucial to this decision I feel however that we                            can continue to work closely and effectively with the French on efforts                            to encourage the MPLA regime to                            separate themselves from the Cubans and SovietsRush	19760216

Following is a nonverbatim summary of the Counselors discussion of this                    subject to the EUR Chiefs of Mission meeting in                    London in mid December It is intended for your background guidance and that of                    your senior staff and is not to be used directly in your talks with host                    government2 Begin Summary We are witnessing the emergence of the                    Soviet Union as a super power on a global scale This will be a longterm                    process It is a process that is just beginning in global terms as the Soviets                    are just now breaking out of their continental mold They are just now                    developing modalities for carrying out such a global policy3 The reason why it is possible for the United States and its Western European                    allies to develop the policies that will allow us to cope with this situation is                    that Soviet power is developing irregularly It is subject to flaws and to                    requirements which in some cases only the outside world can meet4 Their thrust as an imperial power comes at a time well after that period when                    the last imperial power Germany made the plunge and it hence comes at a time                    when different rules and perceptions apply The Soviets have been inept They                    have not been able to bring the attractions that past imperial powers brought to                    their conquests They have not brought the ideological legal cultural                    architectural organizational and other values and skills that characterized the                    British French and German adventures5 In addition there are serious underlying pressures and tensions in the Soviet                    system itself The base from which imperialism asserts itself has serious                    problems in the economic and social sectors There are also internal nationalist                    groups which are growing NonRussian nationalist groups in Russia are growing                    at a disproportionally faster rate which will add to these tensions in the base                    whence springs Soviet imperialism6 The Soviets have been particularly unskilled in building viable international                    structures They have nothing approaching the European Community or the many other successful Western                    institutions In Eastern Europe particularly the single most important unifying                    force is the presence of sheer Soviet military power There has been no                    development of a more viable organic structure If anything the last thirty                    years have intensified the urges in Eastern European countries for autonomy for                    identity There has been an intensification of the desire to break out of the                    Soviet straitjacket This has happened in every Eastern European country to one                    degree or another There are almost no genuine friends of the Soviets left in                    Eastern Europe except possibly Bulgaria7 The Soviets inability to acquire loyalty in Eastern Europe is an unfortunate                    historical failure because Eastern Europe is within their scope and area of                    natural interest It is doubly tragic that in this area of vital interest and                    crucial importance it has not been possible for the Soviet Union to establish                    roots of interest that go beyond sheer power8 It is therefore important to remember that the main if not the only                    instrument of Soviet imperialism has been power9 The reason we can today talk and think in terms of dealing with Soviet                    imperialism outside of and in addition to simple confrontation is precisely                    because Soviet power is emerging in such a flawed way This gives us the time to                    develop and to react There is no way to prevent the emergence of the Soviet                    Union as a superpower What we can do is affect the way in which that power is                    developed and used Not only can we balance it in the traditional sense but we                    can affect its usageand that is what dtente is all about10 It is often asked how dtente is doing The question itself evades the                    central issue we are trying to pose That is what do you do in the face of                    increasing Soviet power We will be facing this increased power if our                    relationship with the Russians is sweet or our relationship with the Russians is                    sour The day when the US could choose its preferences from two alternatives                    is over: that is turning our back on the worldusually behind the protection of                    another power like the British Navyor changing the world That choice no longer                    exists for us There is too much power in the world for us to ignore not just                    the Soviets but other industrial powers raw material producers and even the                    combined political power of the dwarf states Nor do we today have enough power                    to simply overwhelm these problems11 So the Soviets will be seen and heard on the world stage no matter what we                    do Therefore the question of whether or not dtente is up or down at a                    particular moment is largely irrelevant We Americans like to keep score cards                    but the historic challenge of the Soviet Union will not go away and the problem                    of coping with the effects of that growing Soviet power also wont go away We                    dont have any alternative except to come to grips with the various forms of                    power which surround us in the world                    We have to get away from seeing dtente as a process which appeases or                    propitiates Soviet power We have to see our task as managing or domesticating                    this power That is our central problem in the years ahead not finding                    agreements to sign or atmospheres to improve although those have some effect                    Our challenge is how to live in a world with another super power and anticipate                    the arrival of a third super power China in twenty years or so12 The debate in the United States on dtente is illustrated by comments that                    Soviet trade is a oneway street It seems that today you cant just get payment                    for the goods you sellyou must get Jewish emigration or arms restraint or any                    number of other things13 Our European friends have extended considerable credit to the Soviets and                    Eastern European countries while the US does                    not extend lines of credit but rather approves financing on the basis of each                    project That feature gives us some control over the direction of Soviet                    economic development The Europeans have surrendered on this point While not                    falling into the trade trap we have seen trade as a set of instrumentalities to                    address the set of problems we face with the Soviets We have to find a way to                    develop a coherent trade strategy that goes beyond the commercial views of                    individual firms14 The grain agreement is a good but narrow example of what I am talking about                    The Soviets were forced to accept that they need substantial imports from the                    United States That gives us leverage but only if it is done within a coherent                    framework of policies to achieve certain objectives MFN has been considered a concession to the USSR and in a sense it is The Soviets dont                    like paying interestthey prefer to earn their way as they go If this is an                    accurate assessment then with MFN and credit                    policies we can get the USSR to be                    competitively engaged in our US markets If done                    skillfully this forces them to meet the requirements of the sophisticated                        US market MFN entry into US markets can have                    an impact on Soviet behavior This is not a trivial matter15 It is in our longterm interests to use these strengths to break down the                    autarkic nature of the USSR There are                    consumer choices being made in the USSR that                    although more below the surface than those in the United States can be                    exploited This is just one illustration There are many assets in the West in                    this area and instead of looking at them as just commercial sales we need to be                    using them to draw the Soviet Union into a series of dependencies and ties with                    the West It is a longterm project16 When we lost the MFN battle with Congress                    we lost our ability to impose a degree of discipline on the Soviet Union as we                    were able to do in the case of the grain deal This is the real tragedy of                    losing that trade issue In the longterm we have suffered a setback17 With regard to Eastern Europe it must be in our longterm interest to                    influence events in this areabecause of the present unnatural relationship with                    the Soviet Unionso that they will not sooner or later explode causing WW III                    This inorganic unnatural relationship is a far greater danger to world peace                    than the conflict between East and West There is one qualification to this                    statement If Western Europe becomes so concerned with its economic and social                    problems that an imbalance develops then perhaps the dangers to the United                    States interests will be endangered by the simple change in the balance of                    power18 So it must be our policy to strive for an evolution that makes the                    relationship between the Eastern Europeans and the Soviet Union an organic one                    Any excess of zeal on our part is bound to produce results that could reverse                    the desired process for a period of time even though the process would remain                    inevitable within the next 100 years But of course for us that is too long a                    time to wait19 So our policy must be a policy of responding to the clearly visible                    aspirations in Eastern Europe for a more autonomous existence within the context                    of a strong Soviet geopolitical influence This has worked in Poland The Poles                    have been able to overcome their romantic political inclinations which led to                    their disasters in the past They have been skillful in developing a policy that                    is satisfying their needs for a national identity without arousing Soviet                    reactions It is a long process20 A similar process is now going on in Hungary Janos Kadars performance has                    been remarkable in finding ways which are acceptable to the Soviet Union which                    develop Hungarian roots and the natural aspirations of the people He has                    conducted a number of experiments in the social and economic areas To a large                    degree he has been able to do this because the Soviets have four divisions in                    Hungary and therefore have not been overly concerned He has skillfully used                    their presence as a security blanket for the Soviets in a way that has been                    advantageous to the development of his own country21 The Romanian picture is different as one would expect from their different                    history The Romanians have striven for autonomy but they have been less daring                    and innovative in their domestic systems They remain among the most rigid                    countries in the internal organization of their system22 We seek to influence the emergence of the Soviet imperial power by making the                    base more natural and organic so that it will not remain founded in sheer power                    alone But there is no alternative open to us other than that of influencing the                    way Soviet power is used23 Finally on Yugoslavia We and the Western Europeans indeed the Eastern                    Europeans as well have an interest which borders on the vital for us in                    continuing the independence of Yugoslavia from Soviet domination Of course we                    accept that Yugoslav behavior will continue to be as it has been in the past influenced and                    constrained by Soviet power but any shift back by Yugoslavia into the Soviet                    orbit would represent a major strategic setback for the West So we are                    concerned about what will happen when Tito disappears and it is worrying us a good deal24 So our basic policy continues to be that which we have pursued since 194849                    keeping Yugoslavia in a position of substantial independence from the Soviet                    Union Now at the same time we would like them to be less obnoxious and we                    should allow them to get away with very little We should especially disabuse                    them of any notion that our interest in their relative independence is greater                    than their own and therefore they have a free rideEnd SummaryKissinger	19760201

IN YOUR TALKS WITH HOST GOVERNMENT2 BEGIN SUMMARY WE ARE WITNESSING THE EMERGENCE OF THE SOVIET UNION AS                            A SUPER POWER ON A GLOBAL SCALE THIS WILL BE A LONGTERM PROCESS IT IS                            A PROCESS THAT IS JUST BEGINNING IN GLOBAL TERMS AS THE SOVIETS ARE JUST                            NOW BREAKING OUT OF THEIR CONTINENTAL MOLD THEY ARE JUST NOW DEVELOPING                            MODALITIES FOR CARRYING OUT SUCH A GLOBAL POLICY3 THE REASON WHY IT IS POSSIBLE FOR THE UNITED STATES AND ITS WESTERN                            EUROPEAN ALLIES TO DEVELOP THE POLICIES THAT WILL ALLOW US TO COPE WITH                            THIS SITUATION IS THAT SOVIETSECRET PAGE 02 STATE 024976POWER IS DEVELOPING IRREGULARLY IT IS SUBJECT TO FLAWS AND TO                            REQUIREMENTS WHICH IN SOME CASES ONLY THE OUTSIDE WORLD CAN MEET4 THEIR THRUST AS AN IMPERIAL POWER COMES AT A TIME WELL AFTER THAT                            PERIOD WHEN THE LAST IMPERIAL POWER GERMANY MADE THE PLUNGE AND IT                            HENCE COMES AT A TIME WHEN DIFFERENT RULES AND PERCEPTIONS APPLY THE                            SOVIETS HAVE BEEN INEPT THEY HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO BRING THE                            ATTRACTIONS THAT PAST IMPERIAL POWERS BROUGHT TO THEIR CONQUESTS THEY                            HAVE NOT BROUGHT THE IDEOLOGICAL LEGAL CULTURAL ARCHITECTURAL                            ORGANIZATIONAL AND OTHER VALUES AND SKILLS THAT CHARACTERIZED THE                            BRITISH FRENCH AND GERMAN ADVENTURES5 IN ADDITION THERE ARE SERIOUS UNDERLYING PRESSURES AND TENSIONS IN                            THE SOVIET SYSTEM ITSELF THE BASE FROM WHICH IMPERIALISM ASSERTS ITSELF                            HAS SERIOUS PROBLEMS IN THE ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL SECTORS THERE ARE ALSO                            INTERNAL NATIONALIST GROUPS WHICH ARE GROWING NONRUSSIAN NATIONALIST                            GROUPS IN RUSSIA ARE GROWING AT A DISPROPORTIONALLY FASTER RATE WHICH                            WILL ADD TO THESE TENSIONS IN THE BASE WHENCE SPRINGS SOVIET                            IMPERIALISM6 THE SOVIETS HAVE BEEN PARTICULARLY UNSKILLED IN BUILDING VIABLE                            INTERNATIONAL STRUCTURES THEY HAVE NOTHING APPROACHING THE EUROPEAN                            COMMUNITY OR THE MANY OTHER SUCCESSFUL WESTERN INSTITUTIONS IN EASTERN                            EUROPE PARTICULARLY THE SINGLE MOST IMPORTANT UNIFYING FORCE IS THE                            PRESENCE OF SHEER SOVIET MILITARY POWER THERE HAS BEEN NO DEVELOPMENT                            OF A MORE VIABLE ORGANIC STRUCTURE IF ANYTHING THE LAST THIRTY YEARS                            HAVE INTENSIFIED THE URGES IN EASTERN EUROPEAN COUNTRIES FOR AUTONOMY                            FOR IDENTITY THERE HAS BEEN AN INTENSIFICATION OF THE DESIRE TO BREAK                            OUT OF THE SOVIET STRAITJACKET THIS HAS HAPPENED IN EVERY EASTERN                            EUROPEAN COUNTRY TO ONE DEGREE OR ANOTHER THERE ARE ALMOST NO GENUINE                            FRIENDS OF THE SOVIETS LEFT IN EASTERN EUROPE EXCEPT POSSIBLY                            BULGARIA7 THE SOVIETS INABILITY TO ACQUIRE LOYALTY IN EASTERNSECRETPAGE 03 STATE 024976EUROPE IS AN UNFORTUNATE HISTORICAL FAILURE BECAUSE EASTERN EUROPE IS                            WITHIN THEIR SCOPE AND AREA OF NATURAL INTEREST IT IS DOUBLY TRAGIC                            THAT IN THIS AREA OF VITAL INTEREST AND CRUCIAL IMPORTANCE IT HAS NOT                            BEEN POSSIBLE FOR THE SOVIET UNION TO ESTABLISH ROOTS OF INTEREST THAT                            GO BEYOND SHEER POWER8 IT IS THEREFORE IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER THAT THE MAIN IF NOT THE                            ONLY INSTRUMENT OF SOVIET IMPERIALISM HAS BEEN POWER9 THE REASON WE CAN TODAY TALK AND THINK IN TERMS OF DEALING WITH SOVIET                            IMPERIALISM OUTSIDE OF AND IN ADDITION TO SIMPLE CONFRONTATION IS                            PRECISELY BECAUSE SOVIET POWER IS EMERGING IN SUCH A FLAWED WAY THIS                            GIVES US THE TIME TO DEVELOP AND TO                            REACT THERE IS NO WAY TO PREVENT THE EMERGENCE OF THE SOVIET UNION AS A                            SUPERPOWER WHAT WE CAN DO IS AFFECT THE WAY IN WHICH THAT POWER IS                            DEVELOPED AND USED NOT ONLY CAN WE BALANCE IT IN THE TRADITIONAL SENSE                            BUT WE CAN AFFECT ITS USAGE  AND THAT IS WHAT DETENTE IS ALL                            ABOUT10 IT IS OFTEN ASKED HOW DETENTE IS DOING THE QUESTION ITSELF EVADES                            THE CENTRAL ISSUE WE ARE TRYING TO POSE THAT IS WHAT DO YOU DO IN THE                            FACE OF INCREASING SOVIET POWER WE WILL BE FACING THIS INCREASED POWER                            IF OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH THE RUSSIANS IS SWEET OR OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH                            THE RUSSIANS IS SOUR THE DAY WHEN THE US COULD CHOOSE ITS PREFERENCES                            FROM TWO ALTERNATIVES IS OVER: THAT IS TURNING OUR BACK ON THE WORLD                             USUALLY BEHIND THE PROTECTION OF ANOTHER POWER LIKE THE BRITISH NAVY                             OR CHANGING THE WORLD THAT CHOICE NO LONGER EXISTS FOR US THERE IS TOO MUCH POWER IN THE WORLD FOR                                US TO IGNORE NOT JUST THE SOVIETS                            BUT OTHER INDUSTRIAL POWERS RAW MATERIAL PRODUCERS AND EVEN THE                            COMBINED POLITICAL POWER OF THE DWARF STATES NOR DO WE TODAY HAVE                            ENOUGH POWER TO SIMPLY OVERWHELM THESE PROBLEMS11 SO THE SOVIETS WILL BE SEEN AND HEARD ON THE WORLD STAGE NO MATTER                            WHAT WE DO THEREFORE THE QUESTION OF WHETHER OR NOT DETENTE IS UP OR                            DOWN AT A PARTICULARSECRETPAGE 04 STATE 024976MOMENT IS LARGELY IRRELEVANT WE AMERICANS LIKE TO KEEP SCORE CARDS BUT                            THE HISTORIC CHALLENGE OF THE SOVIET UNION WILL NOT GO AWAY AND THE                            PROBLEM OF COPING WITH THE EFFECTS OF THAT GROWING SOVIET POWER ALSO                            WONT GO AWAY WE DONT HAVE ANY ALTERNATIVE EXCEPT TO COME TO GRIPS                            WITH THE VARIOUS FORMS OF POWER WHICH SURROUND US IN THE WORLD WE HAVE TO GET AWAY FROM SEEING DETENTE AS                            A PROCESS WHICH APPEASES OR PROPITIATES SOVIET POWER WE HAVE TO SEE OUR                            TASK AS MANAGING OR DOMESTICATING THIS POWER THAT IS OUR CENTRAL                            PROBLEM IN THE YEARS AHEAD NOT FINDING AGREEMENTS TO SIGN OR                            ATMOSPHERES TO IMPROVE ALTHOUGH THOSE HAVE SOME EFFECT OUR CHALLENGE                            IS HOW TO LIVE IN A WORLD WITH ANOTHER SUPER POWER AND ANTICIPATE THE                            ARRIVAL OF A THIRD SUPER POWER CHINA IN TWENTY YEARS OR SO12 THE DEBATE IN THE UNITED STATES ON DETENTE IS ILLUSTRATED BY COMMENTS                            THAT SOVIET TRADE IS A ONEWAY STREETIT SFEMS THAT TODAY YOU CANT JUST GET PAYMENT FOR THE GOODS YOU SELL                             YOU MUST GET JEWISH EMIGRATION OR ARMS RESTRAINT OR ANY NUMBER OF                            OTHER THINGS13 OUR EUROPEAN FRIENDS HAVE EXTENDED CONSIDERABLE CREDIT TO THE SOVIETS                            AND EASTERN EUROPEAN COUNTRIES WHILE THE US DOES NOT EXTEND LINES OF CREDIT BUT RATHER APPROVES                            FINANCING ON THE BASIS OF EACH PROJECT THAT FEATURE GIVES US SOME CONTROL OVER THE DIRECTION OF SOVIET                            ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT THE EUROPEANS HAVE SURRENDERED ON THIS POINT                            WHILE NOT FALLING INTO THE TRADE TRAP WE HAVE SEEN TRADE AS A SET OF                            INSTRUMENTALITIES TO ADDRESS THE SET OF PROBLEMS WE FACE WITH THE                            SOVIETS WE HAVE TO FIND A WAY TO DEVELOP A COHERENT TRADE STRATEGY THAT                            GOES BEYOND THE COMMERCIAL VIEWS OF INDIVIDUAL FIRMS14 THE GRAIN AGREEMENT IS A GOOD BUT NARROW EXAMPLE OF WHAT I AM TALKING                            ABOUT THE SOVIETS WERE FORCED TO ACCEPT THAT THEY NEED SUBSTANTIAL                            IMPORTS FROM THE UNITED STATES THAT GIVES US LEVERAGE BUT ONLY IF IT                            IS DONE WITHIN A COHERENT FRAMEWORK OF POLICIES TO ACHIEVE CERTAIN                            OBJECTIVES MFN HASSECRETPAGE 05 STATE 024976BEEN CONSIDERED A CONCESSION TO THE USSR AND IN A SENSEE IT IS THE SOVIETS DONT LIKE PAYING                            INTEREST  THEY PREFER TO EARN THEIR WAY AS THEY GO IF THIS IS AN                            ACCURATE ASSESSMENT THEN WITH MFN AND                            CREDIT POLICIES WE CAN GET THE USSR TO                            BE COMPETITIVELY ENGAGED IN OUR US                            MARKETS IF DONE SKILLFULLY THIS FORCES THEM TO MEET THE REQUIREMENTS                            OF THE SOPHISTICATED US MARKET MFN ENTRY                            INTO US MARKETS CAN HAVE AN IMPACT ON                            SOVIET BEHAVIOR THIS IS NOT A TRIVIAL MATTER15 IT IS IN OUR LONGTERM INTERESTS TO USE THESE STRENGTHS TO BREAK DOWN                            THE AUTARKIC NATURE OF THE USSR THERE                            ARE CONSUMER CHOICES BEING MADE IN THE USSR THAT ALTHOUGH MORE BELOW THE SURFACE THAN THOSE IN                            THE UNITED STATES CAN BE EXPLOITED THIS IS JUST ONE ILLUSTRATION                            THERE ARE MANY ASSETS IN THE WEST IN THIS AREA AND INSTEAD OF LOOKING AT                            THEM AS JUST COMMERCIAL SALES WE NEED TO BE USING THEM TO DRAW THE                            SOVIET UNION INTO A SERIES OF DEPENDENCIES AND TIES WITH THE WEST IT IS                            A LONGTERM PROJECT16 WHEN WE LOST THE MFN BATTLE WITH                            CONGRESS WE LOST OUR ABILITY TO IMPOSE A DEGREE OF DISCIPLINE ON THE                            SOVIET UNION AS WE WERE ABLE TO DO IN THE CASE OF THE GRAIN DEAL THIS                            IS THE REAL TRAGEDY OF LOSING THAT TRADE ISSUE IN THE LONGTERM WE                            HAVE SUFFERED A SETBACK17 WITH REGARD TO EASTERN EUROPE IT MUST BE IN OUR LONGTERM INTEREST                            TO INFLUENCE EVENTS IN THIS AREA  BECAUSE OF THE PRESENT UNNATURAL                            RELATIONSHIP WITH THE SOVIET UNION  SO THAT THEY WILL NOT SOONER OR                            LATER EXPLODE CAUSING WW III THIS INORGANIC UNNATURAL RELATIONSHIP IS                            A FAR GREATER DANGER TO WORLD PEACE THAN THE CONFLICT BETWEEN EAST AND                            WEST THERE IS ONE QUALIFICATION TO THIS STATEMENT IF WESTERN EUROPE                            BECOMES SO CONCERNED WITH ITS ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL PROBLEMS THAT AN                            IMBALANCE DEVELOPS THEN PERHAPS THE DANGERS TO THE UNITED STATES                            INTERESTS WILL BE ENDANGERED BY THE SIMPLE CHANGE IN THE BALANCE OF                            POWER18 SO IT MUST BE OUR POLICY TO STRIVE FOR AN EVOLUTIONSECRETPAGE 06 STATE 024976THAT MAKES THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE EASTERN EUROPEANS AND THE SOVIET                            UNION AN ORGANIC ONE ANY EXCESS OF ZEAL ON OUR PART IS BOUND TO PRODUCE                            RESULTS THAT COULD REVERSE THE DESIRED PROCESS FOR A PERIOD OF TIME                            EVEN THOUGH THE PROCESS WOULD REMAIN INEVITABLE WITHIN THE NEXT 100                            YEARS BUT OF COURSE FOR US THAT IS TOO                            LONG A TIME TO WAIT19 SO OUR POLICY MUST BE A POLICY OF RESPONDING TO THE CLEARLY VISIBLE                            ASPIRATIONS IN EASTERN EUROPE FOR A MORE AUTONOMOUS EXISTENCE WITHIN THE                            CONTEXT OF A STRONG SOVIET GEOPOLITICAL INFLUENCE THIS HAS WORKED IN                            POLAND THE POLES HAVE BEEN ABLE TO OVERCOME THEIR ROMANTIC POLITICAL                            INCLINATIONS WHICH LED TO THEIR DISASTERS IN THE PAST THEY HAVE BEEN                            SKILLFUL IN DEVELOPING A POLICY THAT IS SATISFYING THEIR NEEDS FOR A                            NATIONAL IDENTITY WITHOUT AROUSING SOVIET REACTIONS IT IS A LONG                            PROCESS20 A SIMILAR PROCESS IS NOW GOING ON IN HUNGARY JANOS KADARS PERFORMANCE HAS BEEN                            REMARKABLE IN FINDING WAYS WHICH ARE ACCEPTABLE TO THE SOVIET UNION                            WHICH DEVELOP HUNGARIAN ROOTS AND THE NATURAL ASPIRATIONS OF THE PEOPLE                            HE HAS CONDUCTED A NUMBER OF EXPERIMENTS IN THE SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC                            AREAS TO A LARGE DEGREE HE HAS BEEN ABLE TO DO THIS BECAUSE THE SOVIETS                            HAVE FOUR DIVISIONS IN HUNGARY AND THEREFORE HAVE NOT BEEN OVERLY                            CONCERNED HE HAS SKILLFULLY USED THEIR PRESENCE AS A SECURITY BLANKET                            FOR THE SOVIETS IN A WAY THAT HAS BEEN ADVANTAGEOUS TO THE DEVELOPMENT                            OF HIS OWN COUNTRY21 THE ROMANIAN PICTURE IS DIFFERENT AS ONE WOULD EXPECT FROM THEIR                            DIFFERENT HISTORY THE ROMANIANS HAVE STRIVEN FOR AUTONOMY BUT THEY HAVE                            BEEN LESS DARING AND INNOVATIVE IN THEIR DOMESTIC SYSTEMS THEY REMAIN                            AMONG THE MOST RIGID COUNTRIES IN THE INTERNAL ORGANIZATION OF THEIR                            SYSTEM22 WE SEEK TO INFLUENCE THE EMERGENCE OF THE SOVIET IMPERIAL POWER BY                            MAKING THE BASE MORE NATURAL AND ORGANIC SO THAT IT WILL NOT REMAIN                            FOUNDED IN SHEER POWER ALONE BUT THERE IS NO ALTERNATIVE OPEN TO US OTHER THAN THAT OF INFLUENCING THE WAY                            SOVIET POWER IS USEDSECRETPAGE 07 STATE 02497623 FINALLY ON YUGOSLAVIA WE AND THE WESTERN EUROPEANS INDEED THE                            EASTERN EUROPEANS AS WELL HAVE AN INTEREST WHICH BORDERS ON THE VITAL                            FOR US IN CONTINUING THE INDEPENDENCE OF                            YUGOSLAVIA FROM SOVIET DOMINATION OF COURSE WE ACCEPT THAT YUGOSLAV                            BEHAVIOR WILL CONTINUE TO BE AS IT HAS BEEN IN THE PAST INFLUENCED AND                            CONSTRAINED BY SOVIET POWER BUT ANY SHIFT BACK BY YUGOSLAVIA INTO THE                            SOVIET ORBIT WOULD REPRESENT A MAJOR STRATEGIC SETBACK FOR THE WEST SO                            WE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT WHAT WILL HAPPEN WHEN TITO DISAPPEARS AND IT IS                            WORRYING US A GOOD DEAL24 SO OUR BASIC POLICY CONTINUES TO BE THAT WHICH WE HAVE PURSUED SINCE                            194849 KEEPING YUGOSLAVIA IN A POSITION OF SUBSTANTIAL INDEPENDENCE                            FROM THE SOVIET UNION NOW AT THE SAME TIME WE WOULD LIKE THEM TO BE                            LESS OBNOXIOUS AND WE SHOULD ALLOW THEM TO GET AWAY WITH VERY LITTLE                            WE SHOULD ESPECIALLY DISABUSE THEM OF ANY NOTION THAT OUR INTEREST IN                            THEIR RELATIVE INDEPENDENCE IS GREATER THAN THEIR OWN AND THEREFORE                            THEY HAVE A FREE
