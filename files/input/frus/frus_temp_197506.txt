believe it is timely to review P3                        operations from Bandar Abbas to assure continuing utility for USG and compliance with Country Team rules and                            GOI

                   to SecDef with recommendation that                            we a phase out regular flts but keep periodic                            flts b start flts to Masirah c consider

permission for P3 flights to stage out of                        Bandar Abbas in support of US Indian Ocean operations Subsequently Ref A GOI approved prolongation of flights with two                        conditions:A Cover story should be maintained that P3s were present in Bandar Abbas to                        train Iranians on aircraft they would later acquireB Bandar Abbas should not take shape as US base in Iran2 Since that time we have made no formal approach to GOI on this subject Flights are currently                        continuing on average of 56 in and out missions per week There are                        regularly one officer and three enlisted personnel at Bandar Abbas to                        support flights Although these personnel are on 46 weeks TDY USN presence has been a continuous one                        Although the Ambassador concurred in P3 operations at time of approach to                            GOI no request has ever been made to                        him for assignment of USN personnel at                        Bandar Abbas3 It is evident that GOI stipulations for                        use of Bandar Abbas have been overtaken by changed circumstances Cover                        story is no longer appropriate as IIAF now                        has three of its own P3s at Bandar Abbas Long tenure of operation is                        giving it a permanent character that was not original GOI intent For example study on US                        involvement in Iran by OASDPAERepro of 22 January 1975 contains this                        statement in its listing of US facilities in Iran: P3 aircraft operate from                        Bandar Abbas with an average frequency of two flights per week or an                        occasional maximum of three flights daily when a target Naval Task Group                        operates in the area One officer and two enlisted men are stationed at                        Bandar Abbas to support operations They increase during peak periods to ten                        men    During a briefing for the War College a student asked us to                        comment on our Indian Ocean operation at Bandar Abbas It seems that P3                        flights are becoming common knowledge and assumed by many in DOD to be routine business With Congressional                        interest focusing on Diego Garcia and Persian Gulf arms sales it is                        plausible that State and DOD will face                        questions on P3 operations Our answers could prove embarrassing to GOI at time when it is asserting a strongly                        independent line on Persian Gulf security Ref B4 Accordingly we think that as a matter of some priority USG should review P3 operation Essentially                        two questions should be addressed: First is intelligence product from these                        flights of sufficient importance to USG to                        justify political problems that may result from public exposure Second if                        answer is positive could our intelligence objectives be achieved without                        presence of USN personnel at Bandar Abbas                        and with less frequent more sporadic flights Occasional P3 visits would                        preserve an air of normalcy which would be useful if for high priority                        targets or crisis situation we wished to expand frequency of missions on                        short notice5 Should review indicate that continuing assignment of USN personnel at Bandar Abbas is desirable an                        anticipated duration of stay should                        be submitted to Ambassador for his approval Request should also outline                        suggested command lines to include responsibility to Ambassador through                        Chief ARMISHMAAG as the senior                            DOD representative in Iran6 Our final step would be approach to GOI                        if that seems appropriate in terms of findings of review of P3 operations                        and probability of public exposure If operations are to be maintained at                        present levels we should consult with GOI                        on public line we would take if asked by Congress or pressOn July 8 Ellsworth sent a memorandum on Schlesingers behalf to the Director                            of the Joint Staff requesting that P3 operations from Bandar Abbas be                            reviewed with a view to reducing the number of flights to ensure that                            the base does not take on the character of a permanent US operating                            facility Ibid OASD Files: FRC 330780038 Box 18 Iran 33440013                            1975 In a memorandum to Schlesinger August 8 Ellsworth reported that the JCS and Navy had determined that support personnel at                            Bandar Abbas could be eliminated and P3 flights reduced from 1618 to                            68 a month except when major US naval units were in the area                            IbidHelms	19750602

112142 to Tehran May 20 provided the prcis                            of NIE 34175 Ibid D7501700902                            The NIE is Document                                1211 Unfortunately as often happens with summaries of lengthy documents                        prcis of NIE on Iran reftel is in our view misleading in its                            starkness and gives rather                        alarmist portrayal of Iranian political situation Full text of NIE has now been received and we find it more                        balanced presentation than suggested by prcis While we agree with most of                        its basic conclusions some points are overstated and document is                        occasionally inconsistent Comments on specific topics follow2 Opposition: Statement that opposition is increasingly repressed prcis                        Section A contrasts with NIEs conclusion                        that many Iranians ie administrators middle class professionals and bulk                        of urban middle class are essentially passive in their view of regime and                        satisfied to maximize their economic benefits while playing the game para                        15 Shah still plays central role and brooks no direct opposition to his                        policies but Embassy made point in its A71 of April 11 1975The airgram is entitled The Recent Evolution of Power                            in Iran National Archives RG 59                            Central Foreign Policy Files P7500652420 that Shah and his                        immediate entourage do not control all daytoday decisions in todays Iran                        so long as those decisions are made within policy guidelines Shah has                        established NIEs conclusion that                        oppositionists desires to share political power today are more troublesome                        than during Mossadegh era para 17 is incorrect if it refers to organized                        political activity and dissent because control from the top has become more                        effective Students for example do not pose danger to regime today which                        they did in 196163 period Neither do vast bulk of professional and middle                        class who are busy making a good living Peasants and farmers are not and                        have not been a factor3 On other hand NIE is correct in noting                        increase in acts of terrorism para 18 Opposition is negative and wants to                        destroy existing power structureit is devoid of alternative strategies for                        political and economic development Beginning in 1962 the Shah adopted                        nationalist proposals for reform added his own programs and forged them                        into the twelve point ShahPeople Revolution A31 of February 24

thus far failed to foster effective political participation One of his                        reasons for creation of the Resurgence Party was to stimulate broader                        participation on grounds that former multiparty system resulted in waste of                        effort without achieving this participation but it remains to be seen how                        effective Resurgence Party will be in bringing forth creative energies of                        its vast membership We agree with statement in Air Force representatives                        footnote to para 20 that problems in modernization program should not all be                        interpreted as danger signs for regime Estimate overstates the significance and extent of dissent in                        Iran and prejudges Shahs capacity to effect successful reforms4 Limitations on Bureaucratic and Government Effectiveness: Administrative                        ineffectiveness and corruption of many government ministries is still fact                        of life in Tehran However there have evolved such effective economic                        institutions as Central Bank NIOC                        National Iranian PetroChemical Company Plan and Budget Organization and                        Ministry of Economic Affairs and Finance Provided military remains unified                        behind leader who takes reins after Shah leaves scene these organizations                        and multiple middle class vested interests could provide stability for                        future and would have political as well as economic benefits5 Constraints on Economic Development: NIE                        is correct in citing limitations on economic growth but we do not see any                        shortages today which could cause significant economic and political                        problems para 29 In short run shortages of skilled labor can be filled                        by importing people but eventually Iran must train its own technicians                        Port and transportation bottlenecks can be partially alleviated by projects                        such as jetty construction by South Koreans now underway in Khorramshahr                        However leveling off or decline of oil revenues would inhibit capacity of                            GOI to solve above development problems                        by large infusions of money6 Nuclear Weapons: Prcis is too dramatic in predicting Shah will attempt to                        acquire nuclear weapon technology This distorts main thrust of his policy                        which is to acquire nationwide nuclear energy network Obvious byproduct                        would be potential to develop nuclear weapons capability and it could be one                        he would opt for if area nuclear arms race got underway It would of                        course depend on whether needed foreign technical assistance would be                        available7 Persian Gulf: Embassy does not see Shah needing to risk confrontation with                        Arabs West or Soviet Union to continue to play major role in Gulf para                        51 In recent years he has achieved much in cooperating with Arab states in                            OPEC and improving bilateral relations                        with Gulf states including negotiation of median line agreements in the                        Gulf Concept of nonaggression pact and security agreement in Gulf is                        receiving increasing support from littoral states with Iran and Iraq                        actively taking soundings in other Gulf states Issue of unilateral                        deployment of forces to forestall establishment of radical regime in Gulf                        area is probably unlikely Shah is aware of damage this would do to his                        cooperative image in Gulf area as well as practical limits to such a venture                        if opposed by other area states He would of course be prepared to                        consider rendering assistance if requested as in case of Dhofar rebellion                        Although Shah has stated Irans ultimate objective as expulsion of foreign                        power influence from Persian Gulf and Indian Ocean these steps could take place only after littoral states                        had built up their own power and provided for their own security Although                        Shah has said he wants to see US forces leave Bahrain he has linked this to                        Soviet pullout from Umm Qasr in Iraq which he knows is unlikely In view                        his need for American technical assistance in building up blue water navy                        and his realization that it will be years before Iranian and other littoral                        navies could begin to balance Soviet presence we doubt Shah would press for                        US withdrawal from Bahrain any time soon8 Oil for Israel: Prcis comment that Iran is becoming less likely to                        supply Israel with oil in event of resumed hostilities contrasts with more                        cautious conclusions in body of report that we cannot be confident Iran                        would continue such supply Although recent public statements by Shah and                        others have taken on a more proArab and antiIsrael flavor Iran still                        finds 1 lines not declassified9 Divergence of Interest: Prcis notes increasing number of areas where                        Shahs interests diverge from ours Reading the report we note only three:                        oil prices Persian Gulf and Congressional limitations on atomic energy                        assistance On other hand there are many areas in which our interests                        continue to coincide and in which cooperation is likely to remain                        effective10 Future Attitudes Toward US: We believe paragraph J of prcis may be too                        optimistic If more extreme regime replaced that of Shah Embassy believes                        US could not take it for granted that cooperative relationship would                        continue Increased xenophobia caused by large influx of foreign                        technicians particularly US and traditional Iranian fear of being                        dominated by foreigners who make themselves essential to GOI might cause reaction against that close                        relationship Result could be cancelling of some arms deals further                        diversification of purchases limits on numbers of Americans working here                        and curtailment of some intelligencegathering facilitiesHelms	19750619

          5460In telegram 5460 from Tehran June 11                            the Embassy noted the increasing speculation that Iran Saudi Arabia                            and Iraq were preparing to sign a collective security pact for the Gulf                            region Ibid D75020303291 I called on MFA Under Secretary Jafar                        Nadim who had accompanied Foreign Minister Khalatbary to Baghdad this past                        week to ask him how he thought the visit wentAccording to telegram 642 from Baghdad June 15 an IraqiIranian                            treaty and three protocols were concluded in Baghdad on June 13 during                                Khalatbaris visit The                            treaty was signed by Foreign Ministers Hammadi Khalatbari and Bouteflika Ibid D7502080575                        In opening the conversation I noted Tehran press reports that all                        outstanding issues between Iran and Iraq had now been settled He quickly                        replied that this was not the case He said that with settlement of water                        and land border definitions and questions relating to the Kurds behind them                        the two countries were now working on another package deal which would                        address four additional questions: A navigation on the ShattalArab B                        water rights and usage of rivers that flow between one country and the                        other C the mandate and operation of a joint border commission and D                        pasturage usage for tribes that move from one side of the border to another                        during different grazing seasons It was agreed that both sides would try to                        have details of this package deal worked out and ready for signature within                        three months2 I asked Nadim about the pilgrimage issue He said that this was to be                        dealt with outside of the aforementioned package deal There was some                        difficult logistic and by implication security issues that had to be                        worked out and this was to be handled by a separate commission that both                        countries had agreed in principle to establish As an example of the kinds                        of problems this commission would address Nadim said if the pilgrimage                        gates were open two million Iranians would immediately apply for passports                        to visit holy places in Iraq He said there was no way Iranian passport and                        police authorities could cope with this volume immediately Further he noted                        that the two main holy places in Iraq Najaf and Kerbala are small towns                        that could not handle 10000 pilgrims at best He thought that it would be                        some time before agreement could be                        reached on these kinds of questions and that they would certainly not be                        resolved by this August A date we had heard earlier was established for                        the beginning of pilgrimage travel3 Noting that there had been a good deal of speculation in the press about a                        Persian Gulf security pact I asked Nadim whether the matter was discussed                        last week in Baghdad He said that he had talked with the Iraqi Deputy                        Foreign Minister about it and that Khalatbary had discussed the matter with                            Hammadi in a tetetete but he                        did not know the details of the latter conversation In general however he                        said that it was agreed both sides would keep each other informed of their                        soundings with other Persian Gulf states It was Irans position that any                        such agreement had to involve all of the Persian Gulf states and that none                        should be given the impression that the terms of such an agreement were                        being dictated by one party or another In this connection he said that very                        careful preparations would have to be made before any conference of Persian                        Gulf states could be held on the subject and that he thought therefore such                        a meeting would be unlikely to occur in the near future4 I asked him how the atmospherics were in Baghdad He replied with a grin                        friendly but I would be lying if I said they were very friendly He added                        that the Iraqis still harbor deep suspicions about Iranian motives and                        objectives He did not say so but we believe the same can be said of the                        IraniansMiklos	19750616

wanted to move ahead on a                                Cyprus settlement He thought that positions could be clarified                                during the intercommunal talks National Archives

summary2 I called on Makarios morning                            June 10 to deliver your oral message He listened attentively and said                            to thank you3 Without introduction Makarios                            then launched into a diatribe against Vienna II and Clerides Vienna he said had been a                            fraud and a failure covered over with nice words GOC position had suffered as a result He                            could not fault Waldheim for                            trying to convey an appearance of optimism and progress but he himself                            was completely pessimistic He could and would take Clerides to task for having made several                            serious mistakes4 Enumerating Clerides errors                                Makarios said that first                            he had without guidance stated before departure that he would leave                            Vienna if Turkish Cypriots proceeded with June 8 constitutional                            referendum In Vienna Clerides                            had been obliged to climb down from this Second in final                                communiquTransmitted in telegram 3800                                from Vienna May 3 Ibid he had accepted language                            referring to possibility of a transitional federal government He had                            done so without instructions and transitional government was                            unacceptable to GOC Third in press                            questions and answers following announcement of communiqu Clerides had alluded to a Turkish                            proposal on refugee return when no such proposal existed5 Makarios said Clerides would be briefing Council of                            Ministers and National Council about Vienna on June 11 and intimated                            that he would be chastised both in that session and publicly6 I replied that just before our meeting I had been ruminating about the                            prodigious amount of diplomatic energy it has taken to get a Cyprus                            negotiation going and keep it alive I cited the recent principal and                            visible manifestations of the effort: visits to Ankara by Secretary                                Kissinger and Assistant                            Secretary Hartman visits to                            Athens by latter Hartman met with Caglayangil                                on April 21

                         pointed out that the objective of these several efforts was to create                            the framework and atmosphere in which a Cyprus solution fair to Greek                            Cypriots could be reached We were well aware of Archbishops interest                            in internationalizing the Cyprus problem We believe this was his                            decision to make but frankly we would not see it paying off While we                            understand that Turkish unreadiness to talk about specifics in Vienna                            was a disappointment to GOC we felt                            strongly that continued negotiation along present line was the only path                            with any promise Others obviously felt the same Actions of Waldheim and Clerides in Vienna should I believed be read in this                            positive light With admittedly very little to go on prospects for a                            continued negotiation had been salvaged7 Makarios backed off somewhat                            He said he recognized and appreciated the great efforts of President                                Ford and Secretary Kissinger to keep negotiation and hope                            for progress alive even though these efforts were late Similarly                            although nothing positive had resulted for Cyprus itself KaramanlisDEMIREL meeting had undoubtedly been beneficial in terms                            of easing tension between Greece and Turkey That easing of tension in                            turn might eventually help a Cyprus solution Nevertheless Vienna II                            had illserved GOC interests In addition to the annoying reference to a                            transitional government which was a clear effort to erode the GOCs international position language of                            communiqu put Greek and Turkish sides on an equal plane In fact                                Clerides had gone with                            positive attitude and flexible instructions that empowered him to                            discuss all aspects whereas Turkey had reneged on Denktash commitment of Vienna I and come                            up with nothing As a result of communiqu language GOCs international position had suffered                            The basis for any useful debate in coming SC meeting on Cyprus had been                            destroyed Waldheims report would                            be anodyne and a resolution on the negotiation if any would be                            inconsequential In reply to my interjected question Makarios said it would now be                            pointless to send special representation to New York for the debate                                GOC position would be handled by                                Rossides8 Makarios said that despite his                            criticisms of Vienna Waldheim and                                Clerides he fully supported                            continued negotiation He was not seeking internationalization as a                            substitute He had little to gain from an international conference                            Rather he was afraid that lulled by a series of communiqus along the                            lines of Vienna I and Vienna II the world would forget about the                            unsolved Cyprus problem and condone continued faits accomplis by the                            Turks such as their referendum elections possible unilateral                            declaration of independence and their adamant refusal to discuss the                            real issues Therefore he considered it essential to use meetings of                            the UNSC and UNGA and his own travels to keep the Cyprus problem                            before the world9 I replied that I could understand Archbishops desire to keep                            international attention alive if that was as it was I cautioned                            however that this variety of internationalization if pushed too far in                            certain directions would cut across the other negotiating track10 I asked the Archbishop whether he viewed his recent visits to Gulf                            states and forthcoming visits to other Arab states in terms of                            maintaining international interest and further whether his efforts to                            win greater Arab support had implications for GOC relations with Israel Was he for example considering                            any downgrading in GOC diplomatic                            relations with Israel as a gesture to the Arabs Makarios replied that he valued GOCs good relations with Israel and                            intended no change whatsoever In visits to the Arab states while                            showing sympathy for Arab concerns he had been and would continue to be                            careful to hew a delicate line between sympathy and underwriting all                            their positions In general he had found the safest way was to refer to                                UN resolutions He repeated that he                            was not prepared to consider any change in the nature of his                            relationship with Israel I suggested that this being the case he have                            FonMin Christophides say                            something reassuring to the Israelis before he left on his next swing                            through the Arab world Makarios                            said he would do so He indicated that his present plan is to leave June                            16 for Cairo then go to Damascus and Beirut if situation there was                            stabilized by then and thereafter to Baghdad Libya and possibly                            Algeria although Algerian arrangements not yet firm11 On another aspect I asked Makarios whether his frequent use of the term long                            struggle implied a military component as well as the economic                            revivification he had previously mentioned to me and which I noted he                            now had under discussion with GOC I                            referred in the former sense to creation of various new selfstyled                            resistance fronts and GOC promulgation                            of a law on compulsory reserve training for all Greek males up to age                            60 Makarios replied blandly                            that he was a man of peace and did not believe in force to solve                            problems He did not approve creation of resistance fronts although he                            acknowledged at least one group was comprised of his own                            supporters12 Concluding I recalled question Makarios had put to me in Washington concerning use of a                            portion of potential FY76 25 million in                            supporting assistance for construction of houses for refugees now in                            tents I said that despite what Archbishop had been told by Congressmen                            this money might be some distance from appropriation If it was voted                                USG would want to continue to donate                            a substantial portion to UNHCR for its valuable relief work                            Nevertheless question of supporting GOC                            in some way on refugee housing was discussable and in fact pursuant to                            Archbishops interest was already under review by Embassy with                            appropriate GOC officials One thought                            was to relieve GOC of some of the burden                            of its subsidies to refugees through their activity in this field thus                            freeing GOC funds for housing On  basis of personal experience                            with Palestine refugee problem I expressed concern that US funds not be                            used to create permanent camps which would become a breeding ground for                            an immutable refugee mentality and fanatacism which was not in GOC interest Makarios agreed and said his purpose was to construct                            housing to integrate refugees into existing urban communities13 Comment: Makarios anger with Clerides as evidenced in this conversation is supported                            by a wellsourced less than 1 line not                                declassified report being transmitted simultaneouslyNot found Latter states that                                Makarios is actually                            thinking of ways in which he can unload Clerides in favor of a more compliant Greek Cypriot                            negotiatorCrawford	19750610

             Ankara as desired Subject: Conversation with Clerides Ref: Nicosia 1882Document 1811 Summary Clerides has asked that                            I convey his current thinking to you on a confidential basis pursuant                            your suggestion He believes Makarios is trying to weaken his position out of                            suspicion that there may be an evolving axis between him and Karamanlis and a desire to see present                            negotiation fail quickly Clerides                            reiterated criticism of proMakarios role of Greek Ambassador here He stressed                            urgent need for centrist political movement led by him to counter                            increasingly successful Communist activity encouraged by Makarios End summary2 I saw Clerides June 27our first                            meeting since Vienna II and UNSC Cyprus                            debate3 At the outset I told Clerides                            that Makarios had sharply                            criticized him in conversation with me just after Vienna II reftel I                            asked if there were an explanation for this display of calculated anger                            other than reasons given by Archbishop ie Clerides acceptance of an appearance of progress and                            reference to transitional government in final communiqu Karamanlis had given strong support                                Clerides in Vienna Was                                Makarios perhaps worried                            that Karamanlis and Clerides had developed a mutuality of                            interest and understanding from which he being excluded Was Makarios seeking to demean him in eyes                            of Greek Cypriots in order to break up this axis I noted the private                            conversations which had taken place between Karamanlis and Clerides and asked about the state of their                            relationship4 Clerides prefaced his reply by                            recalling that in your last conversation with him you had said he could                            communicate with you confidentially through me He asked that his                            following remarks be treated in this sense5 Clerides said he believed                                Makarios was actively                            seeking to undermine his position because A he had wanted Vienna II to                            fail and B he was suspicious of the very good relationship which had                            evolved with Karamanlis Re A                                Makarios wished to be free                            to pursue his preferred path of building Arab nonaligned and Soviet                            support looking toward UNGA and its                            advocacy of a broader international negotiation As evidence of this                                Clerides said he had informed                                Makarios that substantive                            progress might well not be possible by July 24 date for reconvening                            Vienna discussion and that a postponement might therefore be desirable                                Makarios had replied that                            regardless they wanted the next round to take place as scheduled                                Makarios Clerides thought wanted to precipitate                            a failure of this negotiation as quickly as possible lest Turks come up                            with something quasireasonable Unfortunately Turkey playing directly                            into his hands by its unwillingnessinability to table positions on                            territory and refugees Given the situation in Ankara and Makarios attitude the prospects for                            sustained negotiation were poor Clerides said he was relying on your assurance that you                            would do what you could with Turkey but he appreciated the difficulties                            in this6 Returning to my question of his relationship with Karamanlis Clerides said everything was fine when the two could                            meet face to face When he was in Nicosia however all communications                            had to run through Dountas who put                            everything through the optic of his total personal commitment to                                Makarios I asked if this                            had come up in Clerides private                            conversations with Karamanlis and                                Clerides nodded He thought                                Karamanlis had come to realize                            how much of a problem he had on this score Karamanlis had looked creased after their discussion                                Comment: Undoubtedly because Dountas is a strong partisan of                                Mavros he would be difficult                            to transfer without stimulating politically  motivated criticism from latter End                                comment Clerides                            cautioned me against confiding in Dountas I said that from long experience with him I had                            learned the wisdom of being quite uncommunicative7 Clerides then broached what he                            said was the main concern he wished to convey at this time: the                            interrelationship of developments on the Greek Cypriot political scene                            and the negotiation under Waldheim8 Clerides remarked that as I                            undoubtedly aware Makarios was                            discreetly encouraging activity by AKEL                            the official Cyprus Communist Party and Lyssarides unofficial Communist as part of his effort                            to attract nonaligned and leftist support internationally Building on                            economic dislocation and political frustration both were making                            dangerous headway The situation urgently required the creation of a                            broad political movement aimed at pulling together political factions                            from the genuinely progressive leftofcenter to the right but excluding                            on the far right those tainted by active association with last summers                            coup This movement would not be opposed to Makarios and would indeed draw in many of his supporters                            who currently discomfited by his reliance on the left A counterweight                            to the latter was increasingly essential and Clerides said he knew only he could lead it Problem for                            him was that he felt himself intellectually and morally committed to                            continuing the present Cyprus negotiation If having brought a center                            movement into being the negotiation failed and discredited him it would                            also seriously and perhaps irrevocably damage the chances of a                            successful center coalition Clerides said he had to weigh this against the danger of                            letting nonCommunist forces remain leaderless His decision was to                            defer for at least another two or three months the announcement of a                            center movement to allow some more time for progress in the negotiation                            In the interim time would not be completely wasted as lists of movement                            leaders structure and program could be developed To counter AKEL which subsidized by Russia and                                Lyssarides who generously                            supported by Syria and Libya and successful opposition movement would                            have to have resources which would be hard to come by given straitened                            economic circumstances of politically sympathetic potential backers9 My conversation with Clerides                            was three times interrupted from calls from UNSYG Special Representative                            Weckmann to the effect that Denktash has gone back on agreement reached June 25 to                            swap some Turkish students in the south for permission for ten Greek                            Cypriot teachers to be allowed to go to Greek enclaves in Karpass Dated June 26 National Archives RG 59 Central Foreign Policy Files                                1975Denktash Weckmann told Clerides wanted his Turks but was                            temporarily unable make arrangements for the Greek teachers Clerides said then there could be                            no deal and by telephone ordered transfer of Turkish students halted                            commenting to me that matters were back to square one Clerides also noted with dismay                                Denktashs admission to                            foreign journalists that Greek personal property and merchandise in                            Famagusta being removed and transferred to Nicosia for sale and other                            disposition Greeks he said read this as indicating Turkish intention                            to repopulate New Famagusta in the near future10 Comment: Unless you wish I do not think a                            reply from you to Clerides is                            required by the nature of his comment End                                commentCrawford	19750627
frus1969-76v31d91	91 Telegram From the Embassy in France to the Department of State	None	1975-06-25 11:47:00	None	None	16454 Subject: President Giscard                                dEstaing May Make New Specific Proposals to the US                            about Worsening Economic Situation1 During diplomatic corps reception at the Elyse Palace the evening of                            June 24 President Giscard                                dEstaing took me aside for a private conversation He is                            very concerned about deteriorating economic conditions in France and                            Europe and feels that joint action with the United States is required                            to turn the situation around He said he might be in touch with                            President Ford to initiate                            discussions based on specific proposals although he might decide to use                            other channels2 Giscard said there are a number                            of aspects of the economic situation which worry him and he focused on                            two of them during our conversationinternational monetary relations and                            unemployment3 On monetary problems Giscard                            said the dollar is too undervalued for the economic health of Europe                            The lack of US Government support for the dollar is disconcerting                                Giscard said and our                            insistence on maintaining floating rates is also hurting Looking back                            at recent monetary talks Giscard                            said both the French and Americans could have shown more flexibility                            and he expected to be in touch with us soon with some specific new                            proposals and with the hope that more flexibility would be shown by both                            sides I assured Giscard that we                            maintained a flexible attitude toward discussions of this issue I                            reminded him that the United States originally opposed the institution                            of floating rates in 1971 but naturally we had no choice but to go                            along when the Germans and Dutch took the initiative On the whole                            floating rates have not worked too badly The dollar has held up pretty                            well except in relation to certain European currencies the massive                            currency speculation that we witnessed prior to floating rates has                            diminished considerably and the Europeans have had less need to                            intervene in currency markets to protect the dollar I assured him                            however that we were prepared to look carefully at any new proposal                            that he might launch4 On unemployment Giscard said                            the French and German economies are continuing their downward trends It                            had been expected that recovery would have been evident by this time He                            wanted to know the latest news about the situation in the United                            States5 I said that according to the latest estimates of the Presidents                            Council of Economic Advisers the US economy had reached its lowest                            point and is starting to recover The big questions are whether recovery                            will be at an acceptable or inflationary rate and how much strength the                            recovery will have Indications now are that both will be acceptable I                            told him that on the basis of my experience in private industry I could                            predict that employment would recover much more slowly than the overall                            economy This is due to the reductions in excess labor previously                            employed as a hedge against shortage increased rationalization of                            labor and increased mechanization which is a continuing process in                            highly competitive industry6 Giscard said he wished he could                            see a reversal of increasing unemployment in Europe but there is                            nothing similar to the US situation on the horizon I said that                            traditionally Europe tends to lag several months behind the United                            States so the beginning of recovery in the United States today could                            mean a similar development in Europe some months later Giscard said he hoped so but felt that                            joint action between Europe and the United States would be advisable to                            push the process along He said he or his associates would be in touch                            with us to initiate discussions on specific proposals7 Comment: Unemployment is a sensitive issue in                            all countries In France it could be a source of serious political                            instability Giscard is now

frus1969-76v37d66	66 Telegram From the Department of State to the Embassy in France	None	1975-06-14 21:52:00	None	None	139949 Subject: Message for Sauvagnargues1 Please transmit the following message to Foreign Minister Sauvagnargues at earliest convenience:Dear Jean:A representative from your Embassy here was in touch with us last MondayJune 9 concerning your concept of moving                        directly to an enlarged Ministerial meeting of 27 countries as a means of                        relaunching the dialogue on energy commodities and other development                        issues Since then I have had a report of the conversation between Messrs                            FromentMeuriceHenri                                FromentMeurice Chief of the Asian Division of the                            French Foreign Ministry and RobinsonI have given your concept considerable thought In order to enable us to                        proceed in close cooperation I thought it might be helpful if I put our own                        thoughts before youI recognize your desire to build on the discussions at Kleber in AprilThe Klber Conference Center in Paris where the                            April 715 Prepcon took                            place but wonder if there was really sufficient agreement to do                        so There was only a tentative understanding on a 26 or 27 member group and                        on its division between energy producing countries developing countries                        and industrial countries The whole was at that time conditioned on                        agreement on an agenda and on such contentious issues as the status of the                        International Energy Agency observers To attempt now through bilateral                        contacts to establish a basis for agreement on who the 27 would be on the                        representation of the Agency and on what the 27 would do strikes me as an                        impossibly difficult taskBut even if it could succeed I believe there would be a real question as to                        its utility An enlarged conference of this type would be tempted to get                        into the substance of issues and to try to set up some way of leveraging                        issues one against the other A large conference would be tempted to                        perpetuate itself subordinating the commissions to its governance We could                        thus have all too easily a miniUN and the                        ingredients for a new failureIt seems to me far more prudent to build on Kleber by reconvening the                        preparatory conference in the same format After all the 10 participants                        agreed that they were not ending their effort but only suspending it                        Although not free of controversy this forum has the merit of existing                        participants in it could very probably agree to reconvene it with a minimum                        of negotiationI recognize the point that has been made to us by many of the producing                        countries that legitimacy of commissions created by only 10 countries might                        be contested notably by developing countries that did not participate in                        Kleber To overcome that point which I believe valid the correct solution                        would appear to be that proposed by Yamani: To use the preparatory meeting to agree on the whole                        process the membership of the commissions their terms of reference their                        status visvis each other and then to convene a 1 or 2 day meeting of                        Foreign Ministers to launch themA further point that has been raised by some that there should be an                        arrangement for the commissions to report back seems to me to have much                        less force Countries that are concerned that the work of the commissions                        should proceed more or less at the same pace can satisfy themselves that                        this is so by arrangements for the commission chairmen to report to each                        other the progress of their work But to report back to the enlarged                        Ministerial meeting would suppose that the Ministerial meeting would have to                        be held again and that it will have to deal with substantive issues I do                        not think we should commit ourselves now to such a substantive membership                        meeting at Ministerial levelPlease let me know your thoughts on this issueThe French Embassy delivered Sauvagnarguess reply to Kissinger on June 23 The Foreign Minister wrote that                            France had no preconceived idea regarding procedure and was prepared                            to support what will be likely to receive general approval in conditions                            suited not only to ensure the resumption but above all to guarantee the                            pursuit and continuation of the dialogue However he added he was                            thoroughly convinced of the need for an approach that is both global                                and differentiated On the subject of                            establishing three committees of actually unequal status whose results                            could no longer be compared he did not think the formula would                            receive the approval of the developing countries which will inevitably                            interpret it in terms of priority for energy Furthermore in terms of                            the conferences composition he argued that Kissingers reasoning against the 27                            formula is equally applicable to the 10 formula Telegram 151916 to                            Cairo June 27 National Archives RG                            59 Central Foreign Policy Files P8500362564 as I think that

INCREASE IN                            AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION WHICH I DO INDEED BELIEVE WILL RESULT IN                            CONSIDERABLE PROGRESS HERE THIS YEAR AND MORE MARKEDLY SO IN NEXT                            YEAR6 BHUTTO PULLED NO PUNCHES IN                            MAKING HIS PERSONAL REQUEST TO ME RE FOOD ASSISTANCE SAYING IT WAS                            EXTREMELY IMPORTANT TO HIM IN THE ELECTION PROCESS AND IN THE                            ACHIEVEMENT OF HIS HOPES FOR THE FUTURE AS HE HAD OUTLINED THEM TO ME                            HE ASKED IF I WOULD TALK TO YOU PERSONALLY AND FRANKLY ON THIS SUBJECT                            WHEN I WENT HOME AND I SAID THAT I WOULD BHUTTOS HOPES ARE VERY SPECIFIC ALTHOUGH HE ACCEPTS THE                            FACT THAT WE PROBABLY COULD NOT GO AS MUCH AS A MILLION TONS UNDER                            PL480 HIS REQUEST THEREFORE WAS FOR 700 THOUSAND TONS PL480                            250300 THOUSAND IN CC CREDITS I TOLD HIM I WOULD SEE WHAT WAS                            POSSIBLE7 BESIDES THE POLICY QUESTION ON MILITARY SUPPLY WHICH WE HAVE ALREADY                            HANDLED THIS IS ONLY THE SECOND REQUEST OF ME THAT BHUTTO HAS PUT IN SUCH PERSONAL TERMS                            AS I SURVEY THE LOCAL POLITICAL SITUATION THE CONCLUSION SEEMS                            INEVITABLE THAT US INTERESTS WOULD BE SERVED BY THE CONTINUATION IN                            POWER OF BHUTTO OVER THE NEXT FEW                            YEARS FURTHER I DO NOT BELIEVE THAT MEETING HIS REQUEST IN SUCH                            MAGNITUDE WOULD LESSEN HIS RESOLVE TO TAKE FURTHER STEPS TO MAKE                            PAKISTAN SELFSUFFICIENT HE HAS PROVED OVER THE LAST YEAR AND A HALF TO                            BE HIGHLY SUSCEPTIBLE TO OUR SUGGESTIONS ON MATTERS SUCH AS FOOD AND                            FERTILIZER PRICES SO AS TO GIVE INCENTIVE TO THE FARMERS EVEN THOUGH                            THESE HAVE SOMETIMES BEEN POLITICALLY DIFFICULT FOR HIM I REALIZE THE                            TIME FOR DECISION RE NEXT YEARS PL480 ALLOCATIONS IS SOME TIME AWAY                            BUT I WANTED TO GIVE THE POLITICAL ASPECTS OF THIS MATTER TO YOU                            PERSONALLY AT AN EARLY DATE SO THAT THE EVENTUAL DECISION WOULD NOT BE                            OVERLY

IS INCREASINGLY APPARENT                            THAT IT WILL BE VERY DIFFICULT TO REVERSE THE ACTIONS WHICH THE PRIME                            MINISTER HAS TAKEN IN ORDER TO ENFORCE HER CONTROL OF THE GOVERNMENT                            THERE ARE MANY UNCERTAINTIES HOWEVER IN REGARD TO FUTURE ACTIONS WHICH                            SHE MAY TAKE HAVING STARTED OUT ON A COURSE OF CONTROL OF

       THOSE STATES WHERE OPPOSITION PARTIES CONTROL THE GOVERNMENT KERALA AND                            GUJARAT THE QUESTION ARISES AS TO THE PROPER US GOVERNMENT STANCE                            UNDER THE PRESENT CIRCUMSTANCES ANY DECISIONS ON THIS MUST OBVIOUSLY BE                            HIGHLY TENTATIVE2 DURING THIS INITIAL WAITANDSEE PERIOD WE BELIEVE THAT THE US SHOULD

        HAVE EITHER THE CAPACITY OR THE INTEREST TO MATERIALLY AFFECT THE COURSE                            OF EVENTS IN INDIA OUR TENTATIVE ESTIMATE IS THAT THE PRESENT                            GOVERNMENT CAN BE EXPECTED TO REMAIN IN OFFICE THERE WOULD BE LITTLE TO                            BE GAINED BY INTENTIONAL COMMENTS OR ACTIONS WHICH WOULD BE VIEWED BY                            THE

 MISSION HERE IS POLICY GUIDANCE ON WHERE WE ARE HEADED IN LAOS THE                            MISSION HAS DONE EXTREMELY WELL UNDER VERY TRYING CIRCUMSTANCES OVER THE                            PAST MONTH BUT IS CONFRONTED NOW WITH A SITUATION WHICH REQUIRES THE                            MOST URGENT DECISIONS FROM WASHINGTON A GREAT DEAL OF THIS STEMS FROM                            THE PRACTICAL TAKEOVER OF THE PGNU BY THE PATHET LAO AT THE OPERATING                            LEVEL AND WITH ALL MILITARY STRENGTH UNDER COMMUNIST CONTROL2 I CONCLUDE THAT THE PRIMARY IMMEDIATE

COMPLETE TERMINATION OF AID                            AND MAP PROGRAMS IS ESSENTIAL TO THIS                            OBJECTIVE EMBASSY IS SUBMITTING ALTERNATIVE PLANS AND TARGET DATES TO                            GET TO THAT STAFFING LEVEL IT MAY NOT BE NECESSARY TO HOLD TO THE JUNE                            5 TARGET DATE FOR STAFF REDUCTION TO 50 BUT REDUCTION OF PERSONNEL AND                            TERMINATION OF PREVIOUS AID PROGRAMS                            SHOULD BE COMPLETED WELL BEFORE JUNE 30 THE ONLY EXCEPTION WOULD BE A                            CONTINUING FLOW FOR THE TIME BEING OF MAP RICE AND SMALL QUANTITIES OF MAPPOL TO THE FAR UNDER THE FY 75 BUDGET ALLOCATION THESE COMMODITIES                            WILL BE NEEDED IN THE IMMEDIATE FUTURE IF WE ARE LITERALLY

                        MILITARY AID PROGRAM IS SUCH THAT WE CAN TURN IT OFF ON VERY SHORT                            NOTICE AND THAT IS WHAT I PROPOSE WE BE PREPARED TO DO AT JUST THE

MANY SCARCE MANHOURS IT IS ENTIRELY POSSIBLE THAT THESE NEGOTIATIONS                            WILL IN A MATTER OF DAYS PROVE HOPELESS EITHER BECAUSE THE PGNU WILL                            INSIST ON TREATING THE EXTRANEOUS ISSUES THEY INTRODUCED JUNE 2 OR                            BECAUSE THEY WILL INSIST ON INVENTORYING EVERY LAST ITEM THAT USAID                            BROUGHT INTO THIS COUNTRY AT THAT POINT THE ACTING USAID DIRECTOR                            SHOULD BE ABLE TO WALK OUT OF THE NEGOTIATIONS WITHOUT ANOTHER WORD AND                            ABANDON EVERYTHING  ALL

BE WORTH KEEPING                            THE 30PLUS USAID PEOPLE FOR A FEW MORE DAYS BECAUSE THOSE NOT INVOLVED                            IN THE MEETING ROOM WITH RAMSEY WILL BE WORKING ON
