Problems1 Begin summary: Iraqi policies are evolving in a                        direction that could bring about at some point a resumption of diplomatic                        relations between Iraq and the United States It is difficult to predict the                        timing of such an event but we have noted a rather steady expansion in the                        scope of activities permitted to USINT                        and the Iraqi press while still capable of strident antiAmerican polemics                        seems to have reduced somewhat the frequency and vehemence of its attacks on                        the United States It is quite clear moreover that Iraq hopes to reduce                        its previous international isolation and expand its commercial ties with the                        West including expanded business relations with US companies These                        policies will no doubt eventually trigger a resumption in diplomatic                            relations but there are still                        a number of outstanding problems that at the present time would make it                        difficult to establish USIraqi relations on a basis of even minimal                        cordiality But there are also trends at work that may ameliorate these                        problems with the passage of time End summary2 First among the problems that stand in the way of more normal USIraqi                        relations is Iraqs public espousal of the rejectionist front Publicly                        at least Iraq has denounced USGs efforts                        to bring about an ArabIsraeli settlement as a liquidation of Arab rights                        The GOI and its controlled press have                        however been rather selective in picking their targets for attack on this                        issue They have generally concentrated their fire on the Syrian regime                        whom they are always happy to attack with or without a plausible reason                            Hussein and Bakr when speaking                        publicly on this issue have avoided name calling and limited themselves to                        the observation that recent efforts to bring about a settlement will not                        lead to any positive Arab goal In our diplomatic exchanges with FonMin officials we have received hints                        that Iraqi participation in the rejection front is primarily rhetorical                        and that Iraq will not in fact work hard to block movement towards a                        settlement3 Related to Iraqi alignment with the rejection front is Iraqs possible                        support for terrorism Officially the GOI                        denies that it supports terrorism except within the borders of Israel where                        it considers any action against the aggressor Israelis to be justified In                        fact its past conduct and its present association with certain known                        terrorists such as George Habash raise serious questions about the extent                        of Iraqi involvement in terrorist activities4 Perhaps less important but still significant are the problems related to                        Iraqs brutal police state system of internal control The arbitrary                        exercise of power by Iraqi security authorities makes life in Iraq difficult                        for foreigners and Iraqis alike Life is particularly difficult for Iraqis                        who have social or even business contact with foreigners Iraqs lack of                        respect for accepted principles of international comity and lack of due                        process in dealing with real or suspected violators of Iraqi law have                        clouded Iraqs relations with a number of states and will pose continuing                        problems for American firms interested in doing business in this                        country5 Normalization of relations is also hindered by the years of antiUS and                        antiimperialist rhetoric which has had an inevitable impact on the                        attitudes of the Iraqi people particularly the younger generation Although                        the GOI has been known to make major policy                        reversals overnight it doubtedly would need some popular justification for                        a significant alteration in its policies of hostility towards the United                        States6 The developing split between Syria and Egypt may ironically enough                        provide an opening for some improvement in relations between Iraq and the United States Iraq may                        now find common ground with Egypt in its opposition to the Syrian regime and                        there is an increasing parallelism in the reorientation of the two economies                        away from the Soviet bloc and towards the West While the Iraqi regime still                        carries considerably more Marxist ideological baggage than the Egyptian the                        Iraqi leadership is in practice more Arab nationalist than Marxist Its                        devotion to socialism probably has more to do with gaining and exercising                        central control over the disparate elements that constitute Iraq than with                        an ideological commitment to Marxist principles The Baath Party obviously                        has little interest in a dictatorship of the proletariat or of anyone other                        than the Baathi elite and it certainly does not believe in the ultimate                        withering away of the central state7 What the regime does want is a rapid transformation of Iraq into a modern                        industrial and agricultural nation It would also derive tremendous                        emotional satisfaction from the overthrow of the present Syrian regime In                        both these respects it may now perceive a growing identity of interests                        with Egypt and will no doubt watch with great interest the extent to which                        the United States helps Egypt in achieving current Egyptian national goals                        As Iraqs ambitious development program begins to press on the limits of its                        budgetary resources the Baath regime may also become increasingly intrigued                        by the sight of enormous capital transfers from Saudi Arabia and the                        oilrich Gulf states to Egypt It might then conclude that a closer                        alignment with the conservative Arab states would be more conducive to the                        achievement of Iraqs number of national goals of economic development than                        would continued participation in the more radical and more Sovietoriented                        rejectionist Arab grouping8 One major inhibition on Iraqs Westward movement is its continued reliance                        on the Soviet military supply relationship and on East European support for                        Iraqs powerful security and intelligence apparatus Here too however                        there is some movement Westward as Iraq explores arms purchase possibilities                        with France and Great Britain and contracts for security equipment from                        Western European and American suppliers9 All this has certain implications for US policy For one thing we could                        enter into a more active dialogue with the Egyptian leadership on the                        subject of US and Egyptian relations with Iraq We might be able to                        develop triangular commercial relations with Egypt and Iraq that would have                        the effect of building a threeway community of interests We could                        encourage the British and French to sell arms to Iraq and thereby reduce                        Iraqs dependence on the Soviet Union We could ourselves be more                        forthcoming on supplying nonlethal military items to the Iraqi armed forces                        and security services We could find new ways to support US commercial                        interests in Iraq for example we could open up the facilities of the ExIm Bank to American                        companies bidding for Iraqi contracts10 As the Baath Party becomes more absorbed in Iraqs economic development                        and more secure in its own internal power position the problems in                        normalizing relations mentioned at the start of this message should                        ameliorate and the Iraqi regime should become more committed to goals                        similar to our own in the region ie peace stability and expanding                        commerce with the WestWiley	19760320

Secretary on Southern Africa1 Following is summary of long message from Foreign Secretary Callaghan to the Secretary on southern                            Africa received via British Embassy March 15:The letter from Callaghan is attached but not printed2 The Foreign Secretary restated his belief that indigenous influences                            would operate to reduce the internal consequences for Angola of                            SovietCuban intervention This in no way meant that he did not feel as                            strongly as we did about the wider effects of SovietCuban intervention                            Although the success of their intervention in Angola may encourage them                            elsewhere in southern Africa Callaghan thought that given the differing circumstances                            elsewhere there was not necessarily any immediate danger of such                            adventurism The principal worry however is that African perceptions                            of any efforts we might make that appear to prop up Ian Smith or South Africa would be                            colored by the blackwhite aspect of the problem to the complete                            exclusion in the Africans view of any concern with Communist                            intervention3 The task then is to preempt the possibility of further Communist                            involvement so that the problem is never faced The three danger areas                            are Angola Rhodesia and Namibia In Angola the continued presence of                            South African troops and the ensuing possibility of action in the                            Security Council against South Africa could leave HMG in the position of having to go along                            with a resolution calling for South African withdrawal The important                            step is to remove the cause of the possible actions by pressing for                            complete South African withdrawal and HMG to this end is making it clear to SAG that it would not have their support                            in the SC HMG is also joining its EC partners in a forceful dmarche                            to the SAG concerning withdrawal4 On Rhodesia HMG was told in recent                            discussions with Mozambiques FonMin Chissano that the GOM                            believed the point was past where majority rule could be attained                            through negotiations While accepting material and technical aid from                            the Communists for the guerillas Chissano said the GOM                            would not permit the presence of foreign troops unless there was foreign                            intervention on Smiths side Callaghan thought this line of GOM thinking should be encouraged and mentioned HMGs interestfree loan on pounds five                            million to help offset sanctions losses in this regardEven though the odds are turning against it and Smith seems as cagey as                            before Callaghan thought it more                            important than ever that something be done to reach a settlement based                            on early majority rule HMG has made                            clear to Smith that there is no possibility of British support for him                                Callaghan is considering the                            options available for further HMG                            involvement in the search for a settlement The four PresidentsKenneth                                    Kaunda of Zambia Samora                                    Machel of Mozambique Julius Nyerere of Tanzania and Sir Seretse Khama of                                Botswana seem resigned to guerilla activity When he saw                                Banda the Foreign Secretary                            told him he would be willing to visit Nyerere their chairman if he and Banda thought it worthwhile to try and                            devise a package of proposals                            based on early majority rule To date no reply had been received from                            either5 Namibia is the third danger area Even if South Africa is persuaded to                            withdraw its troops from Angola the larger problem of Namibia itself                            remains In Callaghans view the                            essential thing is to get the SAG to                            accept that the transfer of power to the Namibians must come sooner                            rather than laterin his opinion in six months rather than the three to                            four years the SAG seems to be thinking                            of6 Callaghan mentioned our recent                            dmarche on aid to Zaire and ZambiaSee                                    Documents 179 and 180 noting that HMG had decided to give an additional pounds five million                            to Zambia and pounds one million to Zaire He also said HMG had raised the subject with its EC                            partners7 The Foreign Secretary took the occasion to point out that HMG will probably offer some money to the                            Angolans for reconstruction in the belief that this would help restore                            the traditional European position in Angola and serve to offset                            Communist influencesIngersoll	19760323

Bangladesh under the State of Emergency imposed during the November 1975 coup While there was no constitution it noted that the Martial Law Administration MLA did not suppress the rule of law and cited the steady release of political prisoners by the postAugust governments	:Human Rights in Bangladesh	1976-03-29 09:15:00	None	None	TELEGRAMDepartment of StateDACCA 1532EO 11652: GDS TAGS: SHUM

                        Martial Law The Government possesses extraordinary powers and there are                            no effective legal guarantees for the protection of human rights                            However the Martial Law Administration MLA officially considers itself a temporary regime whose                            role is to restore stability law and order and equal justice to the                            country as a prelude to the restoration of representative government On                            this basis the MLA justifies the                            continued ban on political activities and on criticism of its actions                            The MLA does not encourage or condone                            torture or inhuman punishment or degrading treatment or punishment                            although there continue to be occasional reports of rough interrogative                            techniques thus raising doubts that all levels of government are                            sufficiently sensitive to this issue Regarding prolonged detention without charges both the                            previous government of MOSHTAQUE Ahmed and the MLA have together released about 2000 political prisoners                            jailed in the era of Sheikh Mujibur                                Rahman However the MLA                            itself has used vague charges of prejudicial activities to jail some                            political figures none of whom has as yet been brought to trial and                            whose detention may prove to be prolonged On balance the MLAs use of its vast powers has been                            limited But the very existence of Emergency and Martial Laws and the                            lack of adequate legal recourse against their abuse has meant that the                            citizens of Bangladesh are treading warily and few give the MLA cause to invoke its powers END                            SUMMARYINTRODUCTION1 The citizens of Bangladesh lost virtually all guarantee of their                            fundamental rights in a series of government actions which were                            described in detail in references B and C Briefly these actions                            were:A A Special Powers Act SPA which makes most criticisms of the                            government liable to interpretation as prejudicial acts against the                            state and which gives the government extensive powers of arrest and                            detentionB A State of Emergency which suspends fundamental rights and subsequent                            Emergency Powers Rules EPR which remove most checks on the powers of                            arrest and detentionC A constitutional amendment which established a oneparty state under                            a strongly authoritarian president and removed from the Supreme Court                            its jurisdiction over the protection of fundamental rightsAll of these restrictive acts are still in effect added to them is                            Martial Law declared by Moshtaque Ahmed after the August 1975 coup                            against Sheikh Mujibur Rahman                            and continued and expanded by President and Chief Martial Law                            Administrator ASM Sayer following the coup and countercoup of the                            following November The Martial Law Regulations MLR reiterate many of                            the repressive features of the Special Powers Act SPA and the                            Emergency Power Rules EPR and add some further restrictions on the                            human rights of BangladeshisORDINARY LEGAL GUARANTEES2 Bangladesh is currently both in a State of Emergency and under Martial                            Law The State of Emergency was declared on the basis of Article 141 A                            of the Constitution which states that the President may issue a                            proclamation of Emergency if he is satisfied that a grave emergency                            exists in which the security or economic life of Bangladesh is                            threatened by war or external aggression or internal disturbance There                            is no constitutional justification for a state of Martial Law Some                            local lawyers however have remarked that there is a judicial precedent from the Pakistan era for                            the acceptance of the legitimacy of a de facto martial law regime To                            the SPA and the EPR Martial Law Regulations MLR have added these                            further restrictions on ordinary legal guaranteesNo MLR or any action taken by the MLA can                            be called into question or declared illegal or void by any court                            tribunal or authorityMost decisions of the Special and Summary Martial Law courts cannot be                            appealedReview of Martial Law Court decisions rests with the Deputy Chief Martial                            Law Administrators not with the judiciary the president however must                            approve death sentences  In the Martial Law Courts lawyers cannot                            function as advocates and plead cases they may serve only as advisors                            to the defendantsTHE MLA AND HUMAN                            RIGHTS3 Despite its sweeping powers the government does not think its                            citizens are without basic rights President Sayem the former Chief Justice                            emphasizes due process of law the efforts of the MLA to restore the independence and                            integrity of the judiciary and the civil service and the need to return                            to representative government Sayems special assistant retired Justice Abdus Sattar                            moreover has publicly said that The rule of law that has been enshrined in our constitution                            guarantees the fundamental rights as have been enumerated in most of the                            thirty articles of the Declaration of Human Rights There is little                            question that as a government the MLA                            recognizes most of these human rights Nevertheless constitutional                            provisions and government intentions notwithstanding the continuing                            state of Emergency and the Martial Law place the following restrictions                            on human rights:Political organizations and activities remain bannedAny criticism of any kind of the Martial Law its administrators and its                            actions are forbiddenAny citizen can be arrested and detained without warrant for various                            prejudicial or antistate acts or any other of the various offenses                            enumerated in the SPA the EPR and the MLRCitizens are subject to some ex post facto laws and in a few instances to                            double jeopardyThe death penalty can be applied to such crimes as illegal arms                            possession abuse of power smuggling destroying jute stocks                            impersonating military or policemen and causing disaffection among                            mutiny in or hatred toward the armed forcesTHE MLA AND THE                            ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE4 Although public reporting on the hearings is limited the Special and                            Summary Martial Law Courts appear to be rendering verdicts based upon the evidence presented                            There have been acquittals not only of minor figures but also of some                            prominent politicians and we have heard no one criticize the summary                            court proceedings for partiality Overzealousness can perhaps be                            attributed to the prosecution but not to the courts The Draconian                            punishments permitted by the MLR have not been applied often one                            exMinister Abdus Samad was sentenced to life imprisonment as an                            exemplary measure because he was convicted of abusing his high                            position to gain property The only death sentence publicly announced                            was against two men for embezzlement of large amounts of cotton yarn                            during a period was when there was a severe cloth shortage in the                            country Moreover the regular courts have heard appeals filed against                            the government for illegal detention and several of the accused were                            either granted bail or released entirely Lawyers for Gazi Golam                            Mostaffa former Red Cross Chief attempted to raise the issue of double                            jeopardy The government had brought before a Martial Law Court what was                            generally considered a weak case against Gazi for abuse of power and                            corruption before the verdict was announced the MLA filed two more cases against him on the same charge                            His lawyers who argued to the Supreme Court that Gazi could be tried                            only once on the charge apparently lost their appeal because Gazi was                            subsequently convicted in two                            of the cases and acquitted in one but the appeal postponed the                            proceedings for more than a month5 The MLA has made some gestures toward                            the restoration of equal justice It repealed the Collaborators Act by                            which thousands of citizens were incarcerated and deprived of certain                            civil rights for alleged collaboration with the Pakistani army in 1971                            It has also restored to civil servants the right of appeal in dismissal                            cases It has restored citizenship to a number of Bangalees from whom it                            was arbitrarily removed and has announced that citizenship henceforth is                            to be determined only by law It has also repealed the Abandoned                            Property Act and begun restoring property to Bangladeshis who lost it                            principally for political reasonsDETENTION6 Both postAugust governments have released political prisoners In                            October the government decided to release unconditionally all purely                            political prisoners and set up a review board to study the cases of                            political leaders and workers against whom specific charges were                            lodged Under the unconditional category MOSHTAQUE released one                            thousand prisoners The MLA has                            continued this policy and to date has released another 958 people                            following review of their cases although there are complaints from the radical left that the                            process is too slow and all antiMujib detenus should be released The                            Martial Law Courts have also begun clearing the backlog of cases against                            defendants who have been in detention some since 1972 on various                            charges such as illegal arms holding and smuggling7 The MLAs record regarding detention                            however is not spotless because it shares the anxiety of its                            predecessor regimes about the issues of national security and what                            constitutes permissible political activity The MLA has itself been arresting political figures using not                            only the MLR but also the SPA and the EPR as justification The first to                            be arrested were the Jatiyo Samajtantrik Dal JSD leaders for                            antistate activity in November after they had taken credit for the                            Sepoy mutiny and were seen to be stirring up more trouble In the                            following month in apparent dragnets to recover illegal arms more than                            a hundred political workers of the JSD and some from MUJIBs Awami                            League were arrested Since then there have been the announced arrests                            for prejudicial activities of more than a dozen politicians of the                            Awami League NAPMuzaffar the CPB and the JSD Prosecutions against                            the major Awami League politicians arrested in August have been moving                            slowly in large part we hear because the MLA has keen having difficulty collecting evidence that will stand up in court                            Since the MLA is only five months old                            and has been using its powers in a limited fashion it is not possible                            to determine to what extent it will use prolonged detention to control                            political activities it considers threatening However its                            preoccupation with security is so similar to that of MUJIBs and                            MOSHTAQUEs governments and the arrests it has made to date of somewhat                            the same pattern that we would expect that prolonged detention may                            result and the MLA will risk bringing                            cases to court only when it believes it has sufficient evidence for                            convictionsPUNISHMENT8 There is no evidence that the MLA                            either encourages or condones torture degrading treatment or killing                            As we noted in reference C however rough handling is not an unusual                            interrogative technique in the subcontinent One still hears the                            occasional story of police or military attempting to dispose of the                            remains of a detenu who succumbed to questioning While there is no                            record of any security personnel being sentenced to jail for ill                            treating prisoners one of the main concerns of the MLA is restoring discipline to and                            upgrading the calibre of the police force which has been both                            demoralized and corrupted since independence In recognition that a                            problem exists the MLA passed a regulation making it a crime                            to coerce or intimidate citizens through abuse of police powers The                            courts also may be taking a harsher attitude toward such abuses one                            defendant was released because the judge ruled that the police had                            obtained evidence through unjustified use of forceDIPLOMATIC EFFORTS9 The MLA considers that its                            extraordinary powers are temporary and necessary to the restoration of                            stability law and order and respect for law It prides itself upon an                            evenhanded application of justice We have found the most effective way                            to convey our concerns regarding human rights is to repeatedly raise                            with members of government and others of influence the issues of renewed                            political activity and the restoration of representative government the                            validity of criminal charges brought against politicians the grounds                            upon which others are detained for prolonged periods and then fairness                            of the Martial Law Courts and the citizens right of appeal to higher                            authorityCONCLUSION10 The Martial Law Administration presents itself as a nonpolitical and                            neutral interim Government which eschews favoritism and uses its                            extraordinary powers with restraint to correct past abuses and instill a                            respect for law Nevertheless the human rights of Bangladesh are                            protected only by the largesse                            of the government not by enforceable legal guarantees Should the                                MLA choose to use its extensive                            repressive powers there are no legal impediments So far the MLA has managed to avoid the accusation of                            unequal application of justice with one exception  the exercise of                            political rights Inevitably perhaps adherents of the regime of                                Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and of                            the JSD which challenged the authority of the army appear to have less                            scope for political expression than that permitted other groups Once                            again the issue comes down to one mans freedom of expression being                            another mans sedition Attempts at expressing unpopular views however                            have been limited Bangladeshis are fully aware of the powers of the                                MLA and are treading warily Few                            give the government cause to invoke its repressive measuresBOSTER DEB

           PROFESSIONALISM OF THE COMMITTEE OF EXPERTS TO WHICH I RESPONDED THAT                            OUR CONCERN WAS MORE FOR THE CONFERENCE COMMITTEE ON APPLICATION OF

FAMILIAR WITH NUANCES OF DIFFERENCE BETWEEN DEPARTMENTS                            OF STATE LABOR AND COMMERCE I DISCOUNTED THAT7 AT LUNCH I ASKED BLANCHARD WHAT THE SOVIET POSITION WAS ON THE                            UPCOMING ELECTIONS AND ON US POLICY GENERALLY BLANCHARD DESCRIBED                            THEM AS VERY QUIET INDEED I ASKED WHY THAT WAS SO AND HIS ASSOCIATES                            SUGGESTED TWO POSSIBILITIES: 1 FORTIN THAT THE SOVIETS DID NOT WANT                            TO BE BLAMED FOR PRECIPITATING US WITHDRAWAL AND 2 WOLF THAT WITHOUT                            THE US AS A BACKBOARD SOVIET PROPAGANDA EFFORTS IN THE ILO WERE LESS EFFECTIVE AND MEANINGFUL FOR                            OBVIOUS REASONS BLANCHARD EXPRESSED DISPLEASURE WITH THE LATTER                            SUGGESTION8 AFTER LUNCH AT HOROWITZ SUGGESTION I PULLED BLANCHARD ASIDE AND                            PRIVATELY EXPRESSED APPRECIATION FOR HIS ACTIONS DURING THE MIDEAST

CRITICIZED BY THE SOVIETS FOR THAT I ALSO ACKNOWLEDGED THAT THE                            POSITION OF FRANCE HIS COUNTRY WOULD BE OF PARTICULAR                            SIGNIFICANCE9 COMMENT: THERE WAS NO PURPOSE IN COMING ON STRONG WITH BLANCHARD THE                            SITUATION PRESENTS INHERENT PRESSURE I THOUGHT IT MORE USEFUL TO                            REFLECT A SORROWFUL DOWNBEAT ATTITUDE TO ADD TO OUR CREDIBILITY                            FURTHERMORE I DID NOT DISCUSS IN DETAIL OUR 7677 AGENDA BECAUSE I DID                            NOT WANT TO IMPLICITLY SANCTION BLANCHARD AS A MEDIATOR BETWEEN US AND                            OTHER ILO MEMBERS HE IS OF COURSE INFORMED OF OUR DISCUSSIONS WITH                            OTHER COUNTRIES PARTICULARLY FRANCE AND WILL SURELY POSE AS A                            SOPHISTICATED EXPERT ON THE US POSITIONS BUT THE MORE OFF BALANCE THE                            MORE HE IS WORRIED AND THAT ITSELF WILL HAVE A SALUTARY IMPACT ON HIS                            ACTIONS THE ACTIONS OF HIS OFFICE AND MOST IMPORTANTLY ON THE                            EUROPEANS WITH WHOM HE IS IN CONSTANT CONTACT
