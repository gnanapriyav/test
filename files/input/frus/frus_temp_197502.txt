State 029484 and                                029574In telegram 29484 to Phnom Penh                                February 8 Kissinger                                instructed Dean: You should request an                                immediate meeting with Lon Nol                                and tell him that we are considering having American officials in                                Peking seek a meeting with Sihanouk The purpose of the meeting will be to                                explore the possibility of an early compromise settlement in                                Cambodia Ibid State Department Telegrams From SECSTATE Nodis Telegram 29574 to Phnom Penh                                February 8 contained additional details for                                    Dean National Archives RG 59 State Archiving System1 From the messages reftels I was                            asked to transmit to Lon Nol 10                            days ago it is clear that we plan to talk directly with Sihanouk about a political settlement                            for Cambodia I am sure our policy makers are giving a lot of thought to                            what to say to the Prince when the American emissary has his first                            substantive meeting with him On the basis of my nearly one year in                            Cambodia and from talking to people who know the Prince well as well as                            my personal contact with him many years ago when I was stationed in                            Indochina 195356 I suggest that the following ideas be kept in mind                            when talking with Sihanouk2 The Prince less than 1 line not declassified                            is highly emotional about the USG role                            in Cambodia both before and during the war holding us responsible for                            everything that has gone wrong from his point of view Whoever has the                            first substantive contact with Sihanouk must be prepared to listen silently to a                            lengthy and violent diatribe about American wrongdoings in Indochina He might even be                            personally insulted by the Prince as he spews his venom out about                            alleged United States atrocities Anybody who has a low boiling point                            should be prepared for such a scene but should not rebut individual                            allegations because otherwise I fear the conversation will never get                            beyond a shouting match to the important substantive discussion I also                            wish to remind the Dept that Sihanouk has a less than 1 line not                                declassified obsession with the CIA which he holds responsible for much of what has                            happened to him His book ghostwritten for him by Wilfred Burchett in                            1973 entitled My War With the CIA is                            ample proof of his deepseated distrust of the CIA and the exaggerated role he ascribes to it in American                            policy direction and its execution in Cambodia3 Once the American emissary gets to the substantive discussion I think                            it would be wise tactically to appeal to Sihanouks less than 1 line not                                declassified ego We should not reluctantly bargain with him                            but convince him that we are trying to help him get back into Phnom Penh                            as Head of State with real powers so that he rather than the Khmer                            Rouge will be in the drivers seat In short we must imply that perhaps                            we made a mistake in the past but we have now seen the light and that is                            why we are coming to him We should stress that if the Prince comes back                            to Phnom Penh with the Khmer Republics Army Navy Air Force Buddhist                            clergy and government administration intact he would be cast in the                            position of arbitrator with a real power base from which to operate If                            however he insists on the dismantling of the entire republican                            apparatus he would open the door to a Communist takeover and weaken his                            own position He would then be entering Phnom Penh on the tip of KC bayonets and would very soon find himself                            no longer useful to the KC and could even                            be quickly discarded In the interest of strengthening his own position                            and for the sake of the future of Cambodia he must return quickly to                            Phnom Penh while there is still a viable structure on this side Later                            he can make changes to bring the new Cambodia into line with his own                            vision for his country4 We should make it clear to the Prince that the United States is                            basically the only party which can assure him a smooth transition                            because we would try and probably succeed in bringing about the                            departure of those Khmer personalities who are offensive to him We                            could also keep under control the military and civilian elements who                            have been engaged in the fighting for this side so that they would not                            sabotage the agreement which can be worked out with Sihanouk I played a very similar role                            in Vientiane in 1973 when I kept the extreme right at bay while a                            neutralist formula was worked out for Laos5 Hopefully one of the first steps Sihanouk would take as Chief of State in Phnom Penh                            would be the proclamation of a cease fire The months following the end                            of the fighting will be difficult because whoever governs Cambodia must find ways of feeding                            hundreds of thousands of people if not millions until the next crop is                            planted and harvested It will take at least one year perhaps longer                            for Cambodia to become selfsufficient in food again We have some                                PL 480 rice already in the pipeline                            and Congress would probably be willing to authorize the financing of                            additional shipments under the new circumstances to feed the hungry and                            needy It could require as much as 200 million to pay for the rice                            shipments and not many countries are in a position or have the means to                            make such a contribution We could In addition to rice we could supply                            Cambodia with POL spare parts and                            selected raw materials to make Khmer factories and production facilities                            operational again This assistance if offered to Sihanouk would strengthen his own hand                            and make him less dependent on the KC We                            should realize that he will probably want to lean heavily on those who                            supported him for the last five years but our offer would permit him to                            pursue a more nonaligned neutral policy which we understand is his                            goal6 If Sihanouk returns to Phnom                            Penh his safety and that of all those who come with him must be                            assured While some KC forces would                            probably have to enter Phnom Penh to provide security for Sihanouk and his entourage Sihanouks freedom of action would be                            greatly enhanced if some neutral military forces also were temporarily                            stationed in Phnom Penh Sihanouks considerable stature in the nonaligned world                            would probably make it quite feasible and likely that countries such as                            Senegal Algeria Sweden and Singapore would be willing to send troop                            detachments to provide security for Sihanouk These forces would be the best safeguard                            against a bloodbath which might occur as a result of renewed fighting in                            the capital between KC troops and                            diehard republican elements The USG                            certainly has the means to bring such foreign troops into the city                            rapidly and the UN resolution voted on                            November 28 last yearUN General Assembly Resolution 3238                                XXIX Restoration of the Lawful Rights of the Royal Government of                                National Union of Cambodia in the United Nations adopted November                                29 1974 could provide a framework for such an operation I                            think I could convince the authorities on this side to make such a                            request to the UN Secretary General if                                Sihanouk would do the                            same7 The Prince may take the line that the USG should just pack up and go home and let the Khmers                            settle things among themselves If he does I suggest our emissary                            explain to him that this would not really be in his long range interest                            nor in that of his countrymen However we should offer to reduce                            immediately our mission from 200 to a much smaller number whose                            principal function would be to help feed the population and avoid the collapse of the Khmer                            organizations presently existing on this side I think the Prince would                            want to hear from us our offer to cut back drastically our mission so                            that he has something to show to his Communist colleagues We should not                            haggle over numbers8 In practical terms Sihanouks                            return to Phnom Penh might be handled in the following way Lon Nol and a certain limited number of                            key Khmer leaders offensive to Sihanouk are made to depart from Phnom Penh The no 2                            personality in the Khmer Republic Article 32 of the Constitution the                            President of the Senate Saukam Khoy would take over as acting Chief of State Either                            he with the approval of the existing organizations in the Republic                            such as the Senate National Assembly armed forces and the government                            calls on the Prince to return or they acquiesce in it I am not sure I                            can deliver on the former ie a formal invitation to Sihanouk to return but I think I can                            convince them not to oppose Sihanouks return in view of the military                            politicaleconomic situation in the country and the proposition that the                            Princes return will mean peace The Princes first act would be a call                            for a cease fire It would be helpful if this act received the immediate                            endorsement of the UN Security Council                            If Peking goes along with this scenario it means that the Chinese                            prefer to see their man ensconced in Phnom Penh rather than the                            Hanoidominated Khmer Rouge taking the capital by force With Sihanouk Chief of State again other key                            diplomatic missions such as the French Chinese etc should send at                            the earliest possible moment Ambassadors to Phnom Penh their very                            presence would be a restraining influence on extremists on either side                            and that weight is needed especially immediately after Sihanouks return when the situation is                            still fluid9 I am not sure what kind of coalition government the Prince would                            designate but I think he should agree beforehand in Peking to include                            some representatives from the Phnom Penh side in the Cabinet I doubt                            that we will have much influence in determining who would be included in                            such a government but we could at that time propose names of reputable                            efficient Khmers who have proven their worth in the past10 The Prince will probably insist that all humanitarian aid be given                            directly to the Khmer Government so that he and his colleagues get the                            credit that goes with the distribution of these resources Our American                            voluntary agencies may be unacceptable to him If this is the case I                            think the International Red Cross could play a decisive role I have                            talked to the head of the ICRC team                            here when we discussed the possibility of evacuation and he told me                            that some of their team members would probably stay behind regardless of                            what happens While the ICRC has not                            been as efficient as the American voluntary agencies in distributing                            relief supplies they would probably be much more acceptable to the Prince and it would still                            give us some influence over the resources we put at the disposal of a                            future government here11 So much for the talk with Sihanouk What my argument boils down to is that we have                            only one card left to play in Cambodia except for a bugout and that                            is Sihanouk We should make a                            virtue out of an inevitability and build up Sihanouk not reluctantly but willingly I would like to                            believe that Sihanouk can be made                            to understand that it is in his own interest not to insist on the                            complete withdrawal of the USG that to                            the contrary we can inconspicuously help him reimpose his authority on                            the country so that he is not a prisoner of the Communists12 The sooner agreement can be reached with the Prince the better                            position the Prince will be in and the better the chances are that a                            collapse of the existing institutions on this side and a Communist                            military victory can be prevented We are buying time with a civilian                            airlift presently bringing in ammunition and POL for military I doubt very much that the Mekong will be                            reopened in the next week or two and this fact will necessitate bringing                            in some rice from our PL 480 stocks in                            Vietnam to prevent rice stocks from falling below the critical level                            The economic situation is disastrous The government is not collecting                            any revenue and we are not getting any counterpart funds because our aid                            money is used to finance expensive transportation schemes to keep Phnom                            Penh alive Also the closing of the Mekong River has prevented the                            arrival of commodities whose importation generates counterpartThe time we have bought and are buying including hopefully that gained                            by the visit of the congressional delegation must be used to work out                            an orderly settlement in Cambodia I think I can speak for all of the                            key officials in this Mission that they would all be volunteers for                            staying on the job here even under the most difficult circumstances                            including the return of the Prince if it would help bring about such a                            denouement to the Khmer conflictDean	19750218

from Phnom Penh February                                19 Dean asked that the Department keep him                                updated on developments surrounding US overtures to Sihanouk The Ambassador concluded:                                Unless he Lon Nol and I are                                kept informed on which way the USG                                is moving on Cambodia I think it will be difficult for us to keep                                the situation here glued together even long enough for any kind of a                                political settlement to be negotiated with the other side Ibid                                State Department Telegrams To SECSTATE Nodis B Phnom Penh 3041Document 1731 This is to recapitulate for you the series of efforts made over the                            last months to bring about a negotiated settlement in Cambodia Since                            Sept we have pursued various channels with the overriding objective of                            arranging a compromise solution In Sept we broached the idea of an                            international conference on the question with the PRC and the USSR with no response The Secretary also discussed with                            the PRCrepresentative to the UNGA the general elements of a peaceful                            settlement on the basis of a sharing of power What we were seeking was                            to gain Soviet and Chinese support for moves that would bring about an                            end to the hostilities in Cambodia and provide an ongoing political                            framework We received no substantive positive response to these                            overtures2 During the Secretarys trip to China in late November he spoke to                                PRC officials with great specificity                            about the possibility of a peaceful settlement of the war in Cambodia                            Once again he indicated our readiness to see a compromise settlement in                            which all elements could play a role including Sihanouk and said that we were not                            wedded to any personalities The Chinese showed no more interest in                            pursuing the subject than they had previously and nothing was

facilitate a channel                            through UNGA President Bouteflika to                            representatives of the Khmer Rouge The Secretary spoke to Bouteflika                            about the desirability of a peaceful settlement and the factors                            involved Nothing came of thatSee ibid                                volume E14 Part 1 Documents on

the French Manach reported that as a result                            of conversations with Sihanouk and                            the Chinese he believed Sihanouk                            was prepared to see a peaceful settlement with a government being formed                            under his authority and composed of a coalition of various elements The                            President discussed the matter with Giscard in Martinique and the Secretary met with                            highlevel French representatives in Washington to lay out the elements                            of a settlement to be explored with Sihanouk in accordance with the views he had expressed                            to Manach Sihanouk agreed to                            receive a high level French intermediary armed with our views but the                            Chinese were not willing to issue the necessary visa Sihanouk then told Manach the visit                            would have to be postponed but it was clear that the postponement was                            indefinite Sihanouk explicitly                            attributed this change of mind to opposition from the Khmer RougeFor a fuller discussion see Kissinger Years                                    of Renewal pp 5115125 Our latest effort of which you are aware was an attempt to establish                            direct contact with Sihanouk                            ourselves We sought to do so through the Chinese whose assistance is                            essential to the effort They have so far given us no response Thus                            there are no new developments in our efforts either to establish contact                            with Sihanouk or to pursue the                            earlier French initiative6 With regard to our latest effort to make direct contact it is                            conceivable that the Chinese were waiting for Sihanouk to return from Hanoi and it is still possible                            that we will receive a reply But for the moment this is sheer                            speculation and provides no basis for policy decisions or actions7 You should understand that in these efforts we have made clear to the                            Chinese and to Sihanouk that we                            are fully in accord with the objective of seeing formed in Cambodia a                            government under his authority composed of all tendencies except                                Lon Nol We have said that any                            settlement must offer assurance of durability and that if an agreement                            could be reached on the objective of a settlement we were confident that                            a way to achieve it could be found The absence of a positive response                            for which we presume Khmer Rouge opposition is a key factor indicates                            they they clearly prefer pursuing a military course8 In sum in all of these cases our efforts were rebuffed Under these                            circumstances lectures on the subject of pursuing a negotiated                            settlement are inappropriate You may be sure that we will inform you of                            new reactions if they occur But you must understand that we cannot                            create such developments overnight in the face of obvious Communist                            confidence in their military position on the spot particularly with the                            closure hopefully temporary of the Mekong What is needed from you to                            contribute to our negotiating objectives is a steady hand in Phnom Penh                            to shore up the GKR as a government and                            as a fighting force Your role is of key importance both in terms of how                            the US appears to the Khmer and in terms                            of giving the congressional group when it comes an impression of                            steadiness and confidence9 This is all for your information only If in your judgment you must                            tell Lon Nol something you should                            tell him simply that so far we have been unable to make contact with                                Sihanouk in Peking and do not                            know whether this is because of his trip to Hanoi or

                   Situation1 Without rehashing all of our assessments since last June of the                            probable course of events in Cambodia which could be summarized as                            predicting that the whole situation was likely to go downhill after                            December 1974 I believe it incumbent to alert you that we may now be                            approaching the crunch point I am not in the habit of crying wolf so                            it is only reluctantly that I wish to warn you that the fighting ability                            and morale of the FANK is                            deteriorating Around Phnom Penh City the enemy has fixed FANKs strongest division the Third in                            its normal sector in the southwest This creates the possibility that                            the enemy will now try to launch a major offensive against our only                            remaining lifeline to the outside worldPochentong Airfieldand against                            the primary ammunition storage depot nearby at Kantouk There exist no                            remaining FANK reserves to throw into                            the fray against an enemy attack of this kind Military reverses on the                            lower Mekong and in the provincesfor example the fall of the                            historical capital of Oudong yesterday and of the rice center of Muong                            Russei a few days agohas accelerated the decline in Khmer morale2 It is by no means certain that FANKs                            forces can continue to contain the enemy around Phnom Penh and an enemy                            breakthrough somewhere on the perimeter is a distinct possibility On                            the lower Mekong one of the two enclaves established by FANK fell yesterday Sierra One which                            means that only one government position Sierra Two remains south of                            Neak Luong all the way to the border with South Vietnam It is now                            exceedingly difficult for the Khmer Navy to resupply that one outpost                            Even the nightly convoys from Phnom Penh to Neak Luong have had a                            difficult time making the trip without severe losses3 We must be realistic and accept the fact that FANK does not at the present time have the forces to place                            on the banks of the lower Mekong in order to suppress enemy heavy                            weapons fire against any convoy which tries to run the gauntlet up from                            South Vietnam There is no indication that such forces will become                            available anytime soon What this means is the closure for the                            foreseeable future of the lower Mekong to navigation Intelligence                            indicates that the enemy is now planning to seed with mines the Mekong                            north of Neak Luong4 The morale of both the Khmer civilian and military leadership is at an                            alltime low They are aware of the USGs continuing determination to support them as exemplified                            by the airlift into Pochentong of military and civilian matriel and                            above all by the Presidents and your own strong pleas to the Congress                            to provide supplementary assistance for Cambodia5 I am not sure however that even a favorable vote on supplementary                            assistance can turn this situation around As the military situation has                            been deteriorating the Khmers unfortunately have become more interested                            in pointing fingers at each other trying to fix the blame on someone                            else than in sticking

out their differences The civilians                            have refused to attend I am now trying to reschedule this meeting for                            tomorrow In a separate message I will report the difficulties                            encountered in trying to arrange this meeting and give an outline of                            what I intend to say to the Khmer leadership when they can be gathered                            together to help them regain a sense of steadiness and                                selfconfidenceTelegram 3538 from

            civilian and military actors together under his leadership6 Even if we muddle through for another couple of weeks until the                            supplementary assistance can be voted on the prospects facing us for                            the coming weeks are a continuation of the military setbacks and of the                            inability of the Khmers to organize themselves effectively to cope with                            the mortal danger facing them The Americans on the scene are doing all                            we can to help the Khmers but we can not work miracles7 I think as far as the USG is                            concerned our goal is to show the world that we have faced up to our                            obligations We have done this through the airlift of civilian and                            military matriel and through the determined efforts of the President and the entire                            executive branch to obtain the supplementary assistance the GKR needs in order to survive If this                            effort is successful and the Congress votes the necessary funds it will                            further reflect our determination to help the Khmers But I fear that                            despite everything the 200 man American Mission in Cambodia is doing                            right now the news from the military front will not improve over the                            next few weeks8 The Khmers are fully are fully aware that they themselves are in no                            position to negotiate with the Khmers on the other side For all                            practical purposes they have turned this task over to the USG I reluctantly conclude that if any                            uncontrolled solution is to be avoided we must establish contact with                                Sihanouk despite all the                            obstacles in the way so that he can return to Cambodia while there is                            still an army navy air force and government in being in Phnom Penh                            This would probably require the elimination in advance of the present                            leadership in Cambodia but it is the only way a solution can be found                            which is anything other than an eventual collapse of the nonCommunist                            side9 I fully understand the problems you are facing in getting an emissary                            to talk with Sihanouk at a time                            when the KC military are holding the                            upper hand in Cambodia However following a favorable vote on                            supplementary assistance I should think that the Assistant Secretary                            for East Asian Affairs could obtain a visa to go to Peking in order to                            discuss with Sihanouk the means of                            working out a controlled solution It really boils down to this: have we                            lived up to our commitment by merely providing the material means for                            the FANK and the GKR to survive or do we have some moral                            responsibility to help the Khmers on this side find a controlled                            settlement If we do not pursue the latter course and despite                            everything we do here on the spot and you do in Washington I fear that                            Operation Eagle Pull will be the manner in which the United States                            departs sooner rather than later from CambodiaOperation Eagle Pull was the name of the military

                    next week there are a few conclusions which I have reached as a result of                        my meetings in Tehran which I thought I should share with you right                        away2 There is a substantial possibility for development of a common position                        between the US and Iran on many oilrelated issues a far greater                        possibility than with any of the other OPEC countries which I have visited Iran takes a practical                        view of the oil situation basing its judgements on economic considerations                        rather than on the relationship of oil to the ArabIsrael conflict To the                        extent it does inject politics it is anxious to sustain its relationship                        with the West on whom it is increasingly dependent economically                        politically and militarily With respect to a consumerproducer conference                        there is no interest in exacerbating relations between producers and                        consumers want to avoid interchange of extraneous raw material issues and                        is attempting to restrain the more radical oil producers Its goals are to                        find a method of avoiding the erosion of the purchasing power of its oil                        revenues through inflation or exchangerate fluctuations perhaps to realize                        a more secure climate for its investment and to find an improved means of                        international cooperation to assist developing countries It is clearly                        desirous of improved cooperation with the US in preparations for the                        conference3 While there are a number of areas in which improved cooperation can take                        place including particularly the many projects which we have agreed can be                        promptly realized in the Joint Commission framework there are three                        important policy areas where prompt action by the US could achieve major                        benefits for us:1 The US needs to develop a position in response to OPEC concerns that inflation is eroding the                        purchasing power of oil revenues The Iranians are working on a proposal for                        indexation While I am skeptical that an indexation proposal acceptable to                            OPEC will be acceptable to us or that                        indexation is technically feasible we ought to at least explore what a                        proposal satisfactory to us might look like Certainly the OPEC countries will have such a proposal by                        the middle of March and we should have one as well If we conclude that                        indexation is technically impossible or that market forces will bring down                        the price of oil so that any indexation however viable technically should be                        resisted we might at least consider possibility for developing a technical                        level consultative process between consumers and producers which examines                        the impact of inflation the policies nations are using to curtail it and                        the ways in which producers might act to counter its impact on their                        development objectives This would institute a process for a commitment to                        indexation but would permit the possibility of an increase in oil prices                        based on consultation rather than unilateral action2 We might raise with OPEC countries the                        possibility of agreement to begin a dialogue between developed and                        developing countries on raw materials OPEC especially Algeria is under pressure from nonoil                        producing developing countries to avoid neglecting raw materials in any                        conference with the industrialized nations Agreement to a separate future                        conference perhaps at the technical level at first on raw materials might                        make it easier to remove this subject from the consumerproducer oil                        conference It would moreover be consistent with your desire to develop an                        American initiative in this area3 There is a distinct possibility that the US proposal for a trust fund in                        the IMF can be married with the Shahs                        proposal for a trilateral development fund We believe a compromise can be                        reached which would include the funding scheme incorporated in our trust                        fund proposal the trilateral board of governors proposed by the Shah use                        of the staffs of the IMF and IBRD contained in both plans and the emphasis                        on balance of payments assistance contained in the trust fund plan Such a                        proposal would include OPEC countries in a                        multilateral aid scheme which would be more helpful from our point of view                        than their present emphasis on bilateral aid which often has political                        strings avoid the appropriation problems through use of IMF gold and put a strong plus in our                        relations with the Shah Amouzegar                        was receptive to this suggestion for attempting to combine the two schemes                        If we could have a basic proposal to him before he departs on February 25 to                        meet with other OPEC countries on this                        subject he might try it out Time is therefore of the essence and if we                        are to get this proposal before OPEC we                        would need to move immediately I suggest you have EB draw up a proposal                        for your consideration by Saturday evening so that we could go over it                        together

            Department please pass this highly sensitive message personal for the                            Secretary from Kubisch1 Over the weekend I have had very private discussionsseparatelywith                            three of the four ministers who together with CARAMANLIS make up the                            real inner power structure of the Greek Government: Defense Minister                                Averoff Economic                            Coordination Minister Papaligouras and Foreign Minister Bitsios The fourth George Rallis who                            is Minister to the Prime Minister works primarily on internal political                            and press matters2 I get the strong impression that with the exception of Bitsios who has made almost a                            diplomatic and writing career out of Cyprus CARAMANLIS and his inner                            circle want very much to have done with the Cyprus problem They simply                            have too many other major problems to address and solve in Greece The                            Priest as they call Makarios                            gives them a pain and somehow a more stable and tranquil modus vivendi                            with Turkey must be found to give them the breathing space they need to                            proceed with the internal rehabilitation this country still                            requires3 Bitsios on the other hand                            still seems mesmerized by the Cyprus problem and appears still to be                            advocating the kind of rearguard holding action on Cyprus and the                            toolittle toolate piecemeal concessions to the Turks that have                            characterized Greek policy for years with such dismal results4 In any case it has been suggested to me that you consider making a                            new and major move now to break the deadlock on a Cyprus settlement                                Averoff his name must                            protected in this told me that he is confident that Greece will accept                            a bizonal federated system on Cyprus if the Turks will reduce their                            zone to 25 percent of the island which would still comprise                            approximately 35 percent of the economic activity and resources on                            Cyprus He also told me that he had information from a reliable Turkish                            informant that Turkey was prepared to reduce to 25 percent in exchange                            for a Greek acceptance and international endorsement of the twozone                            arrangement As for Makarios                                Averoff said he would resist                            mightily but that Greece could make him go along5 The specific suggestion is as follows: you send a very private                            personal message to the GOT saying you                            are prepared to try and get the Greeks to accept the bizonal system but                            you need to hold out a really major Turk concession to them in order to                            have any chance of success You suggest that the Turks agree to draw                            back to 22 percent of the island which is still more than their                            population ratio and you would be prepared to give it a try the Turks                            will say no counter with 6 I am not recommending that you do this at this stage but I do believe                            it deserves your careful consideration There are obvious pitfalls: if                            you try and fail it will surely leak and the Kissinger Plan to sacrifice Cyprus for                                NATO bases Congressional strategy                            or whatever will be denounced on all sides At the same time if you                            succeed many Greeks and Greek supporters will attack you for selling                            out Cyprus and the Greek Cypriots for the sake of some nefarious scheme                            or strategy of yours Still if it works it could help greatly in                            repairing our relationship with Turkey get Congressional restrictions                            lifted allow Greece to attend to its internal problems preserve the                            main bonds of the alliance flank and soothe a major world trouble                            spotall without the intrusion of undesirable third parties7 Perhaps you can feel your way into this somewhat tentatively with the                            Turks and if it leads to something worthwhile and specific then send                            me in to see CARAMANLIS directly and privatelybypassing Bitsios Bitsios would not like it and you and I would both pay                            a price with him for doing it but it may be the only way It would not                            have to be billed as a Kissinger                            proposal but simply as one more effort on your part to try and assist                            two allies to get together8 One final note of caution: you have no doubt seen less than 1 line not declassified reportsand my comments                            thereonabout coup plotting in Greece possibly involving Averoff While I continue to believe                            these reports should be substantially discounted they cannot be                            dismissed altogether Averoff in                            his Defense Ministry post is in a key  position I have no reason to doubt his solidarity                            with and loyalty to CARAMANLIS but one can never be sure He may be                            playing his own game and trying to pave the way both for a Cyprus                            settlement and our support in the event he decides to ally himself with                            others This is one more reason to feel your way carefully into the                            terrain indicated above should you decide to go aheadKubisch	19750217

                           facilities In turn the US side described the benefits of US                                military bases and the presence of the Sixth Fleet to Greek security                                interests and expressed an understanding of the Greek desire to                                modify privileges and immunities as well as Greek access to US                                facilities National Archives RG 59 Central Foreign Policy Files                                19751 After a slow start caused principally by lack of clear guidelines                            and preparation on the Greek side our talks about bilateral military                            agreements and US facilities in Greece are beginning to come into focus                            The Feb 12 meeting reftel provided clear insights into what the Greeks                            regard as key problem areas As the Greek side indicated the complaints                            they articulated yesterday may be supplemented by others as the                            discussions proceed but there is little doubt at this stage that Greek                            discomfort is more political than functional and that the US facilities                            and operating procedures which trouble them most are paradoxically                            those which A are most conspicuous and B least conspicuous2 Thus US facilities at Hellenikon Athenai air field Elefsis and to                            a lesser extent Soudha create problems for the Greek Govt because they                            are prominent and well publicized installations two of which are                            located in the immediate vicinity of metropolitan Athens The Greek                            negotiator stated unequivocally that the GOG intends to reassert its sovereignty over Hellenikon and                            the site of Elefsis terminating homeporting in the process The                            discussions seemed to indicate room for compromise on Hellenikon but                            the Greeks were not particularly responsive on homeporting although                            they acknowledged the importance of the Sixth Fleets presence in the                            Eastern Mediterranean In the case of inconspicuous indeed virtually                            unknown facilities operated by the US in Greece 1                                line not declassified the problem for the Greeks is reversed                            That is it is the discreet nature of these facilities and the limited                            knowledge of them within the Greek Govt which makes Greek officials                            uncomfortable3 Characterizing the Greek sensitivities in this way suggests two lines                            of possible compromise As far as Hellenikon is concerned we believe                            there is a fair chance that the Greek Govt can be convinced that US                            facilities there at least in part serve their defense needs and should                            be retained It will however be necessary to examine carefully ways in                            which marginal services at Hellenikon can be dispersed or relocated and                            ways in which Greek sovereignty can at least nominally be asserted over                            the facility by incorporating it into the Hellenic Air Force base at                            Hellenikon Concerned Washington agencies should begin promptly to                            examine this problem so that we can formulate some alternative solutions                            to the Greek problem which do not create intolerable inconveniences for                            US A similar approach may be possible in the case of Soudha although                            we infer that the Greeks are less concerned about the American profile                            of Soudha than about the possibility persuading US to pay something for                            it in the form of expanded Hellenic Air Force facilities there Although                            the Greeks were not encouraging about homeporting we believe it might                            be possible to retain usage rights at the Elefsis pier for                            nonhomeported units of the Sixth Fleet although the homeporting                            arrangement would probably have to be considerably revised or replaced                            entirely4 Regarding the mosaic of inconspicuous but in many cases important                            facilities such as Tatoi we believe that our approach should be double                            pronged On the one hand we will have to satisfy the Greeks that the                            basic functions of these facilities most of which are communications                            assets of one kind or another do not derogate Greek sovereignty or                            involve Greece in unacceptable risks with their neighbors and on the                            other hand convince them that the facilities directly or indirectly                            serve Greek defense needs The Greek officials with whom we are                            negotiating are suspicious of these facilities in part because they know                            so little about them It should therefore be possible to satisfy the                            Greek Govt that the facilities serve a valid purpose and are covered by                            valid agreements without opening the doors wide or declassifying the                            facilities In most cases it should be possible to pacify Greek                            anxieties by means of sanitized briefings and by visits to the                            installations by authorized Greek representatives5 The latter obligation is one which we cannot avoid and should not try                            to avoid We expect that the Greek side will soon request a tour of US                            facilities This could come within a matter of days depending upon the                            sense of urgency felt by the Greeks We will need prompt clearances from                            Washington from the agencies concerned to their Mission counterparts                            authorizing guided tours and briefings when requested Any delay in                            responding to a Greek request would exacerbate Greek suspicions and                            unnecessarily complicate the negotiating process For this reason we                            will need contingency clearances to conduct guided tours of certain                            classified facilities and component elements of the Mission early next week will send                            messages identifying the facilities which we think the Greeks will want                            to see and outlining the type of sanitized briefing we have in mind6 After three days of intensive talks it is our tentative conclusion                            that the Greeks will seek changes in our operating relationship which                            are more than cosmetic but less than vital It is encouraging that the                            Greek side does not challenge the basic assumption that bilateral                            military cooperation with the US is important for Greece and that in                            the wider context of our regional responsibilities an effective US                            military role is positive and stabilizing We believe that assumption                            underlies the thinking not only of the Greek negotiating team but of the                            Greek Govt itself Without it a true meshing of our interests would be                            impossible With it there may still be difficult problems of detail but                            the eventual conclusion of our negotiations with the Greeks would be                            satisfactory both for us and for them KubischIngersoll	19750213

31753In telegram 31753 to the Mission in Geneva February                            13 the Department agreed to the desirability of maintaining the                            separation of the London grain reserves talks from the Geneva                            multilateral trade negotiations for the present with eventual link                            between the two to be established at a later time The Department also                            instructed: Should EC or others raise                            subject of a separate grains group in MTN US Del to TNC should                            reserve its position pending further consideration of this issue by                            Washington agencies Ibid B London 2147In telegram 2147 from London February 11 the Embassy                            reported on a February 10 grain reserves meeting and discussed the                            relationship between the London grain reserves meetings and the Geneva                            trade negotiations Ibid For Seidman White House from Malmgren1 Hijzen chief EC negotiator explained to Malmgren late last night that on basis MalmgrenSoames discussion in Brussels SundayFebruary 9EC Council had dropped concept that all of                        agriculture had to be dealt with exclusively in one agricultural body in the                        Trade Negotiations Committee TNC It was                        consequently made possible to allow USG and                        other nations to discuss whole of tariff schedule including agricultural                        chapters in a tariff group and general trade questions including                        agriculture in NTB groups However under                        this compromise proposal the EC had to have                        the right to ask for special consideration of the agricultural issues from                        time to time in an agricultural context This would ensure for the USG the right to discuss the whole range of                        trade issues in each body but also ensure the right of the EC to look at agricultural elements of each                        issue from the point of view of special aspects of agriculture2 Malmgren and Hijzen then ad referendum and on personal                        basis only agreed on creation of tariff working party standards working                        party subsidies working party and other substantive issues working                        parties to be determined by summary of TNC                        Chairman Long In addition at                            Hijzens request it would be                        noted that discussion was needed of certain agricultural product areas such                        as grains meat and dairy and for this special groups would be needed                            Comment: This of course was consistent with                        standing Washington position allowing establishment cereals and meat groups                        and also of compromise proposals                        of USDA End                        comment Hijzen said he had to                        have commodity groups for purpose of compromise To allow special                        agricultural reviews to take place from time to time there would be in                        parallel with all other working parties working party on agricultural                        problems primarily but not solely concerned with subgroup activities on                        grains meat dairy etc3 This compromise met US instructions by ensuring nonexclusive parallel                        treatment of agriculture It ensured that agriculture would be dealt with in                        conjunction with industry as provided in Section 103 of the Trade Act4 New instructions from Washington reftel A explained by phone during night Malmgren met with Hijzen at 7:30 GVAGeneva time to persuade Hijzen to give up requirement of grain                        group Hijzen conceded he could give                        up for the moment establishment of cereals group if no other subgroups in                        agriculture established at that time Instead he could keep to compromise                        formula above if agricultural working party established without saying now                        much about its future work He suggested in this case to ease objections                        of French that we set up one NTB working                        party to meet on series of NTBs perhaps                        in subgroups as decided by Director General Long Nonetheless tariff and NTB working parties would be allowed to go into agricultural                        aspects and US would retain its basic position5 We strongly recommend approval this procedure It meets all of US                        objectives including desire in most recent instruction to avoid                        establishment of grains group Malmgren believes no other possible arrangement is any                        longer negotiable and further believes confrontation would be undesirable                        since all US objectives are met6 Require guidance or approval by no later than 0900 Washington time or                        1500 Geneva time today Wednesday February 12Dale	19750212

Request you deliver the following letter from President Ford to Prime Minister Miki2 Begin text Dear Mr Prime Minister: Our two                        governments are now working with the other members of the International                        Energy Agency to complete an overall framework of consumer country                        cooperation on financial solidarity energy conservation and the accelerated                        development of new energy supplies We have already reached agreements on                        the first two of these We must now complete our overall cooperative efforts                        with basic understandings on our approach to accelerated developmentAs I see it our common policy on accelerated development should fulfill the                        following requirements It should assure rapid development of available                        energy opportunities in the consuming countries without giving investors a                        wholly riskfree opportunity It should allow for the diversity in energy                        opportunities among the consuming countries while recognizing that all                        consuming countries will benefit equally from the market impact of increased production of                        energy by any one of them And it should create a basis on which stable                        economic and political relationships can be negotiated with the producing                        countriesAt my request Secretary Kissinger                        has advanced a set of proposals for consumer cooperation on accelerated                        development These proposals include a commitment by members of the                        International Energy Agency to provide protection against future price                        uncertainty for investors in conventional nuclear and fossil fuels in our                        countries either by a common floor price or tariff an agreement setting                        forth the general terms and conditions under which member countries could                        participate in each others programs to develop synthetic fuels and other                        higher cost energy sources and a similar agreement under which two or more                        member countries could pool their energy research and development efforts in                        specific areas and projectsWithin this framework it should be possible to assure an equitable balance                        of cost and benefits among participating countries Countries with large                        fossil fuel potential would achieve greater selfsufficiency but would have                        to assume the larger share of the investment burden Countries whose                        principal domestic energy opportunity is increased nuclear power would                        obtain the balance of payments and fiscal benefit of lower oil pices as                        investment in other parts of the IEA                        resulted in lower world prices We would all agree not to increase our                        consumption of imported oil if prices fellI understand that countries such as Japan which have relatively little                        domestic potential to develop fossil fuels might be concerned over the need                        to assure that they would have access to the new energy supplies produced in                        other IEA countries under such a framework                        of cooperation We understand this concern and believe that in an effort to                        strengthen our overall cooperative framework we should examine the merits                        of possible undertakings regarding access to supply and to markets for                        energy produced within our countriesI am optimistic that we will be able to make substantial progress in this                        area within the next few weeks and thus that we will be in a position to                        hold a preparatory meeting by the end of March for the formal dialogue with                        the oil producing countries Clearly we will not be able to reach detailed                        agreement on all aspects of our cooperation in accelerated development by                        the end of MarchHowever I believe we must reach a firm understanding on the basic elements                        and principles of our overall approach on accelerated development before                        beginning discussions with the producers We cannot hope to achieve                        agreement with producers on the elements of a longterm equilibrium of                        interests between us unless we as consumers have firmly established our own                        common measures of cooperation in this important area of our overall                        cooperative effortI would like to take this opportunity to convey to you personally my                        appreciation for the positive contribution Japan is making to the work of
