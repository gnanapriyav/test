Bahrains authorities might reverse their                            decision to terminate the agreement allowing MIDEASTFOR to use Bahrain as its                            home port and instructed the Embassy to inform Iran of the problems                            that would ensue if the force were abruptly withdrawn Ibid RG 59 Central Foreign Policy Files

       advice on line GOI might take with GOB should Iranian MFA ask for our suggestions End                            summary2 On July 10 Ambassador saw Court Minister Alam for discussion of future of MIDEASTFOR at Bahrain Ambassador                        presented letter which drew on reftel                        and other sources to make following points:1 Apparent GOB inclination to reverse                        decision on termination of agreement 2 GOBs interest in Iranian and Saudi views 3 radical elements on Bahrain 4 increasing                        Soviet activity in Gulf area and 5 utility of MIDEASTFOR presence in connection with                        latter two points Letter expressed hope GOI shared these US interests and asked for Irans views Copy                        of letter pouched NEAIRN3 During ensuing conversation Ambassador discussed at length implications                        of heightened Soviet activity in Persian Gulf and observed that we were                        aware that public GOI position on regional                        security might create problems for Iran should it wish to assist with MIDEASTFOR Gist of Alams reply was that Iranian public                        position notwithstanding it would be terrible for US Navy to leave                        Persian Gulf at time when Soviets were augmenting their presence and                        activities4 During evening same day Alam                        called Ambassador to advise that Shah had read letter and directed that                        necessary steps will be taken Matter had been referred to Foreign                        Minister who would study agreement to ascertain whether there might be                        some clause that would allow for deviation We are not clear what this                        means It may mean that Alam had                        reference to an agreement between Iran and Bahrain that was drawn up at time                        of Bahrain independence It may also mean that MFA will be looking at homeporting agreement to determine                        whether there might be some loophole through which it might suggest GOB could slip to escape termination                        decision5 On July 11 DCM called Nadim at MFA who confirmed that Ministry was seized                        with problem and that Foreign Minister would be in touch with us on July                        136 Please let us know by Niact Immediate cable if Department or Manama have                        any suggestions of legal loopholes in the homeporting agreement or other                        points to be made with GOB which we might                        pass to Foreign Minister It is possible that MFA will have its own ideas but it may look to us for                        assistance in handling task imposed by Shah Whether or not suggestions are                        legally sound would not be the main point It would seem to us sufficient                        for Iran to have some substantive and reasonably convincing advice to pass                        to the GOB which would implicitly convey                        Irans endorsement of retention of MIDEASTFOR at BahrainTelegram 5715                            from Tehran July 12 reported that Foreign Minister Khalatbari agreed to be helpful on                                MIDEASTFOR and would send an                            envoy to Bahrain Ibid D7401860890 In telegram 152059 to Tehran                            July 14 the Department suggested that the Bahrainis be told that                            despite Iranian disapproval of foreign naval forces in the Gulf Iran                            believed that the US Navy should stay given

frus1969-76v27d66	66 Telegram From the Department of State to the Embassy in Iran	None	1974-07-15 22:48:00	None	None	152797 Subject: Oil Prices1 We believe that it is timely to renew dialogue with Iran on oil price                        issue and that the GOI decision to apply                        the two percent royalty increase provides an opportunity to do soAt OPECs most                            recent meeting in Quito Ecuador June 1517 members voted for a 2                            percent increase in royalties We do not feel however that                        entering into debate on rationale Iran and other OPEC members use to justify price rise would be profitable We                        are convinced that high cost of oil is responsible for considerably more                        than the one percent of the inflation rate which OPEC has averred 23 percent is probably more accurate and                        thus represents significant portion of total inflation rate Also comparing                        rates of price increases of oil and selected commodities is statistically                        fallacious More pertinent would be a comparison of complex price indices of                        total imports versus exports of oil producers However we recognize that at                        this time emphasis on such matters in which each side has its set of                        statistics would bog down dialogue Therefore we wish to turn discussion                        to broader economic and political consequences threatening economy of world                        and especially of West with whose prosperity and security Irans fortunes so                        closely tied2 You are requested therefore to seek opportunity to discuss with                        appropriate senior official the oilrelated economic problems now facing the                        industrialized world If you talk with Amouzegar you could note our appreciation for his frank                        comments on Quito meetingReported in telegram                            5509 from Tehran July 5 National Archives RG 59 Central Foreign Policy Files D7401780563                                Amouzegar was Irans                            representative at the OPEC                            meeting The OECD forecasts                        following BP deficits in 1974: France 65                        billion Italy 75 billion Japan 75 billion UK 11 billion and predicts similar though smaller deficit                        rate in the first half of 1975 These deficits are largely a function of                        1973 oil price rises In most OECD                        countries growth rates in 1974 have dropped sharply with the OECD average growth rate in 1974 forecast at                        only 05 percent In several cases 1974 growth rate likely to be zero or                        negative Improvement is forecast for 1975 but growth rates will still be                        lower than normal Again oil prices as well as uncertainties about oil                        supply have been major contributors to this change in pattern3 A major effect of the large 1973 oil price rises has been and will                        continue to be a draining of capital resources from the industrialized                        countries of the nonCommunist world and into the accounts of oil producers                        Capital has thus been diverted from traditional investment channels control                        over funds now resides in hands that in the main do not have the resources                        to use them fully Some producers such as Iran are being helpful in                        recycling their oil incomes into the world economy but vast amounts of                        capital formerly available for investment and growth throughout the world                        remain unavailable4 In some ways more worrisome than the economic problems growing out of oil                        price increases are the related political problems Italy is a case in                        point where economic problems pose the strongest danger to democratic                        government in some twenty years with all it could imply for NATO and the Common Market The shock of the                        oil price rises and the attendant balance of payments deficit have been                        major contributors to the political deterioration in Italy5 We do not desire to enter into debate with Iran over the rights or wrongs                        of the oil price rises or over need for adjustments in world economic                        patterns to take better account of the needs of developing countrieswhether                        oil producers or not Fact remains however that world economy is                        interdependent The Shah has himself referred to that interdependence and                        specifically to the vital importance to Iran of a stable Western Europe and                        to the inseparability of European regional security from that of Irans own                        part of the world We are sure that Iran understands that neither it nor its                        friends could profit from sustained economic or political weakening of                        Western countriesnor for that matter of the less developed countries6 We believe that ways must be found for the Western and world economies to                        recover from the blow of the 19734 price rises We do not wish to argue                        that oil prices should not have risen at all in face of increases in prices                        of various other goods and commodities in international trade However                        enormous increase of oil prices in short time span based in large part in                        artificial market conditions connected with Arab oil embargo has created                        severe disequilibrium Time is needed to make the fundamental adjustments                        necessary to deal with increased oil price levels We believe that major oil                        producers have a responsibility to ensure adequate supplies for consumer                        requirements at prices which bear reasonable relationship to economic                        market value and which at same time provide reasonable return to producers                        The alternative can be disaster which eventually could engulf both                        producers and consumers7 This is a matter which compels most careful attention by both Iran and                        United States The increasing breadth and profoundness of our common                        interests and our collaboration and especially warm relations between our countries provide the                        framework for our frank consideration of this subject8 The US respects the motivation and intentions of the Iranian Govt in the                        matter of oil pricing policy We understand various of the factors which                        have entered into Irans formulation of policy on this subject We are also                        well aware of GOIs proposals and actions                        to help alleviate financial burden on some lessdeveloped consumers through                        concessional funding We remain however deeply concerned over the                        cumulative burden of price hikes over the past year and over the latest                        indicationthrough Irans decision to implement the two percent royalty tax                        increase approved in Quitothat the burden is being increased rather than                        lightened9 We would welcome GOI comment and                        opportunity to discuss these matters in greater detail in spirit of close                        friendship which marks our relations10 Ambassador Helms has been                        informed of above and he will draw upon this telegram as appropriate in his                        conversations with GOI after his return to                        TehranKissinger	19740715

                       characterization of him as a tool of American imperialism The King                            wondered why the United States did not put pressure on Iran and publicly                            support Saudi efforts to reduce oil prices National Archives RG 59 Central Foreign Policy Files                            D74018810671 During audience with Shah on July 23 I made points contained Ref A These                        were tied to upcoming visit Exxon Chairman Jamieson and BP Deputy                        Chairman Steel2 Shahs response while showing understanding of world economic problems                        was a forceful reiteration of the points he has made over recent months                        beginning with his December 23 1973 press conference in which the last                        major oil price increase was announcedSee footnote 2 Document 49 The Shahs December                            23 1973 press conference was reported in telegram

that oil companies were clearing only 60 or 70 cents a barrel the Shah said                        that two years ago they would have been delighted at 20 cents a barrel He                        plans take this up with Jamieson and                            Steel next week In addition he                        is still irritated over exorbitant taxes on petroleum products especially in                        Western Europe4 In more reflective comments he acknowledged that price of oil should be                        negotiable At the same time he insisted it must be pegged to something                        Shah believes only rational guidepost to be cost of alternate sources of                        energy He made usual points that petroleum is a wasting nonrenewable                        asset and that there was nothing precisely like it in the natural world5 Shah said that he had no interest at this time in forcing up the price of                        oil as long as Iran is able to maintain its purchasing power From his                        point of view this means that industrialized countries must do something                        about inflation6 In his December 23 press conference the Shah had suggested that                        representatives of OECD sit down with the                            OPEC members to discuss the real value                        of oil He emphasized that his suggestion was a very serious one and that I still mean it Nothing                        has come of it he pointed out Instead the United States decided to get                        the OECD members together for a series of                        discussions with the aim of eventual negotiations with producers After                        almost seven months no one has come forward to talk reasonably either with                        him or any of the other OPEC members The                        Shah hoped it was not already too late for meaningful talks to take                        place7 The Shah firmly reiterated his view that producers and consumers should                        sit down very soon to discuss the problems of both sides including                        especially the inflation problem He said Ill be reasonable as long as                        there is a real attempt to meet the needs of the producing countries8 In response to remarks about the need to recycle petro dollars the Shah                        asserted that Iran is doing the best it can in providing roughly one billion                        dollars each for India Egypt and France in addition to 12 billion for                            UK 750 million for Pakistan and                        smaller amounts for Syria Senegal and others He is prepared to do                        more9 Concerning the effects of the KuwaitGulf and BP agreement possible effects of the AramcoSaudi Arabia                        negotiation and the increase in royalty percentage by two percent he                        recognized that the effects of these would redound to Irans benefit in the                        form of an increased balancing margin but he added I did not do these                        things10 The conclusions that one can draw from the Shahs response are                        several:A He has no rpt no intention of taking any                        steps which would lead to a reduction in oil prices in advance of a                        consumerproducer dialogueB Iran shares our concern over the international economic consequences of                        oil price increases and within the possibilities available to it and                        without doing damage to Irans own plans and programs is prepared to                        cooperate in measures to alleviate themC Producer governments problems must be seriously and completely dealt                        with Comment: These problems presumably include                        transfer of technology availability of industrial and other commodities                        inflation and concomitant question of maintenance of value of producing                        countries purchasing powerD Iran has no rpt no preference as to the                        form of producerconsumer discussions except that they should begin very                        soon perhaps initially with a small team on each sideE Concerning King Faisals strong                        suggestion that the US put pressure on Iran Ref B unless the form of                        pressure is clearly defined and the full weight not only of the United                        States but other consumer governments is behind it we see no rpt no chance of any beneficial effects We feel other avenues including                        producerconsumer talks should be exhausted before attempting to apply such                        pressure11 The tone of the audience during discussion on oil prices was friendly but                        firm I would not wish to leave any doubt about the Shahs dedication to the                        proposition that oil prices must remain at least at their present level His                        personal prestige and that of the Government of Iran are firmly engaged                        Unless we are prepared to make clear our intention to forego close US                        relations with Iran in order to bring oil prices down without Irans                        cooperation we see no rpt no alternative                        but to

frus1969-76v27d69	69 Telegram From the Embassy in Iran to the Department of State	None	1974-07-25 06:35:00	None	None	6159 For Secretary from Ambassador Subject: Audience with Shah Ref: A                        Tehran 6106 B State 152797 C Tehran 6142In                            telegram 6106 from Tehran July 23 Helms informed Kissinger that the Shah was obviously pleased that                                Kissinger would be the US                            cochairman of the Commission on Cooperation with Iran Ibid RG 59 Central Foreign Policy Files                            P8500172021 Telegram 152797 is Document 66                            Telegram 6142 is Document 681 During audience on July 23 Shah said to me at two different points: Dr                            Kissinger is really a wizard and                        has done such remarkable things about settling wars after they have been                        fought why is it that he cannot be equally clever before these events occur                        and prevent them from happening After making this comment for the second                        time I asked the Shah if he really wanted me to report this comment to you                        With a broad grin on his face he said Yes I certainly do I am not sure                        what triggered this genuine compliment but it may have been a headline that                        morning in one of local Englishlanguage newspapers which read Kissinger does it again2 Although pleased that you will be coming to Iran later on the Shah                        appears to be somewhat restive and in a bit of a quandary over his relationships with the United                        States It is not that anything has gone wrong officially He recognizes                        that the President and you are strong friends and that his many requests in                        the civilian and military field are being handled about as promptly and                        sympathetically as is reasonable to expect It is rather that items like the                        static from the United States over crude oil prices as manifested in                        Secretary Simons comments The New York Times editorial criticizing Irans                        purchase of 25 percent of KruppThe July 20  New York Times editorial described the Iranian                            investment of petrodollars in Krupp as a sign of the dangerous shift of                            power to the Middle East p 30 the dragging on of the whole                        Watergate affair seem to be causing uneasiness3 Secretary Simons frequent                        utterances to the press about Iran and crude oil prices are causing the                            USG nothing but problems with the Shah                        and the Government of Iran Whether Simon is right or wrong from the standpoint of the United                        States is not the question The Iranians think he is wrongheaded as well as                        rude I will not bore you with how I handled the nut statement with the                        Shah but I did Incidentally Nick Thimmesch of Newsday who has crossed paths with Secretary Simon in this Gulf area indicates that                            Simon is hard on Israel and is                        going to push for prompt pressure on the Israelis to make territorial                        concessions to the Arabs4 I squared off on the concern about New York Times                        editorial policy by pointing out that I had personally heard Presidents                            Kennedy Johnson and Nixon inveigh against these editorial                        attitudes on many occasions I also pointed out that even the Israeli                        Government has got furious from time to time that the only suggestion I had                        was to stop reading the newspaper as President Eisenhower had done To this                        the Shah replied My Foreign Office keeps sending me telegrams about these                        things I cannot avoid reading them5 We had quite a discussion about crude oil prices I pointed out that                        regardless of what one thought of the price hike on December 23 last prices                        were still inching up as a result of the 2 percent royalty increase at                        Quito Gulfs acceptance of the buyback prices dictated by the Kuwait                        Government and the likely outcome of Saudi Arabias negotiations with                        Aramco I weighed in about the balance of payments problem in the countries                        of Western Europe discussed the effect on the international monetary system                        and the financial disequilibrium which was being caused in the world The                        Shah listened and then quietly began to talk He pointed out that he was not                        going to be cheated on the price of his oil that its proper price should be                        keyed to the cost of alternative sources of energy that it was a wasting                        commodity which would be finished within a predictable period of time and                        that the derivatives from oil in terms of petrochemicals would bring returns                        at least eight times as great as                        the sale of the crude oil itself He insisted that he does not want to see                        the price go so high that it ruins the economies of industrialized countries                        and that he is fully prepared to be reasonable about these matters He said                        flatly that if Iran could keep its current purchasing power he did not want                        to see the price of crude oil augmented any further He insisted on the                        other hand that if inflation were to continue rampant in the West he had                        no choice but to protect himself and his country He then turned to the                        handling of the crude oil price problem by the United States Government He                        said that in his December 23 press conference he had proposed a dialogue                        between the OECD nations and the countries                        in OPEC He said he realized that all                        members could hardly hold a constructive dialogue with each other but that                        it should be possible to have conversations involving a small number on each                        side He went on to say that the USG                        started off on the wrong foot in that it has spent its time organizing the                        industrialized countries but has done nothing to open conversations with the                        oil producers It came through loud and clear that until the industrialized                        countries are prepared to communicate with the oil producers about the                        latters problems and grievances nothing is going to be done about the                        current trends in oil prices at least as far as the Shah is concerned He                        is looking forward to talking on Monday with Jamieson of Exxon and Steel of BP about the                        profits of major oil companies and their future roleJamieson briefed                            the Embassy on his and Steels

D7402060884 He will want to talk to you                        when you visit here about this whole problem after which he hopes that he                        will be clearer in his mind as to what he feels should be done His                        presentation was remarkably consistent with the text of his December 23                        press conference which you may want to review at some

  poppy production in six provinces and part of Konya He said he would be                            explaining details to Parliament afternoon July 2nd He added that he                            was going to ask the United Nations to give advice and technical                            assistance and that all the control measures advised would be taken                            and that the Turkish nation will act with full consciousness of its                            responsibility to the world3 I said that I must ask on behalf of my government that he reconsider                            this decision It carried the gravest risks of setting back our battle                            against heroin and of doing enormous damage to the USTurkish security                            relationship I then emphasized that as result of tonights announcement                            we were already in crisis relationship and that his governments                            proposed action would in my judgement bring the USTurkish                            relationship to its lowest point since World War II I also said that                            while I hoped very much I was wrong the odds tonight were very strong                            that US military assistance to Turkey was finished The US Executive                            branch while deeply dismayed would not I thought initiate such a cut                            off The Congress however would take decision into its own hands4 Isik supported by Prime                            Minister said that reconsideration was politically out of question It                            would result in no government and no relationship with US Ecevit added that he would have thought                            TurkAmerican relations ran deeper than I had suggested I expressed                            equal surprise that GOT would take such                            an action against a friend and moreover that we should learn of it                            through a public broadcast I then let it be known that active                            consideration was being given in Washington to

                       Congress likely have little faith in effectiveness of any proposed                            controls Ecevit said again that                            irrevocable government decision taken that poppies would be grown but                            he would welcome all advice on controls and asked what I would                            suggest6 I reiterated that even smallest amount of poppy growing likely to have                            most serious consequences in USTurk relationship Obviously however                            if he were prepared to grow only a very small amount at start surround                            it with massive surveillance and expand only after soundness of                            controls had been proven to satisfaction of international communitythis                            might possibly make Congressional problem slightly more manageable I                            added that if the poppy growing area at start was so minute as to                            obviously present almost no danger of significant diversion into illicit                            channels I personally would urge USG to                            continue subsidy for the much larger proportion of those former poppy                            farmers not being permitted to resume cultivation I said that by                            growing even a small amount he would have made good on his election                            pledge At same time severe limitation of the kind I was suggesting                            might make problem somewhat more manageable at our end I then added                            that if GOT absolutely determined to                            resume cultivation an even better alternative would be to wait the                            three years necessary to develop a brachtiatum program and maintain the                            ban until then7 Ecevit responded that my                            suggestions especially the first one merited serious consideration and                            he would take them to his government in the morning He added that in                            both his explanation to Parliament and in a major television appearance                            on Eurovision evening July 2nd he would seek to reassure Congress by                            emphasizing his governments intention to limit and control production                            I said I appreciated effort but doubtful of its success8 At conclusion of conversation Isik supported by Prime Minister expressed hope that                            official USG spokesman while regretting                                GOT decision would add expression                            of confidence that a proven ally would act responsibly re surveillance                            effort I said latter would not be possible9 Comment: Decision comes as bitter                            disappointment especially as we convinced that in past few weeks for                            first time US position was gaining adherents within Turkish

of coup Whether Ioannides                            has in fact unlocked Pandoras box or provided principally for the                            replacement of Makarios with                            some far more pliable Greek remains to be seen2 However the brutality of the operation as well as the skillful manner                            in which it was pursued indicate once again how dangerous and unreliable                            General Ioannides can really                            bea concern which my reporting and analysis of the November 25 coup                            clearly reflectedSee Document 83 Makarios apparently misjudged                                Ioannides believing his                            confrontation with Turkey would make him more amenable to elimination of                            the Greek National Guard officers as a major power element on the                            island Instead in the Ioannides posture there is evidence the Greek military                            considered the Greek military presence in Cyprus important in their own                            overall military posture visvis Turkey because it kept important                            Turkish forces in southern Turkey and away from Aegean and Evros areas                                Makarios meanwhile sought                            continued and perhaps strengthened support of Eastern Europe Russia Peking and probably                            other Third World elements4 Ioannides and his cohorts it                            must be remembered are fanatically antiCommunist With them whose                            leaders participated in the sacred war against Communism in Greece in                            the 1940s only Christianity perhaps the obverse to them of Communism                            ranks in national values with it Makarios in his misjudgment committed in eyes of Greek                            military regime the unpardonable sin of not only rejecting and repelling                            the Motherland but adding insult to injury by publication of the                                Makarios letter to GhizikisMakarios wrote Ghizikis on July 2 as reported in                                telegrams 1276 and 1303 from Nicosia July 5 and July 9

completed contingency plans to remove him Dept will recall that                            earlier Ioannides stated flatly                            he could get rid of Makarios                            within 24 hours whenever he wished Frankly this proves once again how                            dangerously narrow a view Ioannides holds see Athens 8294 November 27                            1973Greeces apparent master: Demetrios Ioannides: some fearsNot                                printed Ibid but even more alarming his willingness to                            resort to violence and perhaps even murder This bodes darkly indeed for                            a peaceful solution to the Aegean problem between Turkey and Greece A                            negative substantive reaction on our part will likely lead to negative                            substantive reaction from them6 A further question in present context of the problem is the effect                            upon the internal stability of the regime Certainly the people of                            Greece will not be happy with the violent extermination of Makarios and loss of liberty of the                            island In fact the real opposition to these military adventures to                            call them what they are is likely to deepen greatly On the other hand                                Ioannides remains                            effectively in control of the armed forces at this point His stress on                            clearing out anarchic elements on the island will not weaken his                            present hold Greek military are even likely to feel that clearing out                            the Communist elements on the island against prospect of an imminent                            confrontation with Turkey may make a lot of military sense Thus the                            immediate effect upon Greek regimes stability does not appear visibly                            negative7 Of course if the context should change in a fashion clearly                            demonstrating ineptness on the part of Ioannides and his adherents as sacred custodians of                            Greek national interest this could affect reaction While fight on                            Communism internal and external and the confrontation with Turkey will                            not impair Ioannides strength                            serious difficulties with the US and its NATO allies could create problems for his continued

152379Document 82 For the Secretary1 I used secure reliable channel directly to General Ioannides to deliver message reftel                            He began by explaining he had personal message from USG After emissary had read two                            paragraphs Ioannides commented                            message must be same as that Ambassador had given Kypreos in which case                            emissary wasting his time since he would receive message anyway                            Emissary explained his job was to finish reading message and hand it to                            him and would do so to which General Ioannides said fine2 After emissary completed message the General literally blew up                            jumped up backed up knocked over a table broke empty glass and                            uttered a strong obscenity He continued that one day Kissinger makes public statements                            regarding noninterference in Greek internal affairs and a few weeks                            later the USG says consistent with the                            above principles  and threatens interference No matter what happened                            in Cyprus I Ioannides will be                            blamed If I had pulled the troops out the former politicians would have                            blamed me for turning the island over to the Communists Some day USG will realize that on 15 July 1974                            Cyprus was saved from falling into the hands of the Communists3 General then calmed down came over to where emissary was sitting and                            said he knew he understood him: diplomatic talk is timeconsuming but he                            would answer in as diplomatic fashion as possible because he had                            diplomatic mission4 General stated that Greece also believed in noninterference and in a                            free independent sovereign state of Cyprus Greece would abide by the                            decision of the majority of the Greek Cypriots most of whom were                            nationalists and these nationalists were the ones who had moved against                                Makarios It was immaterial                            whether these Greek Cypriot nationalists moved with or without the prior                            blessing of Greece or whether Greek officers subsequently assisted them                            At this point he went off on a tangent stating that neither Greece nor                            the Greek Cypriots had asked for enosis that GOT had obviously accepted these developments in Cyprus                            that Turks understood that the matter was an internal Greek Cypriot                            affair5 According to Ioannides only                            real resistance left on Cyprus were Communist supporters of Makarios in Paphos these supporters                            were even singing EAMELASReference is to                                the Greek Communist resistance movement of World War II                            songs Most of the rest of island was in nationalist hands General                                Ioannides stated that                            everyone should forget that Makarios was an international figure that he was a                            national hero that he had served several useful functions and that he                            was a man of the cloth Makarios                            had become a rotten priest homosexual he was perverted a torturer a                            sexual deviate and the owner of half the hotels on the island To preserve his position                            and to continue his activities Makarios was willing to sacrifice seventy per cent of                            the Greek Cypriot population only thirty per cent were AKEL and entire antiCommunist Turkish                            Cypriot population Ioannides                            asserted Greek Cypriots in National Guard realized these facts and had                            begged motherland for chance to act against Makarios General claimed that he only assisted after                            being presented with a fait accompli6 At this point emissary interjected and told Ioannides pointblank that with coup                            only twentyfour hours after his reporting to us regarding a possible                            overthrow of Makarios this was very difficult for anyone to believe At                            this point the General again blew up with arms waving knocked over the                            same table broke a second glass and between obscenities stated that                            he did not plot and arrange the coup initial plan and approach was from                            Greek Cypriot nationalists on 13 July after latter learned that GOG intended to accede to Makarios demands to reduce number of                            Greek officers in National Guard General stated he could not accept at                            least 85000 Greek Cypriot refugees from Makarios  tyranny This coupled with Makarios antiregime efforts made                            him decide to assist Greek Cypriot nationalists The General stated that                            if Makarios succeeded in kicking Greeks out of Cyprus what could keep                            him from thinking he could not kick junta out of Greece After deciding                            to assist Greek Cypriots the General claimed that he did not tell the                            Armed Forces leadership nor any Greek official He limited knowledge of                            his intentions to few select officers on 1314 July no one else knew                            and even after events unfolded on 15 July only a handful of people were                            aware of his role Ioannides                            justified this action by asserting that if he had briefed numerous                            people they would have raised suggestions advice alternatives and                            possible problems He added that he acted on spur of the moment7 Ioannides declared that game                            was now over for Makarios that                            Greek Cypriots had booted him out that National Guard and Greek                            officers had assisted nationalist Greek Cypriot brothers and that only                            resistance now was in Paphos In reply to emissarys direct question                                Ioannides stated that                                Makarios was still alive                            but who cares he now has no power and no one if he believes in                            principle of noninterference in internal affairs of sovereign nation                            will assist himnot even the Russians unless Turks ask them to do so and                            the Turks just dont care8 In reply to question whether Greeks were in direct touch with Turks                            General stated we have not bothered the Turks we have not declared                            enosis Turks agree that the principal thorn ie Makarios is gone and I am not in                            touch with the Turks He expressed view that Greece and Turkey could                            now proceed at some future time to sit down talk and solve their                            differences Indeed according to Ioannides Greeks might even be willing to share profits of petroleum finds in a joint                            exploration company however Greece would never surrender Aegean                            continental shelf because this would mean Turkish control of Greek                            islands He also expressed belief that Greek and Turkish Cypriots could                            probably solve their difficulties peacefully quietly and amicably He                            even joked that in a year or perhaps more realistically ten the Turks                            might want to sell their share of Cyprus for increased percentage of                            petroleum rights Again in reply to direct question General Ioannides stated that he was not in                            contact with any Turkish official however he added that Turks were                            officially aware that enosis was not the objective at this point and                            that Greek Cypriots did not intend any bloody action against Turk                            Cypriots9 When asked for specifics on Makarios Ioannides stated that according to Greek information                                Makarios was alive and in                            hands of British at Episkopi Base he had gone there with assistance of                            Canadians and British on island10 At this point Ioannides                            summed up as follows:A He stressed that he too had a God he was definitely not                            antiAmerican even a jackass needed a post to be tied to and in his                            case it was the USB His hasty decision on 13 July might have been stupid Instead of                            abandoning Cyprus and letting US worry about its fate and pour money                            down another rathole he had allowed love of country a moral obligation                            to the Greek Cypriot nationalists and his philotimo to overrule logic                            and to assist Greek CypriotsC Greece would do whatever was necessary to preserve its national                            identity and to stay antiCommunist If this meant keeping Yiaros open                            it would stay open as long as it was necessary and he would accept no                            static from anyone on this score Indeed he had instructed a Greek                            official to tell British officially that whenever the British let Irish                            political prisoners out of British jails he would free the fortytwo                            Greek political prisoners on YiarosD He personally didnt like Nikos                                Sampson but that was Greek Cypriot nationalist decision                            He knew Sampson personally and in his opinion Sampson was crazy He                            jokingly remarked that new Cypriot Minister of Defense Dimitriou was very proAmerican and                            that our Embassy there would soon realize this He also knew Dimitriou                            personallyE While shaking hands at close of conversation Ioannides stated Remember we too                            believe in a free independent and sovereign Cyprus we too believe in                            noninterference along with Turks and especially with Kissinger We too believe that the                            Cypriots should be free to solve their own problems be they Greek                            Cypriots Turk Cypriots or bothTasca	19740716

antiCommunist Movement of                            National Salvation also undoubtedly part of same scenario Failure to                            kill Makarios clearly                            complicates the consolidation of a new regime by Sampson backers2 With Makarios now in a                            position of personal safety combined with British Foreign Office                            announcement it continues to recognize Makarios government position of                            the rebels could become precarious This is particularly likely if                            resistance on the island should continue It seems difficult to believe                            that with the expertise of the Greek Cypriot Communist Party one of                            the best organized Communist parties anywhere a very strong                            Communistdominated trade union and an active Socialist party under                            strongly leftist Lysarrides who had developed some sort of                            paramilitary forces of his own armed resistance to Greek led Cypriot                            National Guard will not continue In circumstances one could expect                            the USSR to seek to rush military                            supplies to those resisting although island probably already possesses                            large supplies of arms clandestinely cached USSR would then simply be responding to request of                            legitimate head of an independent government and UN member3 If fighting should continue it seems likely GOT would feel under increased pressure to augment its                            forces in Cyprus They are legitimate under terms of LondonZurich                            agreements as one of three guarantor powers In the event Turk Cypriots                            killed injured or seriously threatened pressure upon Turkey to act                            likely to be even greater4 In latter event hard to believe Ioannides would not feel he must augment Greek forces                            Incidentally if fighting is protracted or threatens to become so                            Ioannides may try to augment Greek forces in any feasible way eg                            even clandestine infiltration since the longer and more independent the resistance the                            more disastrous the entire operation could become for Ioannides5 Embassy believes there is reason to lay this operation at the door of                                KYP Greek central intelligence                            organization A clear failure by Ioannides given Greek tendency to abandon leaders who                            fail could seriously undermine Ioannides junta Ioannides is likely to feel under                            pressure and our contact with him today indicates his actions may                            reflect this nervous condition so that he may move to ensure                            establishment of Sampson regime as soon as possible Unless he succeeds                            he could well fall into great trouble with other members of military                            hierarchy particularly since Ioannides now claims he did not keep them                            informed assertion for which there is some supporting evidence6 A final word about Sampson a                            review of our biographic data and knowledge about this man confirms the                            impression we have had of him hitherto His is an out and out gangster                            a gorillatype with no compunctions against murder and assassination He                            may well be considered as potentially a pliable tool for Ioannides but it seems more likely he                            would be a marked liability in most respects7 The GOT may feel that in the final                            analysis it is better off dealing with a direct agent of Athens rather                            than both Athens and Makarios                            This was Papadopoulos line and GOT                            recalling this may feel a deal between the two military to settle                            Cyprus issue along with others between Greece and Turkey may now be                            easier to realize This is particularly true in light of strong public                            assurances GOG and Sampson group are putting out                            proclaiming their firm adherence to the principle of a united sovereign                            and independent Cyprus as well as their continued support for                            intercommunal talks to establish stabilized and viable relations between                            the two groups on the island8 At same time it should have been clear to Turkish Government from                            initial stages of AthensNicosia quarrel that tolerance of Greek regime                            leaders had definite limits Uncharacteristically relaxed attitude on                            Turkish side supports speculation that GreekTurkish communication in                            private channel probably military may have provided reassurance                            essential to avoid escalating Turkish reaction If true Turkish                            military leaders with firsthand knowledge of intentions of Greek                            counterparts

           82 PriMin responded as fols:1 Current GOT assessment of                            situation:A Coup appears to have succeeded While there are still undoubtedly                                Makarios resources on                            island they probably are lying low now so as to avoid risk of exposure                            and destruction at this timeB Coup completely engineered by Greek GovtC GOT does not fear de jure enosis move                            in immediate future On contrary Turks believe that Athens will                            maintain fiction of separateness as this will enable GOG in effect to have two votes in UN while it has one foot in NATO camp and another in nonaligned                            worldD GOT does not accept this as an                            internal Cypriot problem On contrary it is international matter                            involving violation of an agreement to which Turkey is a party and                            guarantorE Deterioration of position of Turks on island is inevitable if new                            regime stays in powerF Vulnerability of Turks on island greatly increased by lack of their                            having secure access to sea coastG Current situation therefore completely unacceptable to the GOT If acceptable situation not recreated                            Turkey will have to directly intervene with military force on                            islandH If intervention necessary it will be bloodier the longer it is put                            off Therefore GOT not prepared to                            delay intervention beyond few daysI Situation has brought to head growing GOT conviction that Greek Turks cooperation within NATO must be terminated see septelNot foundJ GOT seeking to work closely with                            British as a jointguarantor on this situation Shortly after his                            advising me that they were seeking high level meeting with British                            message was handed to PriMin saying UKG had agreed to such meeting right                            away in London PriMin read me message and indicated that he and                                Isik would be leaving                            immediately for UK He will arrive there                            tonight He expected visit to last for day or soK With respect to Soviet attitude PriMin said Russians were restless                            over situation and not keeping this a secret He saw considerable                            significance in official TASS statement that Cyprus developments                            endangered dtente SovAmb had repeated this statement in                            meeting with Pres Koruturk last night I said that we had heard of                            Soviet offer to put troops on island and that was one thing situation                            definitely did not need2 GOT objectives:A PriMin said that GOT basic objective                            is restitution of Cyprus constitutional govt By this he meant return                            of Makarios to his head of govt                            position or if this not feasible that Makarios successor should emerge through previously                            established constitutional proceduresB That Greek officers of Cyprus National Guard must leave the                            islandC That a secure corridor to the sea must be obtained for Turkish                            community3 I asked PriMin if he and British should reach agreement on above                            objectives during London meetings how he expected them to be brought                            about PriMin said We will see They have bases there If they do not                            use them now what are they for We will see what the British think We                            will explore all peaceful solutions before considering others4 At end of conversation PriMin summarized situation as follows:A New regime on Cyprus completely unacceptable to GOT GOT                            hopes status quo ante can be restored without Turkish military                            intervention If this is not done GOT                            prepared carry out military intervention It believes latter would be                            better done within a few days rather than waiting weeks or monthsB If new regime retains control of island GOT might be willing hold off military intervention if a                            corridor to the sea guaranteed to Turkish residents of island This                            combined with clear Turkish military superiority in area would give                                GOT assurance that it could rescue                            Turkish population if that were needed5 PriMin wishes to stay in close touch with USG and would be very grateful to have Secretary Kissingers comments on foregoing He                            expressed hope that these could be conveyed to him while he was still in

frus1969-76v30d97	97 Telegram From the Department of State to Certain Posts	None	1974-07-18 23:54:00	None	None	156312 Subject: Policy Considerations in Cyprus Situation1 Our principal objectives at this time are A to prevent a Turkish                            decision to intervene militarily and B to avoid the development of                            positions by other countries which might contribute to the outbreak of                            civil war in Cyprus In either event the Soviets would exploit the                            situation to their advantage thus enhancing their position in the                            Eastern Mediterranean and strengthening the Communists in Cyprus2 We must therefore seek to slow down actions either by individual                            countries or within the UN which might                            tend to precipitate either of the above two events and endeavor to gain                            time to develop a situation where a negotiated settlement on Cyprus can                            be achieved The ideal solution would be to obtain a negotiated                            agreement between the UK Turkey and                            Greece as the guarantor powers3 The situation is that while Makarios remains the de jure President of Cyprus a de                            facto regime exists on the island and it has established full control                            It seems unlikely that Makarios                            can reestablish himself without outside support If the UN is permitted to adopt a resolution which                            legitimizes Makarios position                            and calls for his return on the possible pain of sanctions then in the                            wake of certain refusal of the Western powers to undertake this mission                            the Soviets would undoubtedly endeavor to fill the void with all its                            implications Makarios return                            to Cyprus under these conditions would only enhance the Soviet position                            in the Mediterranean and that of the Communists in Cyprus4 While the Turkish Government is presently supporting the return of                                Makarios its demands to                            improve its strategic position on the island would not be viable since                            if Makarios should return under                            these conditions he would be unwilling to appear as a Turkish satellite                            and would look to outside support in all probability the Communists to                            counterbalance the Turkish position We must therefore urge the Turks                            to take a longrange view of the situation and recognize that their                            present posture could be seriously detrimental to their interests5 We also believe that the UK in                            considering its present course must face up to the probability that                                Makarios cannot be restored                            by political means and must                            recognize the fact that it does not have the means to accomplish this in                            any other form6 With respect to Greece it is quite clear that the return of Makarios would be totally unacceptable                            since the whole objective of the regime has been the removal of                                Makarios Moreover                                Makarios return could only                            be accomplished through the removal of the Sampson regime and the withdrawal of the Greek officers                            of the National Guard If Makarios were restored under these conditions the                            influence of Athens in Cyprus would be reduced and the consequent                            weakening of the balance of force would tend to make Makarios place greater reliance on the                            Communists and on the Eastern bloc7 The Sampson regime is clearly                            unacceptable to the Turks and to a good part of the international                            community The US also cannot accept the Sampson regime However it is now in place and we                            believe it would be unwise to seek the removal of Sampson until a substitute solution is                            in sight With regard to the Greek officers of the National Guard we                            believe that it would be a mistake to take any position on that matter                            for the reason outlined in para 6 above and pending the development of a                            negotiated solution However we are not committed to the continuing                            presence of Greek officers in the National Guard8 It is important that our friends and allies understand that any course                            of action relating to Cyprus which results in the overthrow of the Greek                            regime opens up the Eastern Mediterranean to Soviet meddling and                            exploitation and invites active Turkish intervention would initiate a                            course of events which would be unpredictable difficult if not                            impossible to control and which would have seriously damaging effects                            on Western interests9 The thrust of our position at this time therefore is to avoid                            assuming a public posture which commits us to any particular course of                            action We view as unlikely the restoration of Makarios and we do not accept a                                Sampson regime Consequently                            the situation in favor of either one or the other should not be allowed                            to freeze thus creating the conditions for the development of a                            compromise and negotiated settlement which would permit the maintenance                            of constitutional arrangements in Cyprus both in their internal and                            external aspects10 For Ambassadors or Chargs: Above should be                            used only in your discussions with highest level of government to which                            accredited11 For Ambassador Rumsfeld: You may use above in

NAC discussions and other reports of Nine views indicate that we confront an uphill effort to reach Allied agreement on minimum satisfactory CSCE resultsIn telegram 4464 from Geneva July 13 Sherer sent operative language on key Basket III issues and strongly urged the Department to reconsider its intention to try to reach agreed texts on these points at NATO He believed that there would be considerable resistance to such an initiative but that such resistance would be substantially less if the drafting of texts was left to the NATO caucus in Geneva Sherer stated: Our allies fear that if we set out our minimum essential requirements in specific drafts we will be forced to negotiate for less For this reason they would prefer objectives to be listed in outline form as in the EC9 paper on this subject Geneva 4443 with flexibility left to negotiators in Geneva to adapt texts as necessary If we advance in NATO drafts which are clearly aimed toward compromise allied fears will be reinforced and their resistance to this project may well be strengthened It is only after confronting rigid Soviet resistance that our allies will be willing to accept compromise texts Ibid Telegram 4443 from Geneva July 12 is ibid Nonetheless we wish to pursue this exercise for we believe that only through intraAllied debate on the issues at play can we begin to bring the Allies to consider the choices they will need to make especially with regard to Basket 3 and CBMs Thus you should take a strong lead in the work of the NATO caucus in Geneva pressing for the development of the text of a study which clearly identifies the issues in Basket 3 and that fleshes out in reasonable detail principal Allied objectives in these areas2 For the purposes of this exercise we are prepared generally to accept the Nine paperSee footnote 2 Document 236 as it relates to Baskets 1 and 2 though we may have editorial changes to suggest The portion of Basket 1 on CBMs can be left to be worked out in NATO For USNATO: we assume SPC will develop contribution on CBMs and you should base your approach on previous guidance including Madrid 4339See footnote 3 Document 2363 With regard to Basket 3 your objective should be to stimulate a discussion of each of the texts including anticipated Eastern attitudes toward each Based on the discussion the operative elements of each text should be set out succinctly so that in the ensuing NAC review PermReps will be in a position also to discuss them Where there are differences in Allied views bracketed texts should be included together with an indication of respective national positions as a further aid to NAC review Finally you should strive to elicit a rough order of priority among the texts looking toward a narrowing of the number to say six to eight While we may not be able to get agreement at this stage to paring the number down prioritization now would help with this later in NAC discussion4 As a contribution to this exercise we will provide you with suggested drafts on selected issues drawing on the helpful suggestions in Geneva 4464See footnote 2 above The first of these texts on working conditions for journalists is provided below Others will follow by septels on broadcast information travel access to literary worksSee footnotes 68 Document 236 As you will note we have moderated some of the texts to render them more realistic in terms of negotiability with the Soviets5 Consistent with the approach outlined above our drafts too will cover what we regard as the key operative passages6 We do not intend to provide a text on the family reunification issue because of its sensitivity for the FRG We also note that an Allied paper on this issue has been largely agreed in the NATO caucus and has been discussed with the Soviets On the marriage issue we can support the Norwegian paper as a succinct statement of Allied desiderata Nor do we plan at this time to provide you with texts on secondary and probably noncontroversial issues of cultural exchanges and cultural contacts7 There follows the text covering working conditions for journalists:Begin text That visas and residence permits for journalists and their technical staffs be granted as expeditiously as possible That steps be taken to grant journalists greater freedom of travel within participating states in pursuit of their professional activities and that the necessary travel permits be granted within a reasonable period of timeThat journalists not be subject to expulsion for normal professional activitiesThat steps will be taken to facilitate journalists contacts in pursuit of their professional activities with officials of the participating states as well as with private individualsThat journalists be allowed to carry with them equipment and materials necessary for the exercise of their professionThat journalists be allowed to transmit fully and without delay the materials which are the results of their professional activity End textIngersoll	19740719
