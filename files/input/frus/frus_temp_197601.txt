following letter from President Ford to Prime Minister Rabin as soon as possible2 Begin text:Dear Mr Prime Minister:I appreciate receiving your letter of December 16 1975In the letter Rabin expressed his concerns about the forthcoming                            Security Council debate Ibid In view of the importance of the                            UN Security Council deliberations                        beginning January 12 I believe it is essential for me to have a further                        exchange with you regarding US policy and strategy I am sharing some                        tentative views now so that you and your colleagues can reflect upon them                        before and in connection with Foreign Minister Allons meetings with Secretary Kissinger We do not wish the very difficult Security                        Council proceedings in January to become a source of misunderstanding                        between us As you yourself have often said Mr Prime Minister there is                        much that is common and parallel in Israeli and US policies but they have                        never been and cannot be identicalWe have studied your December 16 letter with great care and understanding                        Israel need have no concern regarding an imposed solution   A settlement must come as a result of negotiations between the                        principal parties concerned We are also keenly aware that Syria is seeking                        to make the Security Council the primary and more or less permanent                        instrument of diplomacy Here too you should be assured that we would view                        such a development as contrary to our mutual interests We continue to                        believe strongly and firmly that the Geneva Conference framework is best                        suited for future diplomacyHaving said this Mr Prime Minister I know you fully realize that we face a                        most difficult and delicate situation in the Security Council Your                        nonparticipation will make more difficult an outcome satisfactory to you                        but this is a judgment for Israel to makeOur principal concerns are that the Council proceedings not deepen the                        stalemate so it becomes unbreakable that they not destroy the role of the US in the diplomacy of                        the Middle East and therefore dim if not extinguish the prospects for                        progress in the Middle East and bring that area closer to a renewal of                        hostilitiesIn this connection I want to make clear so as to avoid any future                        misunderstanding that the Israeli position regarding Resolutions 242 and                        338 as described in your letter in which you say we can tolerate no                        modification whatsoever in the wording or interpretation of those                        resolutions    does not accord with our view We have previously made                        clear to you that we will oppose and if necessary vote against any                        initiative in the Security Council to alter adversely the terms of reference                        of the Geneva Peace Conference or to change Resolutions 242 and 338 in any                        way which is incompatible with their original purpose I do not cite this to                        raise semantical points I merely want to say that whether 242 or 338 is                        considered to be undermined or altered adversely or changes are considered                        incompatible with their original purpose will require a judgment on a                        specific texta judgment that we feel has to take into account as well the                        considerations and concerns I have outlined in the previous paragraphs of                        this letterOur ability to get support of others for a satisfactory result in the                        Security Council will also be influenced by what they believe are the                        prospects for progress through exercise of various available options outside                        the Council There undoubtedly will be an overwhelming SC                        majorityparticularly in the new Security Council composition of 1976for a                        resolution which provides for PLO                        participation at a Geneva Conference We have thought of a number of                        formulations which we may face all of which in greater or lesser degree                        will seek to inject the Palestinian issue Some formulations would                        undoubtedly affect adversely 242 and 338 others may not For example what                        if the US is faced with a simple resolution reaffirming 242 and 338 and                        adding to this resolution language which the US has used in its policy                        statements to the effect that a durable and just peace has to take into                        account the legitimate interests of the Palestinian people We believe it                        important that such formulations be dealt with in such a way in the Council                        that they not destroy other future negotiating optionsThe Palestinian question is difficult for both of us Mr Prime Minister                        Even if this issue can be dealt with satisfactorily in the Council it is                        not one that can be avoided entirely outside the Council proceedings if the                        negotiating possibilities inherent in a Geneva Conference or in an informal                        preparatory talk of the kind suggested by Secretary Kissinger in his General Assembly                            speechIn his address to the General                            Assembly on September 22 Kissinger suggested convening informal international                            meetings to discuss the Middle East Excerpts of his speech were printed                            in the New York Times on September 23 New York Times September 23 1975 p 16                        are to be further pursuedI have made no final judgments Mr Prime Minister but I felt it important                        to share my deep concerns with you and to underscore that when your Foreign                        Minister comes to Washington he be prepared to speak specifically and                        concretely on the difficult issues referred to in this letterFinally Mr Prime Minister I know that you are aware that planning is                        progressing speedily and smoothly for your visit to the United States It is                        entirely appropriate Mr Prime Minister that in this bicentennial year                        Israels Prime Minister representing a free and democratic country that                        shares fully our ideas and firm dedication to independence will be the                        first head of government being received in 1976 Israel and the US have                        been together through much peril and promise I know these are difficult                        issues I am posing in this letter but I do so as a friend whose firm                        support for Israels security and survival remains undiminishedI wish you your family and all of the people of Israel a year of progress                        and tranquility as the search for peace continuesSincerely Ford End textRobinson	19760101

                 Iranian Foreign Policy Ref: Tehran 0279In                            telegram 279 from Tehran January 11 Helms reported to Kissinger that the Shah had impressed upon Von Marbod that the US Government                            was forcing a change in Irans foreign policy and that the interests of                            American capitalism were threatening Irans future The effect of                            reduced oil liftings and inflation in the price of military equipment                            he warned would leave Iran with a military force that was not viable                            National Archives RG 59 Central                            Foreign Policy Files P84008408821 In audience with another American visitor that followed on Sunday one                        reported reftel Shah covered much the                        same ground in similar mood He was not threatening but was completely                        serious Rather than summarize this last conversation prefer to extract                        certain themes which have reappeared during conversations with the Shah and                        General Toufanian during past few                        weeks Person with whom Shah spoke is man of unquestioned reliability who                        prefers not to have his name as part of the official record2 First Shah does not believe that international oil companies are treating                        him fairly during period when Irans petroleum exports are sharply reduced                        He has heard our arguments that we cannot control oil companies in a free                        enterprise system but insists that companies are increasing or maintaining                        their liftings from Saudi Arabia Telling recent visitor that Vienna OPEC meeting would have made nine per cent                        reduction in Persian Gulf oil priceSee footnote 3 Document 144 he argues                        that in any event small price differential is merely oil companies excuse                        not to take more Iranian crude He maintains that USG should protect Irans interests by using official influence                        with the companies He feels that Iran deserves this attention for its                        helpful performance during past oil embargo Confident that US will again                        turn to Iran if there is another cessation of Arab oil sales he does not                        like it taken for granted that Iran will automatically supply the US and                        Europe with oil they require Finally Shah is impatient with pace of                        negotiations for direct governmenttogovernment deal with USG He recently told me that for over a year                        this has bounced back and forth like a football to no conclusion3 Because of reduction in oil income Shah sees Irans developing role as a                        major regional power severely restricted He obviously feels that a strong                        Iran serves important strategic interests for the US and the West If GOI cannot afford Spruance ships AWACS AMST and other outward                        looking programs Iran will not be able to assert its strength in interest                        of the Western Alliance in this region Shah seems disinclined to settle for                        half measures If cuts are to be made he apparently plans to return to                        armed forces with a purely defensive role limited to Irans territory                        Important communications and air defense programs will be cut back4 As Iran reduces its own role as a regional power there will be diminished                        opportunities for strategic cooperation with US forces in this area For                        example if Spruance ships are cancelled plans to develop Chah Bahar naval                        base are likely also to be dropped5 Another theme is Shahs doubts about American staying power during a                        period of rising Soviet naval strength and political influence in this                        region He is clearly disturbed by Soviet gains in Angola while the US                        appears unable to offer an effective response He sees growth of Soviet navy                        in Indian Ocean and South Atlantic as an imperialistic development With                        Djibouti moving towards independence he looks for Somali dominance there                        and preponderant Soviet influence on Horn of Africa6 There is clear implication in these possible changes in Irans orientation                        towards its security role in this region that US will not be able to count                        on identity of policy with a reliable friend in ArabIsrael context and in                        other difficulties relating to regional states7 Reductions in Irans defense expenditures will surely extend to civilian                        sector with substantial losses both from contract cancellations and end to                        planning for new projects which might have benefited American business8 Shah views with bitter scorn corrupt practices of agents for US                        companies and ineffective USG efforts to                        deal with problem When Commander Deputy Commander and others in IIN were implicated in financial scandal with                        Italian missile producer they were arrested and will be tried Shah asks                        whether USG ever did this to senior                        Generals or Admirals who regularly move from key active duty posts to high                        positions in defense companies Contrary to DOD regulations Grumman obligated more than 24 million in                        agents fees and USG has taken no action                        against firmIn telegram 12545 from Tehran                            December 30 1975 the Embassy reported that the Iranian Government had                            requested that Grumman sign a schedule for repayment of 24 million in                            agents fees and would suspend the next payment for the F14 pending                            receipt of the schedule National Archives RG 59 Central Foreign Policy Files D7504500056 The                            Department replied in telegram 6191 to Tehran January 10 that                            suspension of F14 payments to the US Government would constitute                            breach of contract and that payments under FMS were separate from the IranianGrumman arrangements                            Ibid D7600090378 In telegram 378 from Tehran January 15 the                            Embassy noted that the dispute over agents fees was poisoning                            USIranian relations and recommended that the Departments of State and                            Defense consider whether the United States should take a more active                            role in resolving the problem Ibid D7600150001 Shah also                        suspects corrupt practices involved in 2 billion project at Chah Bahar planned for British                        and American Brown  Root                        companies One aspect of Iranian concern over payments to agents is belief                        that money returns to pockets of US corporate executives Plainly                        persistence of this problem is causing severe irritation in USGGOI                        relations and damaging opportunities for American business in Iran We shall                        prepare separate cable on this subject9 Finally Shah is disturbed with the way his business on weapons                        procurement has been handled by DOD                        Because of price increases and problem of payments to agents he has                        experienced serious loss of trust in FMS                        system Perhaps in the past GOI placed                        unrealistic expectations on protection of its interests when making                        purchases through DOD In any event there                        has been abrupt erosion of Shahs confidence in our ability to offer him                        effective collaboration in defense procurement10 Wish to emphasize that in his recent conversations Shah has not given                        appearance of a man who is bluffing or making threats in order to achieve                        some limited purposes He is as aware as we are of complexity of these                        problems and difficulties in reaching satisfactory solutions In outlining                        possible changes in foreign policy Shah is simply delineating consequences                        of reduced oil income and rising costs of defense systems In other words                        he is stating facts as he perceives them rather than attempting to bargain                        with us Am sure that you appreciate this Should point out that if visit of                        General Toufanian to DOD next week does not prove helpful Shah may                        begin to take some of the decisions on cancellation of equipment orders he                        has under review11 Have restricted distribution of this telegram for security reasons                        Please share it with the Secretary of Defense personally if you think it                            advisableA copy of this telegram is in the                            Washington National Records Center OSD                            Files: FRC 330840054 Box 5 Iran General

Hadithi1 Summary: On Jan 8 I called on FonMin Undersecretary Hadithi who is                        ranking Baath Party member in FonMin                        Call was forward step in USGGOI relations since USINT had been previously limited to Sec Gen level in FonMin Hadithi indicated that some change in US attitude                        towards Palestinians was necessary for improved USGGOI relations but GOI did not expect USG to give up its support for IsraelTelegram 29 from Baghdad January 13 reported that the                            governmentcontrolled press featured an article alleging that the US                            Government had found exclusive reliance on Israel inadequate to serve                            American interests and had shifted to reliance on certain Arab states as                            well adopting a more neutral attitude that recognized Palestinian                            rights The Interests Section noted that this considerable change from                            previous official propaganda might represent an effort to lay the                            groundwork for improved USIraqi relations National Archives RG 59 Central Foreign Policy Files                            D7500131072 He also said that some Arab states knew that they                        would have to recognize existence of state of Israel but restated GOI position that secular state in Palestine                        was proper solution He said that GOI did                        not support current settlement efforts because they would not lead to                        satisfactory Arab objectives but he did not say that Iraq would work                        actively to block these efforts Since meeting produced useful exchange of                        views I recommend that I be instructed to convey further details to GOI on USG                        policy in regard to Palestinians and on USG                        position

contacts at Foreign                        Ministry had previously been limited to Director General level Hadithi has                        geographic responsibility for all nonArab countries in FonMin and is also known and feared as                        ranking Baath Party member in Ministry Meeting was generally friendly in                        tone3 I began meeting with usual courtesies and told Hadithi that Secretary had                        personally approved my assignment to Baghdad and I looked forward to                        establishing more effective and higher level dialogue with GOI than we had had in recent years I said I                        thought it important that we have clearer understanding of each others                        positions through such exchanges Otherwise both governments would have to                        base their policy decisions on assessments of the others positions which                        were gathered from journalistic accounts and other secondary sources This                        could lead to misunderstandings and miscalculations I pointed out that when                        nations are having differences accurate communication between them becomes                        even more essential I added that the foreign policies of all nations                        constantly evolve in the light of new circumstances and it is important that                        we both have accurate understanding                        of each others positions and attitudes to incorporate into our respective                        decisionmaking processes I also mentioned that USG was pleased by the expansion of trade and commercial links                        between the United States and Iraq and said that we wished to support this                        expansion more effectively With this end in mind we hoped to add two or                        three positions to the USINT staff4 Hadithi replied that he was happy to receive me and that he agreed with                        what I had said about the importance of accurate communications He also                        said that he thought that American business and technology had much to offer                        the underdeveloped world including Iraq and that American business                        representatives would have free access to all agencies of the GOI as required to make the necessary                        commercial contacts5 Hadithi then proceeded with the inevitable lecture on American inequities                        towards the Palestinians and gave particular emphasis to the US veto of the                            UNSC resolution condemning the Israeli                        air raids on Lebanon I replied that we too strongly deplored Israeli air                        attacks and we regretted that we had felt compelled to veto the resolution                        But we could not treat the air attacks as though they had taken place in a                        vacuum and were unrelated to any previous events We thought the resolution                        should have condemned all acts of violence in the area6 Hadithi asked what other acts I was referring to and I said that we had in                        mind the acts of the Palestinian terrorists who had also killed innocent                        women and children We thought all such acts were senseless and only made a                        solution more difficult to achieve Hadithi replied that the Israelis had                        committed aggression on the Palestinians and therefore the GOI did not consider anything the Palestinians                        did in return as aggression7 Hadithi then made point that GOI had                        excellent relations with a number of states that support right of Israel to                        exist as an independent nation He mentioned France and certain Arab states                        that had accepted Resolutions 242 and 338 He said that Iraq did not insist                        that USG drop its support for existence of                        state of Israel in order to have good relations with GOI What did bother GOI was totally onesided attitude of USG on Palestinian question which had now resulted in almost                        complete isolation of USG from all other                        countries of the world on Palestinian issues as evidenced by recent UN votes He said that USG still seemed incapable of admitting that injustice had been                        done to Palestinians or that they had legitimate grievances against state of                        Israel8 I replied that the USG was very much                        aware of the need to take Palestinian interests into account in reaching a                        settlement of the ArabIsrael problem and I suggested that he take a close                        look at the Saunders statementOn November 12 1975 Deputy Assistant Secretary of                            State for Near Eastern and South Asian Affairs Harold Saunders in a statement before                            the House Special Subcommittee on Investigations on the Political Future                            of the Palestinians asserted that the legitimate interests of the                            Palestinian Arabs must be taken into account in the negotiating of an                            ArabIsraeli peace Palestinian Issue in Middle East Peace Efforts                                CISNo 76H46121 pp                            176198 a text of which I had transmitted previously to the                        Foreign Ministry I said that this statement spelled out our concern for                        Palestinian interests in more detail than had our earlier official                        statements Hadithi indicated he would look carefully at the statement9 Hadithi then mentioned that the official GOI position on Israel is that Jews and Arabs should link                        together peacefully in a single secular state but he also said that other                        Arab states knew in their heart of hearts that they would someday have to                        accept the existence of a state of Israel He said that Iraq differed from                        these states on this issue because Iraq did not believe that the current                        diplomatic efforts towards peace in the area would lead to satisfactory                        Arab objectives Comment: Although Hadithi did not                        say so explicitly implication of his remarks was that Iraq would not                        necessarily oppose efforts of other Arab states to reach settlement that                        included some recognition of the state of Israel In fact GOI has refrained from criticizing Sadat or                        the Government of Egypt for Sinai II agreement End                            comment10 I ended up conversation by repeating earlier statement that foreign                        policies of all states are in a constant state of evolution in the light of                        new circumstances and that I believed time had come for more active dialogue                        between our governments I mentioned that Secretary had hoped to see Foreign                        Minister Hammadi at UN last fall and that we were sorry meeting had                        not taken place I also said I was certain that Secretary would still like                        to meet with Foreign Minister on suitable occasion Hadithi said he would                        pass this along to Foreign Minister11 Comment: Meeting was cordial and Iraqis now appear                        willing to conduct substantive exchanges with USINT at reasonably senior levels of GOI Most interesting substantive points that emerged during                        meeting were: A Hadithis admission that some Arab states knew in their                        heart of hearts that they would have to accept the existence of the state                        of Israel and B Hadithis statement that United States would not have to                        give up its support of Israel to enjoy good relations with Iraq but only                        show more understanding of Palestinian grievances Meeting also tended to                        confirm my earlier impression that GOI                        policy is evolving away from hard line rejectionist activism and towards a                        handsoff attitude on a possible ArabIsraeli settlement although extremist                        rhetoric will no doubt continue as daily bread and butter of Baghdads                        governmentcontrolled press End comment12 I recommend that we follow up on the GOIs apparent willingness to engage USINT in substantive discussions In particular I believe we                        could probe further on question of how far GOI policy has evolved away from rejectionist activism and                        extent to which GOI has now put other                        priorities such as economic development ahead of their concern for                        Palestinian causes We might also be able to obtain some idea of their                        thinking on future security arrangements for the Gulf13 I therefore recommend that I be instructed to request an appointment with                        Hadithi or if Hadithi is not available with Wali the Director General of                        the Political Dept in the Foreign                        Ministry and make a further approach under instructions on USG policy towards the Palestinians and USG position in the current UNSC debate After making this presentation I                        could probe further on Iraqs attitude towards the rejectionist front and                        if time permits ask for Iraqs views on possible future security                        arrangements in the GulfWiley	19760113

encouraged by the leadership and unity demonstrated by moderate                            African states at the OAU summit but                            recognize they will probably be under renewed pressure from proMPLA radicals to shift their position in                            the name of OAU unity We also                            anticipate that the radicals will prefer to blame us rather than African                            states for split at the OAU thereby                            keeping door open to moderates to return to the African fold Some                            countries however particularly those recently visited by Assistant                            Secretary Schaufele may be                            singled out for abuse as American lackeys who split the OAU at Washingtons bidding2 We will need therefore to be as supportive of our African friends as                            we can in the coming crucial weeks but we will also need to do so                            discreetly in ways which will not overidentify them with us Rather                            than relying on toplevel correspondence that may leak or visits at                            least at this time by high US officials we will look to each of you to                            maintain a discreet dialogue following up on the OAU summit and developments in Angola3 It will clearly be crucial in the coming weeks that the moderate                            states continue to display the leadership and unity which they                            demonstrated at Addis To encourage them to think in these terms you                            should seek an early appointment with the highest appropriate official                            to follow up on the OAU summit and                            developments in Angola You should express your gratification at seeing the moderates of Africa                            for once so united and effective in defense of their principles and                            argue that the battle is only just starting Now it will become even                            more essential but also difficult for the moderates to act together to                            blunt proMPLA efforts to gain                            recognition You should also encourage your host leadership to go on the                            offensive using their prestige and resources to rally OAU members in support of a policy of                            conciliation4 You should encourage host government official to discuss options                            facing us all in light of OAU standoff                            and try and elicit:Any playback of impressions from the summit including who were the main

FUNDING                            REQUIRED BEYOND THE PILOT STAGE OF ALL OUR PHASED PROJECTS WOULD                            PROBABLY NECESSITATE A SHIFT FROM GRANT TO LOAN FINANCING OUR

for US assistance                        programs2 Long history of US assistance to Nepal has probably had significant                        albeit indirect effect on development of respect for basic human rights A                        feudal society only 25 years ago Nepal has made rapid progress in                        developing a political system which if autocratic cannot be described as                        authoritarian text not declassified 3 Our greatest impact in the human rights area is probably the experiences                        gained by over 2000 AID participants trained in Westernparticularly                        Americanvalue systems including the respect for basic human dignity These                        persons have risen to positions of considerable importance and leadership in                        the society and their influence has been felt all the more given the limited                        numbers of educated persons to man key positions throughout the country It                        is no exaggeration to say that it is difficult to find administrators at the                        joint secretary or above in virtually all government offices who have not                        been exposed at one time or another to American values through direct                        experience This elite constitutes a fairly important pressure group in                        assuring that basic human rights are not trampled upon even in a country                        whose monarchical powers are supreme They are for example the                        intellectual class which has successfully pressed for the release of                        political prisoners in Nepal and which has forced the government to restrict                        the application of catchalllaws used in the past to harrass political                        dissidents Through our emphasis on creating an adequate infrastructure in health and education                        we have successfully created new institutions which not only aid the                        economically and intellectually depressed rural areas of Nepal but also                        institutions which provide direct participation by relatively large segments                        of society Although it is difficult to make a definitive judgment on larger                        philosophical question cif whether economic assistance promotes human                        rights experience over 25 years in Nepal indicates slow but steady                        progress towards a political and economic system promoting and protecting                        basic rights In that period the use of cruel and inhuman punishment has all                        but disappeared: arbitrary arrest has been vastly reduced and the right of                        freedom of expression although not comparable to the United States is not                        severely restricted It is something of an anomaly that Nepal one of the                        few remaining monarchies in the world currently enjoys more fundamental                        rights than other countries in the area5 That this situation exists is in part at least the result of increasing                        confidence of the nations leadership that economic development need not be                        a threat to political stability US assistance through aiding the countrys                        economic development has likely increased Nepals political stability and                        confidence in maintaining a sovereign and independent state without the need                        to resort to immoral or inhuman methods to remain in power6 Consequently we believe our development programs have had a positive if                        largely indirect impact on human rights in Nepal However we have not in                        the past directed our programs specifically on human rights While we                        believe opportunities to carry out programs in such politically sensitive                        areas by foreign aid donors are very constrained we do believe there are                        some limited ways in which we can directly help enhance or protect those                        rights For example we would support a modest program to provide financial                        assistance to organizations such as World Peace Through Law to allow                        Nepalese participation Similarly direct assistance to Amnesty                        International which has played an important watch dog role in Nepal or                        the International Commission of Jurists would not only demonstrate our                        continuing concern over human rights but would have a direct effect on those                            HMG officials concerned with the                        administration of justice A SEADAG conference although politically                        sensitive devoted to the broader question of human rights and development                        efforts could serve the same purpose Above all we would urge an increase                        in exchanges and participant grants to be devoted to those directly                        involved be they local administrators or central government authorities in                        the field of lawCARGO WIC initialed	19760115

control the training of police and military personnel and Bangladeshi relations with India	:Conversation with General ZIA	1976-01-19 09:50:00	None	None	TELEGRAMDepartment of StateDACCA 32519 JAN 76 EO 11652: GDS TAGS: PFOR EAIA PORS MILI BG US ACTION: Secstate WASHDCINFO: Amembassy ISLAMABADAmembassy NEW DELHISUMMARY1 General ZIA and I wore able to have several minutes of private                            conversation at a dinner Saturday night Uppermost on his mind                            evidently was a desire for us to understand that they had registered                            our concern that a really effective attack on Bangladeshs population                            problem was long over due He also sprinkled the conversation with                            suggestions for further American aid he evinced some confidence about                            the prospect for continued calm in the country shrugged off rumors                            about any imminent toplevel changes in the Government and reflected                            the usual apprehension about                            India but without any sense of immediate concern END SUMMARY2 ZIA opened our conversation by referring to the points Senator                            MCGOVERN had made to him last week about Bangladeshs urgent population                            problem and said he wanted us to know that they understood this was                            their top priority They realized that they could make no real progress                            in solving their other problems as long as they made no progress in                            bringing down the rate of population growth He said they had now                            designated Sattar one of their best and most effective people as the                            Secretary in charge of population matters and expected this program to                            get moving They would also assign more and better people to this work                            and would also bring in more women I said I was pleased to hear this as                            both here and in Washington during my recent consultation I had been                            hearing more and more expressions of concern what had been considered                            quite frankly an unsatisfactory record in this area Questions were                            being raised about purpose of the enormous amounts of aid we are putting                            in Bangladesh if there were so little to show in the way of checking the                            population growth3 Here and there in the conversation the General returned to suggestions                            about American assistance At one point asked if we could help meet one                            of their pressing problems in the education area by making it possible                            for tem to build recreational                            facilities at their universities to offer the students some useful                            channel for their energies when they were not in school a problem which                            he thought was serious one in Bangladesh He hoped we could help them                            build a complex of swimming pools gymnasiums and other facilities for                            sport and recreation When I tried to turn this aside by pointing out                            that it was one thing for us go to the congress for fertilizer                            foodgrains and contraceptives but quite another to suggest that we build                            swimming pools the General persisted and asked us to consider providing                            at least the foreign exchange component with them Bangladesh Government                            taking care of the local taking care of the local currency needs I told                            him Mr Gardiner Assistant Administrator in AID for Bangladesh and                            other countries in this area arriving on Sunday and that I would discuss                            this matter him He also mentioned that during the MCGOVERN visit he had                            discussed with the Senator and Charge Cheslaw the possibility of our providing police training                            he said he would like to send a group of their police to New York City                            where our methods of combating crime would be helpful to Bangladeshs                            police in dealing with miscreants hereand also our supplying them with                            light equipment such as rifle and communications gear for their police                            I said I knew this request which we had conveyed to Washington but                            that he would know from our previous conversations that we were primarily interested in using                            our resources to help them in agricultural development and family                            planning the crucial areas where we could help best I said in this                            connection that we were working right now on the question of the further                            foodgrain deliveries we would make for the rest of the year We also                            discussed the recent request DACCAs 0300 for 50 million in budget                            support and I suggested to General ZIA that he should not be optimistic                            about this possibility I told him that I understood he had also                            suggested that we should have a military attache in the Embassy I said                            that this matter was under review and that perhaps I would have                            something more to say about it before long4 With respect to General ZIAs request for police training and                            equipment British High Commissioner Smallman told me on Sunday that ZIA                            also raised this question with him at the same dinner pursuing lower                            level requests which the British had already received from the BDG Smallman says he told ZIA that there                            might be a possibility of the British doing something about training but                            discouraged him from thinking that the British would be able to provide                            any further communications equipment beyond that which had supplied                            under an earlier program He said they were also under pressure from                            Commodore Khan for naval aid but that he had told                            the Commodore that any such aid would have to be on a sales basis5 ZIA made the inevitable critical reference to India but did not dwell                            on the subject or show acute concern about the present state of                            relations acknowledging in fact that they were now a little better than                            they had been He said it was surprising how much objectionable material                            about Bangladesh was printed in the Indian press and also surprising how                            this could happen under the emergency powers there He referred to the                            robbing of a Hindu temple the Indian High Commissioner had mentioned                            this same case to me earlier in the week and said the Indians had made                            a fuss about it When they had looked into it they had found that the                            temple had been looted by seven thieves four of whom were Moslem and                            three of whom were Hindu so that it was just a case of ordinary                            thievery of the kind they were always running into He said that in fact                            they had had not one single real incident of communal difficulties since                            the change in Government I commented that this was obviously a crucial                            issue for New Delhi and we had been pleased to see the special concern                            shown for it here6 With respect to his domestic affairs ZIA made the points that he had                            been trying to bring about more decentralization of government to                            encourage the work of private enterprise and to continue to hold                            smuggling under more effective control In answer to my questions ZIA                            expressed confidence about the outlook for continued calm the country and said that discipline                            in the armed forces was not a problem at present When I mentioned that                            I had heard rumors that important changes might be about to take place                            at the top he said these rumors had been circulating for a month now                            and shrugged them off The rumors we have beard in the last few days                            have it that President Sayem has                            resigned with an early effective date and that former Chief Justice                                Siddiqi will become                            President7 COMMENT This was in view of my home leave my first meeting with ZIA                            since his emergence as the man effectively in charge of Bangladesh I                            found him as relaxed softspoken and friendly as ever and showing no                            signs of strain under his new responsibilities He looks and acts if                            anything as though he is enjoying being in charge His almost naive                            approach to the possibilities of American aid area reminder however                            that he has  quite understandably in view of his youth and background                             some limitations of perspective I told him that I would like to bring                            in Assistant AID Administrator Gardiner to see him this week which he                            readily agreed to so we should have occasion later this week to report                            further on his

DEPARTMENT                            IS RELUCTANT TO RECOGNIZE THESE SIGNS OR AT LEAST SLOW TO DO SO THIS                            BECOMES A PROBLEM IN ITSELF AND IS THE SUBJECT OF THIS BRIEF ESSAY2 THE TACTIC INITIATED AT THIS MISSION ON THE INSTRUCTIONS OF THE                            PRESIDENT AND THE SECRETARY OF STATE HAS BEEN TO RESPOND TO ATTACK BY                            COUNTERATTACK A RECENT ARTICLE IN THE LONDON TIMES DESCRIBED US AS                            HAVING TAKEN THE WAR TO THE ENEMY THIS WAS GENEROUS BUT PERHAPS NOT                            ACCURATE SAVE ON A VERY FEW ISSUES SUCH AS THE PROPOSAL OF A WORLD                            WIDE AMNESTY FOR POLITICAL PRISONERS OUR POSITION AT THE UNITED NATIONS                            HAS BEEN REACTIVE FROM A DISTANCE IT MAY HAVE APPEARED CONFRONTATIONAL                            BUT THIS IS SIMPLY BECAUSE THE UNITED NATIONS GENERAL ASSEMBLY HAD                            BECOME THE SETTING OF SUSTAINED DAILY ATTACKS ON THE UNITED STATES                            SUCH THAT OUR COUNTERATTACKS MADE IT LOOK LIKE ALL HELL WAS BREAKING                            LOOSE UP HERE ACTUALLY WE HAD A NORMAL SESSION WHICH LOOKED ABNORMAL                            ONLY BECAUSE WE HAD GOT INTO THE PRACTICE OF RESPONDING IN WAYS WHICH                            OTHERWISE WOULD SEEM QUITE NORMAL AND PREDICTABLE I RECALL A LUNCHEON                            EARLY IN THE FALL AT WHICH I WAS ASKING THE YUGOSLAV AMBASSADOR TO TRY                            TO UNDERSTAND OUR CONCERN THAT THE DECOLONIZATION COMMITTEE THE                            COMMITTEE OF TWENTYFOUR OF WHICH HIS COUNTRY IS A MEMBER HAD SEEMED                            SO DETERMINED TO LAUNCH AN INSURGENCY IN PUERTO RICO BY GIVING OFFICIAL                            OBSERVER STATUS TO THE PUERTO RICAN LIBERATION MOVEMENT WHICH STATUS                            HAD ALREADY BEEN ACCORDED BY THE NONALIGNED AT THEIR LIMA MEETING IN                            AUGUST IN THE MOST PLACATORY WAY I SUGGESTED THAT HE CERTAINLY WOULD                            NOT LIKE THE UNITED STATES TO START SUPPORTING SOME CROATIAN LIBERATION                            MOVEMENT AT THE UNITED NATIONS WELL HE SURE WOULDNT HE TURNED PURPLE                            AND STARTED RAVING ABOUT FASCISM IN NO TIME OUR EMBASSY IN BELGRADE WAS                            BEING ASKED FOR AN EXPLANATION OF THIS OUTRAGEOUS PROVOCATION                            FORTUNATELY OUR AMBASSADOR THERE WAS NOT ABOUT TO BE INTIMIDATED BUT IT                            IS THE FACT THAT THE YUGOSLAV REACTION WAS GENERALLY SPEAKING NORMAL                            WHILE OUR WILLINGNESS TO PUT UP WITH VASTLY GREATER PROVOCATIONS HAS                            BEEN SINGULAR WHATEVER THE ORIGINAL SOURCES OF THIS POLICY IT CAME TO                            BE DEFENDED ON THE GROUNDS THAT TO DO OTHERWISE  TO RESIST AGGRESSIVE                            ACTS  WOULD SEEM UNFRIENDLY AND WOULD LEAD TO EVEN GREATER AGGRESSION                            NOW CLEARLY THOSE INVOLVED WOULD OBJECT TO THIS CHARACTERIZATION AND                            WOULD ARGUE THAT THEY ONLY OPPOSE NEEDLESSLY PROVOCATIVE RESPONSES BUT                            IT IS THE EXPERIENCE OF THIS MISSION THAT ALMOST ANY RESPONSE WILL BE                            CHARACTERIZED AS NEEDLESSLY PROVOCATIVE THIS DOES NOT TAKE PLACE AT THE                            HIGHEST LEVELS OF THE DEPARTMENT BUT IS ENDEMIC TO THE SYSTEM FOR                            MONTHS THE RUMOR MILLS IN WASHINGTON HAVE GROUND OUT ASSERTIONS OR                            INSINUATIONS THAT THE US MISSION TO THE UNITED NATIONS HAS BEEN                            NEEDLESSLY PROVOCATIVE AND IN CONSEQUENCE HAS LOST CRUCIAL VOTES AND HAS                            AROUSED YET NEW LEVELS OF HOSTILITY FROM VARIOUS BLOCS OF NATIONS                            ESPECIALLY THE SOCALLED NONALIGNED3 JUST AS CLEARLY THE NATIONS WHICH HAVE BEEN OBJECTS OF COUNTERATTACK                            HAVE SOUGHT TO CONFIRM THIS VIEW THUS IN AUGUST 1975 THE SECRETARY                            DIRECTED THAT NOTES BE SENT TO A NUMBER OF MEMBERS OF THE DECOLONIZATION                            COMMITTEE TO THE UN STATING THAT SUPPORT                            FOR THE CUBAN RESOLUTION ON PUERTO RICO WOULD BE REGARDED BY US AS AN                            UNFRIENDLY ACT OUR PREVIOUS PATTERN OF NONRESPONSE HAD BECOME SO FIXED                            THAT SOME NATIONS SENSED THAT WE HAD MADE A COSTLY BLUNDER COPIES OF                            OUR NOTE TO THE GOVERNMENT OF TANZANIA CHAIRMAN OF THE COMMITTEE WERE                            REPRODUCED AND DISTRIBUTED AT THE NONALIGNED CONFERENCE AT LIMA AS                            EVIDENCE OF AMERICAN PERFIDY FOR WHICH COMPENSATION WOULD HAVE TO BE                            PAID THE GOVERNMENT OF TANZANIA EVEN SENT COPIES TO AMERICAN                            CONGRESSMEN WHO IT WAS ASSUMED WOULD DEMAND THAT OUR GOVERNMENT RETRACT                            AND MAKE AMENDS IN EARLY JANUARY A STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICER SENT A                            LONG MEMORANDUM TO A NEW YORK TIMES REPORTER REVEALING THE SHOCKING NEWS                            THAT THE UNITED STATES HAD BEGUN THE PRACTICE OF WITHHOLDING FAVORS TO                            NATIONS WHICH VOTED AGAINST US ON IMPORTANT UN ISSUES AND TRYING FOR A                            BIT EXTRA TO THOSE WHO SUPPORTED US4 ALL THE MORE IMPRESSIVE THEN ARE RECENT REPORTS WHICH SUGGEST THAT                            OUR NEW STANCE IS HAVING MORE OR LESS THE EFFECT THAT WAS HOPED                            FORTHAT GOVERNMENTS ARE BEGINNING TO THINK THAT ANTIAMERICAN POSTURES                            AT THE UN AND ELSEWHERE ARE NOT WITHOUT COST AND THAT THE COST HAS TO BE                            CALCULATED5 ITEM IN A REPORT WE ARE SENDING WE DESCRIBE THE REACTION OF THE UN                            ASSISTANT SECRETARY GENERAL FOR SPECIAL POLITICAL QUESTIONS ABDULRAHIM                            FARAH OF SOMALIA

OTHERS TO                            OBTAIN ENDORSEMENT FOR THE MPLA IN                            ANGOLA FARAH ASCRIBED SOME OF THE SUCCESS TO THE SERIOUS CONSIDERATION                            AS HE SAW IT GIVEN BY AFRICANS TO VOA                            REPORTS THAT US AID WOULD BE DECREASED TO THOSE COUNTRIES IN AFRICA NOT                            SYMPATHETIC TO US POSITIONS THE OFFICER WHO MET WITH FARAH DENIED THAT                            THERE WAS ANY BLACK LIST BUT FARAH OBSERVED THAT WHETHER IT EXISTED                            OR NOT AFRICANS WERE TAKING SERIOUSLY AND THAT IT WAS IN HIS WORDS ALL                            TO THE GOOD6 ITEM EMBASSY KHARTOUM REPORTS THAT AT THE AFROARAB SYMPOSIUM ON                            LIBERATION AND DEVELOPMENT HELD THERE EARLIER

LAST GENERAL                            ASSEMBLY THE TANZANIAN REPRESENTATIVE URGED THE MEETING TO TAKE A STAND                            SPECIFICALLY CONDEMNING THE US GOVERNMENT FOR SUCH PRESSURE TACTICS THE                            CONFERENCE DECLINED TO DO SO7 ITEM IN DECEMBER THE UNITED STATES PRESENTED TO THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY                            A REPORT ON POLITICAL PRISONERS IN SOUTH AFRICA THAT WAS WITHOUT                            PRECEDENT IN ITS SPECIFICITY AND DETAIL WE MAY BE SO BOLD AS TO SUGGEST                            THAT IN MOVING FROM THE LEVEL OF ABSTRACT GENERALITY TO THAT OF MINUTE                            PARTICULARS IN THE DISCUSSION OF HUMAN RIGHTS ISSUES AT THE UN WE MAY                            HAVE INTRODUCED A CHANGE IN METHODOLOGY COMPARABLE TO THE APPEARANCE OF                            THE BRANDEIS BRIEF IN AMERICAN LEGAL PRACTICE THIS WAS NOT HOWEVER                            THE REACTION OF THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY WHERE THE DELEGATES BARELY                            LISTENED TO MR MITCHELLS STATEMENT THE TANZANIAN DELEGATION WHICH                            SITS NEXT TO OURS NEVER INTERRUPTED A NOISY CONFERENCE ABOUT SOME                            WHOLLY UNRELATED MATTER THE CHAIRMAN OF THE APARTHEID COMMITTEE NEVER                            CEASED WALKING ABOUT THE ASSEMBLY CHAMBER TALKING TO OTHER DELEGATES                            WHILST OURS WAS SPEAKING FROM THE PODIUM SUCH WAS THE RECEPTION GIVEN                            BY THE VERY SAME AFRICANS WHO HAD APPEALED TO US FOR YEARS TO MAKE THIS                            KIND OF STATEMENT WE WERE NOT AMUSED WITHIN TEN MINUTES I PROTESTED TO                            THE TANZANIAN AMBASSADOR WHO WAS NOT HIMSELF PRESENT A MISSION                            OFFICER PROTESTED TO THE CHAIRMAN OF THE APARTHEID COMMITTEE IN THE                            WEEKS THAT FOLLOWED THIS MISSION DID INDEED VERGE ON THE NEEDLESSLY                            PROVOCATIVE AS WE MISSED NO OPPORTUNITY TO SUGGEST THAT THE BEHAVIOR OF                            THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY THAT DAY CAST GENUINE DOUBT ON THE SERIOUSNESS OF                            THE ANTIAPARTHEID POSITIONS MOST GOVERNMENTS ASSUME TODAY HOWEVER WE                            LEARN THAT THE APARTHEID COMMITTEE HAS REPRODUCED IN ONE OF ITS                            PUBLICATIONS A CONDENSED VERSION OF THE MITCHELL BRIEF THIS IS THE                            FIRST OCCASION ANY OF US HERE CAN RECALL ANY SUCH FAVORABLE RESPONSE TO                            THE UNITED STATES BY THAT COMMITTEE8 THESE ARE MERELY ITEMS MUCH MORE IMPORTANT IS THE PATTERN OF VOTING                            AND DECISION MAKING ON MAJOR ISSUES ANGOLA IS SUCH AN ISSUE CLEARLY                            THE PATTERN OF AMERICAN DIPLOMACY HAS BEEN COMPLEX IN THIS MATTER AS IT                            SHOULD BE AND THIS MISSION PROBABLY DOES NOT EVEN KNOW ABOUT MOST OF                            THE MEASURES WE TOOK TO BRING ABOUT THE SUCCESSFUL OUTCOME AT ADDIS                            ABABA BUT WE ARE CLEAR THAT WE TOOK THE ISSUE HEAD ON HERE IN NEW YORK                            ON DECEMBER 8 A ROUTINE ANTISOUTH AFRICA RESOLUTION PASSING THE                            GENERAL ASSEMBLY WAS AMENDED TO INCLUDE A CONDEMNATION OF INTERVENTION                            IN ANGOLA ZAIRE PROTESTED THAT SOUTH AFRICA WAS NOT THE ONLY FOREIGN                            POWER INTERVENING THERE THE UNITED STATES FOLLOWED BY READING TO THE                            GENERAL ASSEMBLY THE MORNING NEW YORK TIMES RECOUNTING SOVIET AND CUBAN                            INVOLVEMENT EUROPEAN ARMIES WERE BACK IN AFRICA WE SAID THE                            RECOLONIZATION OF THE CONTINENT HAD BEGUN THE QUESTION WAS WHETHER THE                            GENERAL ASSEMBLY CARED SO LITTLE ABOUT THIS THAT IT WOULD NOT EVEN                            ACKNOWLEDGE WHAT WAS HAPPENING NOW THIS PROVOKED MANY DELEGATIONS NO                            DOUBT BUT DEBATE ON THE RESOLUTION WAS IMMEDIATELY HALTED AND TWO DAYS                            LATER THE AMENDMENT WAS WITHDRAWN9 THERE IS NOTHING SURPRISING ABOUT THIS THE NONALIGNED OR THE GROUP                            OF SEVENTYSEVEN OR WHATEVER ARE GROUPS MADE UP OF EXTRAORDINARILY                            DISPARATE NATIONS WITH GREATLY DISPARATE INTERESTS THEIR RECENT                            BLOCLIKE UNITY WAS ARTIFICIAL AND WAS BOUND TO BREAK UP MAINTAINING                            SOLID RANKS WAS SIMPLY TOO EXPENSIVE FOR TOO MANY MEMBERS AS WITNESS                            THE COST OF SAYING NOTHING ABOUT THE OPEC PRICE INCREASES WHICH HURT THE DEVELOPING NATIONS FAR                            MORE THAN THE DEVELOPED ONES JUST SO ANGOLA IT IS NO ACCIDENT THAT                            SAVE FOR CONGO NOT A SINGLE AFRICAN COUNTRY ANYWHERE NEAR ANGOLA HAS                            RECOGNIZED THE MPLA REGIME WITH ITS RUSSIAN ARMS AND CUBAN GURKHAS AT                            THE RECENT GENERAL ASSEMBLY THE NONALIGNED WERE SIMILARLY DIVIDED IN                            THE VOTING ON THE SAHARA AND ON TIMOR10 TO REPEAT THE SURPRISING THING IS THAT THE DEPARTMENT IS HAVING SO                            MUCH DIFFICULTY RECOGNIZING THAT OUR PRESENT POLICY WHICH IS DESIGNED                            TO HELP WHAT COMES NATURALLY IS BEGINNING TO SHOW SOME RESULTS THE                            DEPARTMENT RESPONSE ON THE ZIONISM VOTE AT THE LAST UNGA WAS A CLASSIC INSTANCE OF REFUSING TO                            ACKNOWLEDGE WHAT WAS IN TRUTH A CONSIDERABLE SUCCESS NOW THE FACTS ARE                            THESE IN THE CRUCIAL VOTE TO POSTPONE CONSIDERATION OF THE RESOLUTION                            NINETEEN SUBSAHARAN NATIONS EITHER VOTED WITH US OR WERE ABSENT OR                            ABSTAINED TWENTYONE VOTED AGAINST US ALMOST A PERFECT SPLIT LEAVING                            OUT THOSE SUBSAHARAN NATIONS WITH SUBSTANTIAL MOSLEM POPULATIONS THE                            VOTE BECOMES EIGHTEEN FOR THE US POSITION AS AGAINST ONLY TWELVE                            OPPOSED IN OTHER WORDS THE UNITED STATES HAD QUITE A SUCCESS WITH                            THESE AFRICAN NATIONS YET FROM THE DAY OF THE VOTE WE HAVE FOUND                            OURSELVES TALKING TO REPORTERS WHO HAVE BEEN TOLD IN THE STATE                            DEPARTMENT THAT BECAUSE THE US DELEGATION HAD BEEN NEEDLESSLY                            PROVOCATIVE CRUCIAL AFRICAN VOTES HAD BEEN LOST NO ONE IN THE                            DEPARTMENT HAS EVER HAD THE COURTESY OR COURAGE TO NAME A SINGLE SUCH                            CRUCIAL VOTE WHATEVER CRUCIAL MEANS THE FACT IS WE WERE NEVER ANYWHERE                            NEAR WINNING ON THE ZIONISM ISSUE BUT IN ANY EVENT THE REAL PHENOMENON                            TO EXPLAIN IS HOW WE CAME TO GET SO MANY VOTES NOT WHY WE DIDNT GET                            MORE BUT THOSE IN THE DEPARTMENT WHO WERE CONVINCED WE WOULD GET NONE                            ARE IMPERVIOUS TO THE EVIDENCE THAT THIS IS NOT SO THIS MISSION DOES                            NOT EXPECT SUCH PERSONS TO CHANGE THEIR MINDS WE DO ASK HOWEVER THAT                            OUT OF A DECENT RESPECT FOR THEIR PROFESSION THEY STOP BLABBING TO THE                            PRESS WHAT IS NOT SO11 MORE GENERALLY AND MORE IMPORTANTLY IT APPEARS TO THIS MISSION THAT                            THERE IS ENOUGH EVIDENCE IN TO MAKE A GENERAL INTERIM ASSESSMENT OF OUR                            NEW POSTURE AT THE UNITED NATIONS WE LIKE TO THINK THAT WE WOULD BE                            OPEN TO EVIDENCE OF FAILURE AND ARE AWARE THAT NO ONE SHOULD ACCEPT OUR                            OWN ASSESSMENT OF SUCCESS WITHOUT SOME INDEPENDENT ENQUIRY BUT WE DO                            FEAR THAT THERE NECESSARILY REMAINS IN THE DEPARTMENT A LARGE FACTION                            WHICH HAS AN INTEREST IN OUR PERFORMANCE BEING JUDGED TO HAVE FAILED                            THIS FACTION HAS NOT HESITATED TO PASS THIS ASSESSMENT ON TO THE PRESS                            AND TO CONGRESS AND TO PARTS OF THE DEPARTMENT THAT OTHERWISE WOULD                            HAVE NO VIEW ONE WAY OR THE OTHER THIS IS BAD FOR THE PRESIDENTS                            POLICY WHICH THE SECRETARY STRIVES TO CARRY OUT AT A TIME WHEN WE HAVE                            SO FEW ALLIES AND SO MANY OF THEM ARE SLIPPING INTO ALMOST IRREVERSIBLE                            PATTERNS OF APPEASEMENT BASED ON THE ASSUMPTION THAT AMERICAN POWER IS                            IRREVERSIBLY DECLINING WE WOULD HOPE THAT SOME BRAVE SPIRITS IN
