frus1969-76v27d180	180 Telegram From the Embassy in Iran to the Department of State	None	1976-08-01 09:20:00	None	None	7765 For the Secretary from Ambassador Subject: Your Visit to Tehran: The                        Shahs Mood and Major Issues1 Complicating factor in our work these past weeks of planning your visit                        has been strong desire on part of GOI to                        make your stay as useful to you as                        possible There has been great reluctance to make any arrangements that                        might not match your preferences Clearly Iranians see your trip in very                        personal terms and in context of high regard Shah has for you You will                        find the Shah as cordial as ever and appreciative of your efforts in this                        region and the world at large2 There are however two features of the Shahs mood that have acquired                        considerable importance since you last saw him First is Iranian feeling of                        being pushed around or used by the US Second is a concern that the US                        lacks political will to deal effectively with its adversaries and that it                        may retreat to neoisolationism Underlying both of these concerns is GOI frustration over diminished oil revenues                        persisting world inflation and heavy Iranian demands for development                        Although crude offtake has recovered from the low levels reached 68 months                        ago cash flow problem is still quite serious and large number of projects                        have had to be cut back or delayed In other words Shahs grandiose vision                        of Iranian development has had to be scaled down both in terms of nations                        international role and civilian and military development programs As you                        are aware Shah is not a leader who likes to operate within externally                        imposed constraints3 For this reason he is particularly sensitive to what may appear to being                        pushed around by the US mainly on four issues:A Basic disagreement between US and Iran over Irans plans for nuclear                        development center on our desire for firm controls over reprocessing of                        nuclear fuels and Irans unwillingness to concede any outside interference                        which may derogate from its sovereignty Iran wants our technology and                        financial participation in development of nuclear capability which Shah                        expects to fill gap as petroleum output declines during decades ahead Iran                        wants our assistance on commercial terms without our political interference                        which is perceived as suggesting that Iran is somewhat untrustworthy or can                        be treated as a second class power We hear from Ansary that this issue is becoming increasingly irritating                        to Shah and he very probably will raise it with you feeling that it is a                        matter too important to be left to technocrats cf Tehran 7123Telegram 7123 from Tehran July 13 pointed out that                            the Shah should be notified that the United States had no plans to                            provide technology or equipment for a nuclear reprocessing plant                            Ibid P8400901744B Second issue is apparent impasse we have reached in CIEC deliberations                        over maintenance of purchasing power and LDC debt rescheduling Iran sees our role as that of status quo                        power unwilling to take any concrete actions on these problems but                        preferring to study them interminably Here we have conflict not only with                        Iranian desire to reorder world economy on more favorable terms to its own                        interests but also Iranian aspirations to act as a leader of LDC groups on these two questionsC Third issue under the heading of US pushing Iran around has to do with                        the way we handle our defense business here Although we can offer technical                        explanations for correctness of most of our actions we have not been able                        to deal with growing Iranian feeling that their defense purchases from the                        US are being handled on an unequal basis not with parity and respect they                        expect in a sellerbuyer relationship GOI                        does not understand why for example interest is not paid on FMS funds held by DOD for Iranian purchases We know interest payments are                        contrary to US law and we are trying to make arrangements which will                        satisfy Iran Nevertheless when they put that incident together with fact                        that we delayed issuance Spruance ship deliveries                        while requiring advance payments it makes Iranians think they are being                        used It annoys them when we deny release of sophisticated new hardware                        which is standard on planes or ships we have agreed to sell Iran You may                        hear of specific defense matters from the Shah especially oilforarms                        barter which may be only means moneyshort GOI can use to finance new weapons purchasesD The Shah is by now pretty well convinced that we have been teasing him                        along on efforts to work out a bilateral oil agreement over these many                        months and that we are really not serious about trying to finalize an                        arrangement Nevertheless he will continue to play the string out as long as                        we are prepared toTelegram 229942 to Tehran                            September 17 transmitted a revised proposal from Zarb to Ansary which contained a new formula for negotiation                            Ibid D7603501267 See Document                        1894 Second major element in Shahs attitude is feeling that US is undergoing                        crisis of political will He recognizes effects on national morale of                        WatergateViet Nam trauma and peculiar political process we must undergo                        during election year He hopes that mood he perceives in US is temporary                        but given attitude of Congress on arms sales and his lack of familiarity                        with Democratic Party leadership he fears I believe our current                        preoccupations may be longer lasting As an aside I should note that the                        Shahs perception of US Congressional attitude towards Iran and particularly                        Irans defense buildup leads him to buy now rather than wait until                        attitudes become even more difficult Of course these protective                        acquisitions only exacerbate the problem with Congress and the press5 Shahs perception of US indecision and weakness coincides with his view of                        more determined Soviet attitude towards Middle East and Indian Ocean regions                        cf Tehran 6934In telegram 6934 from Tehran                            July 8 Helms conveyed the                            Shahs suspicion that the Soviets hoped to lull Iran into dropping its                            guard and perhaps reducing its purchases of US arms The Shah was also                            convinced that Iranian terrorists were being funded by the Soviet Union                            National Archives RG 59 Central                            Foreign Policy Files P8400901747 As you know he was                            particularly disturbed by                        Western setback in Angola He has similar fears for leftward evolution in                        Africa generally particularly on the Horn as well as his longstanding                        uneasiness about instability in Arabian Peninsula and along AfghanPakistan                        borders He will probably address these matters6 On Arab questions Shah is deeply concerned by drift in Lebanese crisis                        particularly any development that might endanger Asad and lead to his                        displacement by Syrian elements more favorable to Iraqi Baathists Shah will                        certainly speak to you about his fear of a red crescent formed by Iraq and                        Syria and threatening Jordan even though you have exchanged views on this                        subject in context of Sadats recent visit here For similar reasons he                        fears a Palestinian state which could exert radical pressure first on Jordan                        and then on Saudi Arabia and the smaller Peninsula states As you know he                        places heavy emphasis on Sadats moderating role in this conjuncture but he                        has not altered his relationship to Israel and indeed may have moved to                        strengthen it7 In this connection you should be aware that Israeli Prime Minister                        Yitzhak Rabin secretly visited the Shah in midJuly He came with the                        Israeli Intelligence Chief clandestine arrangements in Iran being made by                            SAVAK The secrecy surrounding the                        visit can be judged by the fact that despite my best efforts at flycasting                        I could elicit nothing from either the Shah or Uri Lubrani the unofficial                        Israeli Ambassador although the latter was glad to tell me about Yigal                        Allons visit early this year cf Tehran 0085Telegram 85 from Tehran January 5 described Allons visit to Tehran                            Ibid P8400961780 Rabins coming here was followed almost                        immediately by General Toufanians                        unexpected visit to Israel also a relatively clandestine event What the                        Iranians and Israelis are specifically cooking up in the arms field remains                        to be ascertained but the Shah has a complex game going with both the                        Israelis and the Egyptians the obvious purpose of which is to exchange or                        at least have available certain kinds of ammunition and weapons which are                        not subject to US Congressional control or veto8 These are the major questions we face as I see it Although both sides                        recognize there are no simple answers the Shah will expect an authoritative                        updating from you on US attitudes in this election year This will                        constitute the best tonic we could administer to IranianUS relations at

  of the highlights of your audience with the Shah as per your request: Begin text1 My audience with the Shah after lunch August 6 at his guest house in                        Nowshahr on the Caspian Sea lasted the better part of three hours It was                        followed by a press conference which I asked the Shah to conduct for the                        American newspapermen traveling with meThe                            transcript of Kissingers joint                            press conference with the Shah on August 6 at Nowshahr is in telegram

    atmosphere of warmth cordiality and privacy Ambassador Helms was the only other individual                        present There were no interruptions so that our discussion was frank and                        intensive The Shah particularly asked me to convey to you his warmest                        regards and he spoke with obvious                        conviction about his personal feeling toward you and the importance he                        attaches to this relationship2 I took the occasion of the audience to cover with the Shah certain of the                        points I intended to make that evening in my toast at the formal dinner                        given at the Foreign Ministry by Minister of Economic Affairs and Finance                            Hushang AnsarySee footnote 3 Document                                181 I wanted to be sure that nothing I would say would                        be an embarrassment to Iran The Shahs reaction was positive He encouraged                        me to speak out I felt that the thrust given in the press to the Senate                        Foreign Relations Subcommittee Report on arms sales to IranSee footnote 4 Document                                179 required a prompt statement which set the United                        StatesIranian relationship in proper historical and current perspective                        believing strongly that we cannot afford to permit an atmosphere of                        ambivalence to develop about an ally who has been as consistently supportive                        of US foreign policy over the years as has Iran You have the text of my                        toast as finally delivered3 During the audience the Shah agreed to a formulation on the issue of                        nuclear reprocessing which the next day we hammered out with American and                        Iranian experts into an approach which I think will be adaptable not only to                        Iran but to other countries who wish to buy nuclear reactorsThe report of the Atomic Energy Committee of the Joint                            Economic Commission is in telegram

details                        of this formulation I would prefer to cover the whole matter with you when I                        return to Washington because I believe that you will be interested in the                        possibilities it holds for dealing with key Congressional figures like                        Senators Ribicoff Javits Glenn Percy etc Sievering of ERDA and Kratzer of                        State participated in the discussions and will be working in the remaining                        days of this trip to try to refine what we have in mind and what we hope to                        achieve I was encouraged by this aspect of my Tehran consultations4 The Shah and I discussed at some length the best tactics for handling                        notification to Congress of Irans intention to purchase the F16 aircraft                        The Shah is obviously anxious to acquire some of his 300 F16s 160 plus                        others over time as soon as possible since his F14s will lack F16 support                        until deliveries are made The Shah underlined as he has so frequently in                        the past that he wants to keep his Air Force supplied entirely with                        American equipment He made it clear that he does not want to introduce into                        his Air Force airplanes of any other nation but he subtly pointed out that                        the reluctance of the United States to make deliveries would oblige him to                        go elsewhere He noted that Israel has offered for sale to Iran almost any Israeli military                        equipment Iran wants We know that Iranian Vice Minister of War General                            Toufanian recently visited                        Israel and looked over its arsenal The Shah added that President Giscard                        would be making a State visit to Tehran in early October and that he hoped                        the F16 question will have been decided by that time since he is under                        constant pressure from the French to purchase Mirages I assured the Shah                        that I would discuss this matter with you and that we would make the                        decision as to when to place the F16 purchase before Congress5 The Shah raised with me the same questions about electronic                        countermeasures that Ambassador Zahedi had earlier taken up with Brent ScowcroftIn backchannel                            message WH61035 to Tehran August 1 Scowcroft notified Helms that Zahedi                            had approached him regarding the possibility of Iran receiving access to                            electronic warfare equipment on a par with NATO Library of Congress Manuscript Division Kissinger                            Papers Box CL153 Iran Chronological Files 1 August1 November                            1976 I went over carefully the problems we have in Washington                        with the general request that Iran be put on the same basis as NATO I recommended to the Shah that rather                        than approaching the problem in this fashion he ask us for specific items                        of ECM gear arguing his needs and                        requirements for each one I assured him that we would give serious                        consideration to a few highpriority items at a time and that these requests                        should be handled securely either through Ambassador Helms or to Scowcroft and to Eagleburger at the Department The following day I informed                        General Toufanian of our willingness                        to make available one particular item that the Iranians desired Scowcrofts message on this subject was                        most timely and enabled me to show the Iranians that we were attempting to                        move cooperatively on their requests in this sensitive area6 The Shah and I discussed the oil barter negotiations between Iran and                        various American weapons manufacturers I pointed out the concern felt in                        some quarters of Washington that Iranian purchases of voting stock in                        American oil companies might be regarded as undesirable The Shah hastened                        to assure me that he did not rpt not want                        any stock in Ashland or the New England Power Company NEPCO both of which                        are involved with General Dynamics and Litton in that particular                        negotiation He said that Ashland and NEPCO had offered stock but that Iran                        would not under any circumstances accept the offer On the Occidental Oil                        Company agreement which has been so much publicized the Shah indicated that                        thus far the deal is not working It appears that Occidental is making                        certain conditions which the Iranians are not prepared to accept These                        matters are still in the early stages of negotiation and the deal is in no                        sense finalized The Shah made the additional point however that the                        United States should make up its mind to what extent it is going to permit foreign purchases of voting                        stock in oil companies Under existing circumstances he commented there                        are no guidelines He emphasized that in such matters he would scrupulously                        abide by the stated wishes of the United States Government7 On the question of CIEC deliberations I went carefully over the problems                        which we feel that Iranian attitudes are causing in these meetingsAccording to a checklist that Atherton and Oakley provided for Kissingers talks with the Shah                            August 5 Iran was pressing for indexation of oil prices and                            acrosstheboard debt relief for the poorer LDCs in part to divert their dissatisfaction from the                            financial assistance they were getting from Iran and other oil                            producers Ford Library National Security Adviser NSC Middle East and South Asian Affairs                            Staff: Convenience Files Box 5 Iran 11 The Shah listened                        carefully and indicated that he was not aware that the Iranian position on                        the issue of rescheduling debts was causing difficulties He then launched                        into a justification of oil prices a detailed presentation of price                        increases on military and industrial equipment in the United States and his                        abiding desire to work out some kind of an arrangement with the United                        States which would permit the special relationship between the two countries                        to flourish in an atmosphere of inflation and continually rising prices He                        spoke of the various suggestions he has made such as indexation barter                        arrangements bilateral oil agreements and so forth He repeated again that                        the present price of oil has still not forced the United States to get                        serious about developing alternative sources of energy8 I covered with the Shah the proposal that I intend to make to Prime                        Minister Bhutto on the Pakistan                        reprocessing plant issue ie that we will provide A7 aircraft in exchange

acceptable third                            country partner or an exchange with the United States of irradiated                            fuel for fresh fuel Kissinger                            made

the end of the                                Ford administration                        The Shah felt that this was a good proposal and that Bhutto would be wise to accept it He                        pointed out again how weak militarily Pakistan is and how much it needs help                        from the United States9 I had ample opportunity to cover with the Shah our detailed views of the                        situation in the Middle East and on developments in the area including the                        shifting alignments of Arab countries As you will have recognized in recent                        months the Shahs perceptions are almost identical with our own He particularly agrees that                        Syria must not fail in Lebanon that the Palestinians must be cut down to                        size and that Egyptian policy must not be permitted to so weaken Syria that                        it brings about a radical crescent of Syria and Iraq backed by the PLO and                        the Libyans The Shah confirmed that he had had an unpublicized visit from                        Prime Minister Rabin in midJuly and that Rabin had made it clear Israel was                        not unhappy about current developments in Lebanon The Shah and I discussed                        the viability of a Geneva Conference and agreed that we had similar                        difficulties in visualizing how one would conduct such a conference and what                        parties should participate at least in the initial stages10 Africa came in for detailed discussion We agreed on the general                        approach and on the fact that it is one area where we should be able to fend                        off Soviet influence since there is no Israeli problem to frustrate our                        relationship with friendly countries and tribal elements holding Western                        allegiances The Shah has agreed to receive Rhodesian nationalist leader                        Joshua Nkomo when he comes to Iran in a week or so He will see what he can                        do to help him since he agrees with us that Nkomo represents a political                        element which we should support End of textHelms	19760808

violence used by SAVAK the Shah denied the claim that                            there were 200000 members in the secret services and questioned other                            figures that journalists cited: You keep on saying that we have several                            hundred thousand political prisoners and we keep on saying that we have                            only 3400 or

violence or have advocated                        violence Hard to tell how many of those mentioned fall into Fraser category                        of political prisoners Several knowledgeable

While this figure                        might not stand up in court of law it is considerably at variance and                        probably much closer to truth than outlandish estimates bandied

taking of life also difficult to establish Both official and                        unofficial sources agree about 100 terrorists have been executed by GOI since 1968 but all these have been put to                        death after extensive judicial proceedings including appeals Within past                        seven months approximately 30 terrorists have been killed while resisting                        arrest usually after prolonged gun battles indicating serious resistance                        There have also been instances where suspected terrorists killed themselves

 subcommittee on August 3 Butler and Professor Georges Levasseur had                            recently published a study of human rights and the legal system in Iran                            for the ICJ National Archives RG 59                            Central Foreign Policy Files D7603010251 George GB Griffins analysis that                            the report was essentially unassailable is in a memorandum to                                Naas June 8 Ibid                            P8700501693 Moreover as indicated in ref B despite moving to oneparty state freedom of discussion appears high                        especially within individual party chapters and at party boards and council                        meetings Several senior party officials have reported their shock at being                        roughly handled during visits to party chapter meetings One has indicated                        two indictments for corruption have resulted from accusations at party                        meetings However party does not indiscriminately criticize government and                        criticism of Shah by officials occurs only in private among close and                        trusted friends if at all Iranians do not enjoy the same freedom of                        expression as Americans do but particularly in Middle East context Iran                        compares favorably with virtually all of its neighbors Restraints are                        subtle and psychological not normally heavyhanded and physical11 With exception of prominent National Iranian Radio and Television Service                        magazine press is privately owned Resurgence Party newspaper Rastahkiz is owned by party which itself receives                        government subsidy but criticizes administration on policies Editors and                        publishers exercise innate caution but there is no prior censorship SAVAK reportedly proofs each paper before                        press runs take place but few articles are cut Ministry of Information                        frequently gives guidance which editors ignore at their peril For example                        prior to Crown Princes recent tour to USSR editors were invited to mute criticism of USSR Prior to recent Kissinger visit editorial criticizing                        Senate arms sales report was at least suggested by GOI Papers are encouraged to have at least one story on the                        Royal family somewhere on front page at least every other day preferably                        every day Instinct for survival is finely honed among Persian press men so                        formal measures of rebuke and punishment are seldom necessary12 Iranian trade unions have made few political noises in recent past but                        umbrella organization Workers Organization of Iran has participated                        actively if quietly in political life Moreover while labor unrest                        receives little publicity here Embassy has heard of several strikes and                        labor demonstrations by individual shop or industrial groups GOI appears to maintain a guiding hand through                        Ministry of Labor but does not exercise rigid control Unions have been                        among leaders in support of antiinflation and pricecutting campaigns                        Labor has 13 members in Parliament and two representatives on party                        Executive Board GOI regards labor as force                        to be consulted when shaping policies but such consultation occurs behind                        public spotlight13 USG has made working level                        representations to security forces concerning treatment of prisoners ref B GOI                        has listened to Embassy but made no formal responses14 Iran does not receive economic assistance but we understand security                        assistance budget has been used to fund ARMISHMAAG positions not paid for by GOI US funds have been used because we have felt it desirable to stress to Iranians the                        independence of advice provided by ARMISHMAAG Chief and his staff In our view human rights                        situation in Iran does not rpt not justify                        application of provisions of Section 502 B of FAA to Iran15 Additional background on human rights in Iran: Persian Government has                        continuously been one of most tolerant in Middle East From time of                        Zoroaster approximately 600 BC religious tolerance has been hallmark of                        Persian state Jews and Armenian Christians have played substantial and                        honorable roles in past Persian dynasties and continue to do so today                        Number of Jewish community leaders have told us they feel their wellbeing                        and security in Iran is directly attributable to protection afforded by                        present regime They are uneasy about condition of Jews in postShah Iran                        Iran also has always been a relatively mobile society and many Prime                        Ministers and Kings including Reza Shah rose up from very humble origins                        On the other hand Iran has always been threatened by external forces and                        more recently internal terrorism For nearly 30 years at least one and                        usually two or three clandestine radios have boomed propaganda at Persia                        Radio Pekye Iran for example frequently calls for students and workers to                        rise up and overthrow the Shahs fascistic rule GOI can be forgiven for assuming this type of programming is                        aimed at violent overthrow of regime GOI                        also believes it has clearly shown connection between local terrorists and                        foreign radicalguerilla forces ref K                        Strong rulers of country present Shah certainly fits this category have                        frequently overlooked strict Constitutional interpretation of civil rights                        where they thought it necessary for security of country Educated Iranians                        frequently like to needle Americans that GOI behaves no differently than Jefferson and Lincoln                        administrations in the US did during periods when America was threatened                        As terrorist threats have grown in past five to eight years SAVAK itself has grown Shah has admitted                            SAVAK has 3000 members ref H This probably does not include people                        who may receive money on sporadic or even semiregular basis for information                        provided in course of other duties16 It is interesting to note greater interest in civil rights among Iranian                        citizenry over past four or five years ICHR reports its caseload has increased fivefold over past four                        years Separate human rights committees exist in seven principal Iranian                        towns Bulk of nearly 1200 Iranian complaints under Universal Declaration of                        Human Rights concern bureaucratic grievences against government ministries                            ICHR has adopted a policy of pursuing                        cases only when interested party has made appeal It adopted this policy                        after pursuing several requests from Amnesty International only to discover                        prisoners had already been free for some time Committee secretary has                        indicated ICHR finds one case in five to                        be solid enough to pursue and almost always gets some redress from government though Committee                        officials admit more difficult cases involving security may not be brought                        to them17 ICHR also works with government to try                        to improve judicial system Shah himself recently called for more                        improvements and less time between arrest and trial Most judicial figures                        in Iran agree Iranian legal system needs major overhaul and even existing                        court system has been major victim of inflation which has forced many judges                        and legal officials to leave office for much better paying private                        positions Recent study indicates between 10000 and 20000 cases a year                        remain untried for lack of personnel These problems plus rapid urban growth                        have also led to increased crime rate in many Iranian cities especially in                        Tehran Urban citizenry are beginning to insist on improvements in police                        effectiveness as well as judicial handling of criminals18 Ref C gives Embassy reaction to Butler report While Embassy does not                        want to comment in detail on Butlers testimony it seems useful to                        underline that Butler himself appears to understand difficulties in                        obtaining information on human rights problem para 3 ref J and also infers incidence of political                        arrests is declining This agrees with Embassy view of unfolding civil                        rights situation over past year Embassy disagrees with Butlers statement                        that there is no freedom of press or freedom to strike Evidence clearly                        indicates otherwise Even if strikes are technically illegal they occur and                        are normally dealt with by subtler forms of negotiation rather than armed                        force On freedom of press question it instructive to note that numerous                        foreign publications highly critical of regime and Shah circulate freely                        Most recent example was Time of August 16 which                        addressed torture issue in Iran at lengthHelms	19760818

313Summary: Iraqi delegation offers amnesty to remaining                        Kurds in Iran Barzani group is about to recommend its acceptance and to                        encourage Kurds return to Iraq End summary1 Kurdish liaison officer called on EmbOff August 3 to inform USG                        three Iraqi members of recent visiting diplomatic mission met July 31 with                        10 Kurdish representatives through good offices of the Iranian Interior                        Ministry Kurdish representatives were led by Abdul Wahab Atrushi former                        Kurdish Democratic Party KDP military                        bureau head and Governor of Arbil 197074 Iraqis were: Sadoun Mosleh                        alTikriti Iraqi Secretary of the Committee for Northern Kurdish Affairs                        Col Mohsen Khalil formerly security chief of Arbil and Abdul Samad Hamid                        Liaison officer between the Revolutionary Command Council RCC and foreign governments Also present was                        Salah Samarmad Cultural Attach of the Iraqi Embassy2 Purpose of meeting was Iraqi delegation presentation of Revolutionary                        Command Council offer of amnesty for all past happenings Iraqi delegation                        had wanted to visit and make pitch to various groups of Kurds by helicopter                        but had apparently been denied permission by Iranians who then arranged                        meeting and withdrew3 RCC amnesty offer would not repeat not be                        publicly announced and would include all Kurds presently in Iran except                        General Barzani his sons Idris and Masoud and a nephew Mohammad Khalid                        Kurdish refugees in Iran would be taken back into original Kurdish areas of                        autonomyArbil Suleimaineh and Duhok Residents of one area may be                        returned to another area but all would return to the north rather than be relocated in southern Iraq                        Individuals would be given their old jobs back except for military                        personnel who would be relocated in civilian employment Anyone not                        accepting this amnesty within the deadline not yet specified but probably                        between 30 and 60 days would have their Iraqi citizenship withdrawn4 Kurdish delegation asked why Barzani and his family were to be excluded                        Iraqis replied Barzanis not welcome in Iraq because something might happen                        and in any event they doubted Barzani would want to return Kurds also                        asked about relocation of Kurds within Iraq from north to south and were                        assured this had been stopped This confirmed what Kurds had learned from                        their own sources The Iraqi delegation also said that if the relocation of                        Kurds now in Iran goes well those in southern Iraq might be given a chance                        to return to their homes in the north5 Kurdish source told EmbOff political                        leadership of Kurdish community here had been considering the matter and had                        virtually decided to recommend acceptance of amnesty Factors cited were: 1                        failure of Iranian Government to live up to promises regarding relocation                        2 increasing SAVAK arrests without                        charge of lower level Kurds and other indications of Iranian pressure and                        3 general feeling that by far the majority of Kurds would be better off in                        Iraq than in Iran under currently prevailing conditions6 Final decision will await Barzani return from the US and Kurdish liaison                        officer asked if we knew when this would be saying Iranian contacts had                        told him Barzani would be back soon EmbOff replied this accorded with our information but we had                        no specific details Kurdish contact said Iranians have not formally swung                        their support behind amnesty offer but pressure was beginning7 Kurds know some recent arrests without charge have been followed by SAVAK requests that Kurds who were picked up                        cooperate with SAVAK in obtaining                        information on Iraq both now and in the future Only reason SAVAK has given KDP leaders for picking up Kurds has been that those arrested                        had been seen visiting foreign Embassies Kurds believe Iranians concerned                        about their own security as well as opportunities for penetration of Iraq if                        full amnesty takes place8 Kurdish liaison officer indicated he was leaving in three days for London                        for an unspecified period to assist in reorganization of the Kurdish                        Democratic Party abroad Gave name of new contact who will be in touch with                        Embassy Urging information be kept

                        KDP supporters in Syria Jordan and                        Turkey and although these were not involved in active fighting now                        decision had been made to reorganize the party both in those countries and in Europe to take advantage of                        future opportunities Major aim of reorganization is creation of new                        political bureau with younger more active leadership at all levels                        Reorganization is already going on within Iraq and among Kurds here While                        General Barzani will remain KDP leader                        many want younger fresher blood in other top positionsHelms	19760803

INCIDENTS WOULD                            LIKELY OCCUR IN THE FUTUREC VIEW THAT THE MOVE TO DEFCON 3 AND DEPLOYMENT OF THE F4 SQUADRON WERE                            APPROPRIATED BELIEF THAT ONE NEEDED TO PROCEED ON TWO TRACKS:1 ISSUANCE OF THE STRONGEST POSSIBLE PROTEST TO INCLUDE DEMAND FOR                            APOLOGY FOR REPARATION AND FOR GUARANTEE OF NON RECURRENCEALL WITH                            THE RECOGNITION THAT THE COMMUNISTS ARE NOT LIKELY TO BE                            FORTHCOMING2 DELIBERATE DEVELOPMENT OF APPROPRIATE COUNTERACTION EMPHASIZING THAT

POINT WHICH HE WAS SUBSEQUENTLY TO RE EMPHASIZE HERE I CONJECTURE                            THAT THE PRESIDENT WAS REFERRING TO THE OVERALL DISPOSITION AND                            PROCEDURES LONG

THAT ITS VIEWS ON COUNTERMEASURE                            GENERALLY PARALLELED HIS THERE WOULD MOST CERTAINLY BE A STRONG PROTEST                            LODGED IN THE FIRST INSTANCE BY ME

CONTINGENCY THAT THEY WOULD IF                            THEY DID IT WAS ESSENTIAL THAT THEY COME OUT SECOND BEST IN HIS                            ESTIMATE THE BEST WAY TO INSURE THE SUCCESS OF THE
