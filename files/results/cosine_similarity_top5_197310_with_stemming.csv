FOLLOWING ARE OUR PRELIMINARY IDEAS ON PROPOSED CEAUSESCU TRIP:\n2.  CEUASESCUS INTERESTS AND SENSITIVITIES: DESPITE VERBAL FOCUS ON ECONOMIC MATTERS--AND THESE TOO ARE SIGNIFICANT--MOST IMPORTANT CEAUSESCU PURPOSE WILL BE ENHANCEMENT OF ROMANIAS SECURITY AND INDEPENDENCE BY TAKING ONE MORE STEP IN CAREFULLY CONSIDERED STITCH-BY- STITCH WEAVING OF NEW FABRIC OF RELATIONS WITH WIDE VARIETY OF COUNTRIES OUTSIDE WARSAW PACT SYSTEM.  VISUAL EFFECT IS KEY AND WHAT IS NOT SAID IS JUST AS IMPORTANT AS WHAT IS SAID, IN ORDER TO EMPHASIZE INDEPENDENCE WHILE NOT EXPOSING ROMANIA TO ANTI-SOVIET CHARGES.  PUBLIC STATEMENTS AND TOASTS SHOULD REFLECT THIS SITUATION; THEY SHOULD BE NEITHER TOO CAUTIOUS NOR TOO BOLD; THEY SHOULD PLAY ON CHORDS OF ROMANIAN INTEREST IN ""PRINCIPLES"" LIKE SOVEREIGNTY, INDEPENDENCE, ROLE FOR ALL COUNTRIES, LARGE OR SMALL, WHILE NOT SHOWING EXCESSIVE STRAIN IN ACCOMPLISHING THESE AIMS.  DIRECT OR INDIRECT REFERENCES TO SOVIET UNION SHOULD BE OMITTED FROM ALL TOASTS AND PUBLIC STATEMENTS ALTHOUGH CEAUSESCU MAY WELL REFER TO SOVIETS FRANKLY ENOUGH    SECRET  IN PRIVATE CONVERSATIONS.  ROMANIANS WILL ALSO BE EXTREMELY SENSITIVE TOWARD ANY ""TALKING DOWN"" BY SUPER-POWER, AND THIS SHOULD BE AVOIDED ALTHOUGH WE SHOULD NOT GO TOO FAR IN OTHER DIRECTION EITHER OF BEING APOLOGETIC OF OUR POWER AND ROLE ON WORLD SCENE.  IN FACT, HUMOROUS REMINDER WOULD NOT BE OUT OF PLACE IN A TOAST AT SOME POINT THAT GREAT POWERS IN GENERAL AND US IN PARTICULAR ALSO HAVE ROLE TO PLAY ON INTERNATIONAL SCENE.  IF CEAUSESCU REMARK IS MADE AT SOME POINT ABOUT IMPORTANCE TO ROMANIA OF PRINCIPLE OF SOVEREIGNTY, AS SEEMS WEIKELY, IT MIGHT BE WELL TO NOTE THAT WE ALSO ATTACH IMPORTANCE TO SOVEREIGNTY--NOT ONLY FOR ROMANIA BUT FOR OURSELVES (A POINT THAT ROMANIANS SOMETIMES FORGET BECAUSE OF OBCESSION WITH THEIR OWN SITUATION).\n3.  AS DURING RECENT MEETING WITH STEIN, CEAUSESCU WILL PLACE MUCH WEIGHT ON BILATERAL ECONOMIC MATTERS OF MFN AND ENCOURAGEMENT OF JOINT VENTURES AND MAY WELL MAKE SPECIAL PITCH FOR SEEKING SEPARATE BILL TO SECURE MFN FOR ROMANIA ALONE.  THERE WILL ALSO BE MUCH EMPHASIS ON ROMANIAS CONSIDERING HERSELF AS DEVELOPING COUNTRY ENTITLED TO\n4.  PROGRAM AND ITINERARY: IT IS PROBABLY TOO EARLY TO OFFER VERY CONCRETE IDEAS ON THIS.  HOWEVER, IN CONSIDERING ANY TOUR OUTSIDE WASHINGTON AND NEW YORK, FOLLOWING AREAS HAVE SPECIAL POINTS OF INTEREST: SEATTLE (BOEING CONTRACT AND FACT THAT ONE OF THREE 707S TO BE DELIVERED TO GOR NEXT YEAR IS TO HAVE VIP CONFIGURATION; THERE ARE ALSO TWO ROMANIAN PROFESSORS IN AREA, INCIDENTALLY); MINNEAPOLIS (FIRST US-ROMANIAN JOINT VENTURE WITH CONTROL DATA CORPORATION PLUS ACTIVE WORLD AFFAIRS COUNCIL) AND AKRON-    SECRET  CLEVELAND AREA (MAJOR GOR COOPERATION WITH GENERAL TIRE PLUS LOCI OF ROMANIAN EMIGRATION IN CLEVELAND AREA--WHICH HAS SECURITY MINUSES AS WELL AS PR PLUSSES, OF COURSE.)  DURING NEW YORK VISIT, WE SHOULD ENCOURAGE STOP AT ROMANIAN LIBRARY SINCE HIGH-LEVEL IDENTIFICATION WITH THAT INSTITUTION TENDS TO REINFORCE POSITION OF OUR OWN LIBRARY HERE--OR CAN BE MADE TO DO SO.  APPEARANCE AT COUNCIL ON FOREIGN RELATIONS OR FOREIGN POLICY ASSOCIATION WAS USEFUL LAST TIME AND WOULD BE SO AGAIN AS WOULD APPEARANCE ON TELEVISION PROGRAM LIKE MEET THE PRESS.\n5.  MORE DETAILED THOUGHTS ON TOASTS, ETC.:  REFERENCES TO ROMANIAN FIGURES OR EVENTS BASED ON AT LEAST SOME KNOWLEDGE OF BACKGROUND WOULD OCCASIONALLY BE USEFUL IF NOT OVERDONE. FOR EXAMPLE, AERONAUTICAL PIONEER HENRI COANDA, ""FATHER OF THE JET ENGINE"" AND PERSON WELL-TRAVELED IN FRANCE AND--WE BELIEVE--THE US, DIED NOVEMBER 26 LAST YEAR.  ROMANIAN MEDIA ARE FILLED THESE DAYS WITH THEMATIC MATERIAL ON TRICENTENNIAL OF BIRTH OF GREAT RUMANIAN--AND EUROPEAN--CARTOGRAPHER AND ALL-AROUND INTELLECTUAL, DIMITRIE CANTEMIR; NOVEMBER IS ALSO ANNIVERSARY OF FAMOUS TIME IN ROMANIAN HISTORY (1599) WHEN MICHAEL THE BRAVE (MIHAI VITEAZUL) FIRST ACCOMPLISHED UNIFICATION OF ROMANIA, HOWEVER BRIEFLY, AND THIS IS FIGURE TO WHOM CEAUSESCU PERSONALLY ENJOYS BEING LIKENED.  NONE OF ABOVE ARE COMMUNIST-ASSOCIATED BUT ALL STRIKE CHORD OF ROMANIAN NATIONALISM.\n6.  COMMUNIQUE ON JOINT SOLEMN DECLARATION:  ROMANIANS HAVE BEEN USING STATE VISITS TO BUILD COLLECTION OF ""SOLEMN JOINT\n7.  FAMILY AND PARTY:  WE ASSUME CEAUSESCUS WIFE WILL ACCOMPANY HIM AND HOPE CONSIDERATION CAN BE GIVEN TO APPROPRIATE SIDE PROGRAM (WE RECALL HER ELECTION TO NY ACADEMY OF SCIENCES EARLIER THIS YEAR AS ONE POSSIBLE PEG); HER SUPPOSED SEPARATE QUALIFICATIONS AS A CHEMICAL ENGINEER MIGHT BE CATERED TO BY ARRANGING FOR HER TO MEET SOME PROFESSIONAL PEOPLE IN THIS AREA.  IT IS ALSO POSSIBLE THAT SON NICU OR DAUGHTER ZOE MAY ACCOMPANY AND, IF SO, COULD BE GIVEN SOME MEETINGS WITH YOUTH GROUPS (NICU IS NOW A COMMUNIST YOUTH UNION OFFICIAL), ESPECIALLY IF AMERICAN GROUPS ARE APPROPRIATELY BRIEFED.  PROGRAMMING OF OTHER OFFICIALS NEED NOT BE DISCUSSED NOW ALTHOUGH WE WOULD EXPECT TO SEE SEVERAL ECONOMIC MINISTERS AND PRESIDENTIAL COUNSELLORS ALONG INADDITION TO FOREIGN MIN MACOVESCU.\n8.  CONGRESS:  SOME SUCH MEETINGS HIGHLY DESIRABLE AS BEFORE, PERHAPS UTIBWZING PROPLE LIKE SENATORS SCOTT AND MCGEE WHO HAVE BEEN TO ROMANIA (JACKSON AND HARTKE WERE ALSO HERE AMONG OTHERS AND MFN MIGHT BE HELPED BY SUCH MEETINGS).\n9.  ISSUES TO BRING UP.  WE ARE PREPARING REVISED ""DIVIDED FAMILIES"" UPDATE AND WILL POUCH TO EUR/EE NEXT WEEK. DOLLAR BONDS IS ANOTHER PERENNIAL WORTH MENTIONING IN PRIVATE CONVERSATIONS ALTHOUGH IT NEED NOT BE OVERDONE. DEQARTMENT MAY ALSO WISH TO CONSULT EX-IM BANK AS TO UTILITY OF PLUGGING FOR BETTER PROVISION OF REQUIRED GOR ECONOMIC DATA.\n0.  USIA AND MEDIA COVERAGE WILL BE SUBJECT SEPTEL. MARTENS\n",1188122

I THINK YOU HAVE RECEIVED A COPY JOE MENTIONED OF THE JOINT STATEMENT, WHICH IS SORT OF A  SUMMARY OF THE MINUTES AND A RECORD OF WHO-ALL WAS INVOLVED. AND ALSO OF THE PEOPLE SEEN BY MEMBERS OF OUR DELEGATION IN  ADDITION TO THOSE WHO WERE OFFICIALLY MEMBERS OF THE COMMISSION SO THAT YOU GET AN IDEA OF THE SCOPE OF THE ACTIVITIES OF THE AMERICAN DELEGATION HERE. I WONT TRY TO SUMMARIZE ALL OF  THAT BUT WILL GO IMMEDIATELY TO YOUR QUESTIONS. Q. MR. SHULTZ, YOU SPENT FOUR HOURS APPROXIMATELY WITH SENIOR SOVIET LEADERS AND WE KNOW ABSOLUTELY NOTHING ABOUT WHAT PASSED. CAN YOU GIVE US ANY HINT OF WHAT YOU TALKED ABOUT AND WHAT...? A. WELL, THE DISCUSSIONS WERE ON MONDAY EVENING WITH GENERAL  SECRETARY BREZHNEV , AND ON TUESDAY AFTERNOON WITH CHAIRMAN KOSYGIN AND I WOULD SAY THAT THERE WAS SOME OVERLAP BETWEEN THE TWO AND BOTH, OF COURSE, DWELT ON THE PROBLEMS OF ECONOMICIES AND TRADE. THERE WAS ALSO DISCUSSION, PARTICULARLY WITH KOSYGIN AND SOME OTHER SOVIET OFFICIALS. THEY WERE INTERESTED IN THE EVENTS IN NAIROBI, THE INTERNATIONAL MONETARY DEVELOP- MENT, THINGS OF THAT KIND. SO WE HAD A SORT OF GENERAL DIS- CUSSION OF WORLD ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, AND OF  COURSE A GREAT VARIETY OF ASPECTS OF THOSE THINGS THAT AFFECT THE RELATION- SHIP ON ECONOMICS AND TRADE BETWEEN THE TWO COUNTIRES. CERTAINLY THE QUESTION OF OUR PRESENT DISCRIMINATORY TARIFFS AGAINST SOVIET GOODS WAS RAISED AND WE DISCUSSED THAT  PROBLEM THAT REPRESENTS ONE OF THE PROBLEMS THAT WE HAVE WHICH WE WANT TO RESOLVE THAT CAME UP AS WELL AS OTHER ISSUES. Q. MR. SECRETARY, CAN YOU TELL US HOW THEY REACTED TO THE LIKEHOOD THAT CONGRESS THIS YEAR IS GOING TO BLOCK AGAIN THE MFN? A. WELL, AS I HAVE SAID TO MY PEOPLE, INCLUDING THEM, IT IS DIFFICULT TO PREDICT EXACTLY WHEN, LET ALONE EACTLY WHAT, THE UNCLASSIFIED  CONGRESS WILL TAKE ACTION ON. ON ALMOST ANY MATTER CONGRESS OPEATES ON ITS OWN TERMS AND I WOULDNT PREDICT THAT THERE WILL BE DIFINITIVE ACTION DURING THIS YEAR NOR I WOULDNT  SAY THAT THERE WONT BE, SO IT WOULDNT PREDICT THAT, I KNOW THAT MY EXPECTATION IS THAT TRADE BILL WILL BE BROUGHT OUT ONTO THE HOUSE FLOOR PROBABLY SOMETIME IN OCTOBER AND I WOULD EXPECT THAT IT WILL NOT FINALLY BE VOTED IN TERMS OF A  CONFERENCEABLE BILL UNTIL SOMETIME PERHAPS IN FEBRUARY OR IN  THE SPRING SOMETIME OR SOMETHING ON THAT ORDER. NOW WHAT IT WILL CONTAIN IN TERMS OF THE MOST-FAVORED NATION OR THE PROBLEM OF DISCRIMINATION IN TARIFFS AGAINST SOVIET GOODS AND THE GOODS OF  OTHER NON- MARKET ECONOMIES REMAINS TO BE SEEN AND THE PRESI- DENTS POSITION ON THAT, WHICH I CERTAINLY SUPPORT, IS THAT WE SHOULD HAVE AUTHORITY, EITHER IN THAT BILL OR SEPARATELY TO GRANT THIS CONDITION WHICH WE GRANT TO OTHER  COUNTIRES WITH WHOM WE HAVE SUBSTANTIAL TRADE. Q. MR. SHULTZ, WHAT WAS... REACTION TO THE POINT YOU JUST MADE, THAT YOU WERENT SURE WHAT WAS GING TO HAPPEN, WHAT WAS THEIR REACTION WHEN YOU SPELLED THAT OUT TO THEM? A. WELL, I THINK THAT YOU HAVE TO ASK THE MEMBERS OF THE SOVIET DELEGATION FOR THEIR REACTION, THEY WILL SPEAK FOR  THEMSELVES. I ALWAYS FIND IT A BAD PRACTICE TO TRY TO SPEAK FOR OTHER PEOPLE. I CAN SPEAK FOR MYSELF TO A DEGREE, AND IF IAM LUCKY, FOR THE ADMINISTRATION. (LAUGHTER), BUT I WOULDNT  WANT TO SPEAK FOR THEM. Q. MR SHULTZ, WE KNOW THAT THE FINAL SETTLEMENT ON THE LEND- LEASE BILL IS BEING HELD UP BY THE ACTION IN CONGRESS ON THE MFN. ARE ANY OTHER ELEMENTS OF THE TRADE PACKAGE WITH THE SOVIETS BEING BLOCKED BECAUSE CONGRESS HASNT PASSED MFN? A. WELL, THE WHOLE AGREEMENT, AS I UNDERSTAND IT, CANT  COME INTO BEING LITERALLY UNITL THE VARIOUS CONDITIONS ARE SATISFIED AND THE LEND-LEASE PART IS ONE OF THE PARTS THAT HAS MONEY CONNECTED WITH IT THAT IS OBVIOUSLY HELD UNTIL ALL PARTS OF THE BARGAIN, INCLUDING THE MFN PART, CAN BE GRANTED. OF COURSE, WE HAVE SEEN A VERY SUBSTANTIAL INCREASE IN TRADE OVER THE PAST THREE YEARS FROM TOTAL TURNOVER OF ABOUT DOLLS. 200 MILLION IN 1971 TO ABOUT DOLS. 600 MILLION OR A LITTLE OVER\n",1187913

THE SUMMARY REPORT REQUIRED IN A-9166 COVERING THE SUBJECT EXHIBIT FOLLOWS: A. NAME OF EXHIBITION: TEXTILE MACHINERY AND APPAREL MANUFACTURING CATALOG SHOW B. PLACE AND DATE: AUDITORIUM, USIS LIBRARY, LIKE YEW BUILDING, KUALA LUMPUR, SEP 24-28, 1973 C. NUMBER OF FIRMS SUPPLYING CATALOGS: 61 D. NUMBER OF VISITORS: (1) REGISTERED: 21 (2) TOTAL: 90 E. NUMBER OF TRADE ENQUIRIES DEVELOPED (CATALGOS REQUESTED): 108 F. NUMBER OF EXHIBITING FIRMS RECEIVING TRADE INQUIRIES: 41\n2. COMMENTS: A. ALTHOUGH THE NUMBER OF VISITORS TO THIS EXHIBITION DID NOT REACH THAT ANTICIPATED BY THE EMBASSY, THE QUALITY AND INTEREST OF THOSE ATTENDING ACCORDING TO MR.  JACKSON, WERE TO BE CONSIDERED QUOTE BLUE RIBBON UNQUOTE. CERTAINLY IN NUMBERS, KUALA LUMPURS SHOW RANKED BELOW UNCLASSIFIED  MUHILA AND BANGKOK; HOWEVER, THE TEXTILE INDUSTRY HERE IS VERY SMALL, WHILE GARMENT MAKING IS MOSTLY IN THE HANDS OF SMALL ENTREPRENEURS WITH A HANDFUL OF EMPLOYEES WORKING IN SHOPHOUSES. BUT GIVEN THE POTENTIAL GROWTH IN BOTH SECTORS IN SOUTH EAST ASIA, AND THE GROWING INTEREST IN MALAYSIA IN INVESTMENT IN BOTH TEXTILE AND GARMENT MAKING, THE TIMING OF THE EXHIBITION WAS WELL CHOSEN. B. FOLLOWING DISCUSSIONS WITH MR. JACKSON, MR. LOH SIEW LUN, CHAIRMAN OF THE GARMENT MANUFACTURERS ASSOCIATION OF THE STATES OF MALAYA, STATED THAT HIS ASSOCIATION WOULD GIVE STRONG CONSIDERATION TO SENDING A PURCHASING MISSION TO THE UNITED STATES. HE ASKED FOR, AND WAS GIVEN, ALL OF THE GARMENT- MAKING EQUIPMENT CATALOGS FOLLOWING THE SHOW. THESE CATALOGS WILL BE MADE AVAILABLE TO THE MORE THAN 100 MEMBERS OF THE ASSOCIATION. THE CATALOGS ON THE TEXTILE MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT WILL BE GIVEN, ON REQUEST, TO THE ENGINEERING DEPARTMENT OF MALAYSIAN INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT FINANCE, A QUASI-GOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATION, WHOSE INDUSTRIAL CONSULTANTS ARE CURRENTLY WORKING ON A PROJECT TO IMPLEMENT INVESTMENT IN TEXTILE INDUSTRIES IN MALAYSIA. THEREFORE THE CATALOGS WILL FIND ADDITIONAL USE THROUGH THESE MULTIPLIERS. C. THE EMBASSY DECIDED TO HOLD THE EXHIBITION AT THE USIS DOWNTOWN FACILITY AFTER BEING INFORMED OF THE NUMBER OF CATALOGS TO BE SHOWN. THE AUDITORIUM AT THE USIS LIBRARY WAS WELL SUITED FOR THIS SHOW, TABLES WERE AVAILABLE FOR PERUSAL OF THE CATALOGS, AND GROUPS OF BUSINESSMEN COULD BE ADDRESSED READILY BY MR JACKSON. ONLY A FRACTION OF THE ORIGINAL BUDGET WAS USED FOR THIS SHOW, THE EMBASSYS COMMERCIAL SECTION SETTING IT UP AND DISMANTLING THE EXHIBIT, WITH THE STRONG ARM OF MR JACKSON WILLINGLY ASSISTING IN ASSEMBLING THE DISPLAY RACKS. SIX HUNDRED INVITATIONS WERE MAILED FOR THE SHOW; 1000 ADDITIONAL BUSINESSMEN WERE REACHED THROUGH THE EMBASSYS COMMERCIAL NEWSLETTER OF SEP 1, AND THE LOCAL PRESS PUBLISHED TWO COMPLIMENTARY INTERVIEWS WITH MR JACKSON TO HELP US PROMOTE THE EXHIBIT. (GIVEN THE ACUTE SHORTAGE OF NEWSPRINT IN MALAYSIA, WE FOUND THIS ESPECIALLY HEARTENING.) A LEADING TEXTILE INDUSTRIALIST FLEW MR JACKSON TO HIS PLANT 200 MILES NORTH OF KUALA LUMPUR, WHERE A DAY WAS SPENT IN FAMILIARIZATION WITH MALAYSIAS TEXTILE INDUSTRY. MR JACKSONS PRESENCE IN KUALA LUMPUR WAS ESPECIALLY WELCOMED BECAUSE OF HIS UNCLASSIFIED EXPERTISE AND FACILITY TO DISCUSS THE STATE-OF-TLW-ART IN THE UNITED STATES WITH FLEDGLING, INTERESTED TEXTILE MAKERS. D. WEAVING AND KNITTING MACHINES WERE OF GREATEST INTEREST, WITH PROCESSING, SPINNING AND TWISTING MACHINERY IN SECOND PLACE. MOST VISITORS WERE END-USERS, MANUFACTURERS AND ENGINEERING CONSULTANTS, WHILE POTENTIAL AGENTS WERE IN THE MINORITY. VIA TELEPHONE INQUIRY, WE WERE TOLD BY LOCAL TEXTILE MACHINERY AGENTS THAT THEY ARE BOMBARDED WITH CATALGOS BY FIRMS ALL OVER THE WORLD, AND SHOWED LITTLE INTEREST IN WHAT OUR SHOW HAD TO OFFER. THE WORLD-RENOWN SHOEMAKER, BATA SHOE, HAD A SIX-MAN DELEGATION CALL AT THE EXHIBIT, AND A TWO HOUR DISCUSSION ENSUED, COVERING VARIOUS ASPECTS OF THE USE OF FABRICS IN SHOE MANUFACTURE. E. THE EMBASSY CONTINUES TO HEARTILY ENDORSE THE USE OF THE CATALOG SHOW AS A TRADE PROMOTION TOOL IN MALAYSIA. THROUGH THE USE OF TECHNICAL SEMINARS, OR THE AVAILABILITY OF QUALIFIED EXPERTS LIKE MR. JACKSON, WE CONTRIBUTE TO THE EDUCATION OF LOCAL BUSINESSMEN, COMPLEMENTING THE SALES POTENTIAL ENGENDERED BY THE CATALOGS.\n",1202519

THE RTG HAD APPARENTLY HOPED THAT PLACING CHARGES OF COMMUNIST CONSPIRACH AND TREASON AGAINST THE GROUP WOULD STYMIE THE CONS- CONFIDENTIAL TITUTIONAL MOVEMENT. THE RTG, HOWEVER, MISCALCULATED THE DEPTH OF STUDENT FEELING AND POPULAR SUPPORT FOR THE STUDENTS. ONCE THE RTG AND THE STUDENTS ENTERED NEGOTIATIONS, QUICK, MINIMAL RTG CONCESSIONS DID NOT MATERIALIZE. INEPT AND TARDY ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE RTG OF THE SATURDAY NOON AGREEMENT FOR THE DETAINEES UNCONDITIONAL RELAESE, AND OF A CONSTITUTION BY OCTOBER 1974, RESULTED IN THE STUDENTS TAKING TO THE STREETS. BY THE TIME A SECOND AGREEMENT WAS REACHED, STUDENT LEADERS COULD NOT CONTROL ALL THE DEMONSTRATORS. ALTHOUGH SOME STUDENTS OBEYED NSCT LEADERS AND DISPERSED, ADVENTUROUS BYSTANDERS, AND UNDISCIPLINED VOCATIONAL STUDENTS REMAINED ON THE SCENE. SCUFFLING AND HOLLIGANISM DURING THE MORNING HOURS OF OCTOBER 14 DEGENERATED INTO ARMED COMBAT AGAINST RTG SECURITY FORCES AFTER STUDENT CASUALTIES ENRAGED THE RIOTERS. DESPITE APPEALS FROM STUDENT LEADERS, THE KING AND THE RTG, MOBS REFUSED TO STOP ATTACKING RTG FACILITIES. THOUGH THE EXACT CAUSE AND EFFECT RELATIONSHIPS REMAIN UNCLEAR, THE DECLINE OF VIOLENCE IN BANGKOK COINCIDED QUITE CLOSELY WITH THE PUBLIC ANNOUNCEMENT SHORTLY AFTER 1800 HOURS ON OCTOOER 15 THAT THANOM, PRAPHAT, AND NARONG ""HAD LEFT"" THAILAND. ALTHOUGH THEY HAD NOT YET ACTUALLY LEFT, THE REPORT WAS WIDELY BELIEVED AT THE TIME AND CALM DESCENDED RAPIDLY OVER OANGKOK. END SUMMARY.\n1. THE ROOTS OF STUDENT AND POPULAR DISSATISFACTION WITH THE THANOM GOVERNMENT ARE COVERED IN REF A AND OTHER EMBASSY REPORTING. THE SERIES OF EVENTS WHICH LED TO THE FALL OF PRIME MINISTER THANOM KITTIKACHORN BEGAN WITH THIRAYUDH BOONMEE, FORMER SECRETARY GENERAL OF THE NATIONAL STUDENT CENTER OF THAILAND (NSCT) ANNOUNCING THAT A POPULAR MOVEMENT TO PETITION FOR THE EARLY PROMULGATION OF A CONSTITUTION HAD BEEN ESTABLISHED. AN ORGANIZATIONAL MEETING WAS HELD IN CENTRAL BANGKOK AND A LIST OF 100 PETITIONERS, INCLUDING THANOMS YOUNGER BROTHER, A RETIRED POLICE MAJOR GENERAL AND FORMER DEPUTY FOREIGN MINISTER, WAS PUBLICLY RELEASED ON FRIDAY OCTOBER 5.\n2. ON SATURDAY, OCTOBER 6, THE POLICE ARRESTED 11 OF THE ORGANIZERS WHILE THEY WERE DISTRIBUTING PAMPHLETS AND SEARCHED THEIR ROOMS IN WHATQS OBVIOUSLY INTENDED AS A PRE-EMPTIVE STRIKE AGAINST THE MOVEMENT. INITIALLY DETAINED ON THE GROUNDS OF VIOLATING AN AN EMERGENCY REGULATION PROHIBITING PUBLIC GATHERINGS OF MORE THAN FIVE PERSONS, DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER PRAPHAT ANNOUNCED ON CONFIDENTIAL OCTOOER 9 THAT EVIDENCE HADHBEEN UNCOVERED OF A PLOT TO OVERTHROW THE GOVERNMENT. HE ANNOUNCED THAT THE GROUP WAS THEREFORE BEING HELD UNDER ARTICLE 17 WHICH PERMITS INDEFINITE DETENTION. BY THAT TIME THE NUMBER OF DETAINEES HAD RISEN TO 13 WITH THE ARREST OF ANOTHER PERSON AND SURRENDER OF FORMER MEMBER OF PARLIAMENT KHAISAENG SUKSAI.\n3. ALTHOUGH ONLY FIVE OF THE DETAINEES WERE CURRENTLY STUDENTS, UNIVERSITY STUDENTS IN THE BANGKOK AREA HELD DAY-TIME, HYDE PARK DEMONSTRATIONS SUPPORTING THE DETAINEES BEGINNING OCTOOER 7. PROFESSORS AND LECTURERS ALSO SUPPORTED THE STUDENTS VIEWS. IN UNCOMMON SOLIDARITY WITH THE STUDENTS, 117 UNIVERSITY LECTURERS SIGNED AN APPEAL ASKING FOR THE RELAESE OF THE DETAINEES. SINCE EXAMINATIONS WERE IN PROGRESS AT MOST UNIVERSITIES, HOWEVER, OBSERVERS EXPECTED THE STUDENTS TO CONCENTRATE ON THEIR STUDIES INSTEAD OF POLITICAL ACTIVISM.\n4. AFTER SOME INITIAL HESITATION THE NSCT, WHICH HAD BEEN ENGAGED IN PREPARING ITS OWN DRAFT CONSTITUTION AND HAD DEMANDED A DECEMBER 1973 PROMULGATION DATE, TOOK UP THE CAUSE OF THE DETAINEES. AS MORE AND MORE STUDENTS GATHERED AT THAMMASAT UNIVERSITY UNDER THE GUIDANCE OF THE NSCT, THE RALLIES BECAME BIGGER AND CONTINUED AROUND THE CLOCK. THE NSCT EXHIBITED GOOD DISCIPLINE AND ORGANIZATION, INCLUDING FOOD PROCUREMENT AND BASIC HEALTH FACILITIES. ALTHOUGH SOME OF THE ORATORY WAS FIERY, THE NSCT STRESSED NON-VIOLENCE AND LOYALTY TO THE KING AND THE BUDDHIST RELIGION. THE STUDENT DEMAND ENJOYED A BASIC POPULARITY WITH THE URBAN POPULACE. THE STUDENTS GOOD DEPORTMENT ELICITED GROWING SYMPATHY AND SUPPORT FROM THE BANGKOK PUBLIC, WHICH FROM THE BEGINNING HAD FREELY CONTRIBUTED MONEY AND FOOD TO THE THRONG AT THAMMASAT.\n5. CONCERNED ABOUT THE GROWING DEMONSTRATION AND THE POSS- IBILITY OF VIOLENCE, THE KING HAD AN AUDIENCE WITH THANOM AND PRAPHAT ON OCTOBER 10 TO PRESS FOR A RELAXATION OF THE RTG HARD LINE AND A COMPROMISE WITH THE STUDENTS FOR THE RELEASE OF THE DETAINEES.\n6.ON THURSDAY, OCTOBER 11, THE GOVERNMENT RELEASED FURTHER INFORMATION ABOUT THE DOCUMENTS SEIZED AS EVIDENCE THAT THE ACCUSED HAD COMMUNIST CONNECTIONS, BUT THIS CONFIDENTIAL PRESENTATION WAS UNCONVINCING TO THE PUBLIC AND TO MOST INFORMED OBSERVERS. PRAPHAT MET WITH THE STUDENT LEADERS IN AN UNPRODUCTIVE SESSION. IN A PRESS INTERVIEW, HOWEVER, HE OFFERED A CONSTITUTION IN 20 MONTHS. STUDENT RANKS AT THAMMASAT UNI- VERSITY SWELLED AND AN ESTIMATED 20,000 REMAINED THROUGH THE NIGHT. ON FRIDAY MORNING THE UNIVERSITY STUDENTS WERE JOINED BY GROUPS OF TECHNICAL STUDENTS WITH A REPUTATION FOR HOOLIGANISM, WHO OFFERED TO ACT AS ""SHOCK TROOPS"" AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT. DEMONSTRATORS NOW NUMBERED 40 TO 50 THOUSAND.\n7. ON FRIDAY NOON, OCTOBER 12, THE NSCT PUBLICLY ANNOUNCED THAT IT HAD PRESENTED PRAPHAT WITH AN ULTIMATUM: UNCONDITIONAL RELEASE OF THE 13 DETAINEES WITHIN 24 HOURS, OR THE NSCT WOULD CONSIDER TAKING DRASTIC ACTION. AFTER INTENSIVE CONSULTATIONS, THE GOVERNMENT THAT EVENING OFFERED TO RELEASE 12 OF THE DE- TAINEES, EXLUDING KHAISAENG, ON BAIL. THE NSCT EVENTUALLY RE- JECTED THE OFFER BECAUSE IT ALLOWED THE CHARGES OF TREASON TO STAND. NEVERTHELESS A DONOR CAME FORWARD WITH THE BAIL, AND THE POLICE THREW THE DETAINEES OUT OF JAIL AT NOON ON OCTOBER 13 IN THE NAIVE BELIEF THAT THE CONSEQUENCES OF THE NSCT ULTIMATUM COULD BE AVOIDED . THE NSCT LEADERS INDEED STUCK TO THEIR DEMAND THAT THE TREASON CHARGES BE DROPPED.\n8. SHORTLY AFTER THE NOON DEADLINE, PRAPHAT, NOW TRYING TO HEAD OFF A CONFRONTATION, MET WITH THE NSCT LEADERS AND OFFERED THE UNCONDITIONAL RELEASE OF THE 13 DETAINEES AND THE PROMULGATION OF A NEW CONSTITUTION WITHIN 13 MONTHS. THE STUDENT LEADERS SIGNED AN AGREEMENT WITH PRAPHAT AND RETURNED TO RELATE THE TERMS TO THEIR COLLEAGUES. HOWEVER, THE LATE HOUR OF THESE NEGOTIATIONS AND THE LACK OF AN IMMEDIATE PUBLIC ANNOUNCEMENT MEANT THAT SOME\n9. IN THE LATE AFTERNOON, HOWEVER, THE NSCT LEADERSHIP BEGAN TO RUN INTO PROBLEMS OF CROWD CONTROL AND COMMUNICATION. THE PROBLEMS WERE COMPLICATED BY A GOVERNMENT DESCRIPTION OF THE NOON MEETING, NOT BROADCAST UNTIL 1630, WHICH SAID THAT THE NSCT LEADERS WHO MET CONFIDENTIAL WITH PRAPHAT ASKED FOR THE RELEASE OF THE 13 DETAINEES. THE BROAD- CAST QUOTED PRAPHAT AS AGREEING TO A COMPROMISE ON THE CONDITION THAT THE STUDENTS ""COMPLETELY DISBAND THE DEMONSTRATION AND DROP ALL PRESENT DEMANDS."" NO MENTION WAS MADE OF THE CONSTITUTION. STUDENT LEADERS APPARENTLH REGARDED THIS ANNOUNCEMENT AS A SIGN OF RTG BREACH OF TRUST. PART OF THE DEMONSTRATORS BEGAN MARCHING TOWARD GOVERNMENT HOUSE AT 1730. MEANWHILE, NSCT LEADERS MET WITH THE KING, AND AROUND\n0. SOME OF THE DEMONSTRATORS OBEYED NSCT APEALS AND DISPERSED. VARIOUS FACTORS PROBABLY MOTIVATED THE REMAINING DEMONSTRATORS TO CROWD THE STREETS AROUND THE DEMOCRACY MONUMENT. MANY EVIDENTLY STILL MISTRUSTED THE GOVERNMENTS PROMISES. ACTIVIST LEADERS APPARENTLY RAISED THE DEMAND FOR FURTHER GOVERNMENT CONCESSIONS, INCLUDING THE RESIGNATION OF PRAPHAT AND/OR THANOM. OTHERS MAY HAVE STAYED OUT FOR THE ADVENTURE, FOR THE MOONLIGHT, OR FOR THE OPPORTUNITY FOR MISCHIEF, SINCE ISOLATED INCIDENTS OF VANDALISM WERE REPORTED DURING THE NIGHT. POLICE ON HAND WERE UNDER ORDERS NOT TO INTERFERE AND THEY ACTED WITH DISCRETION THROUGH SATURDAY NIGHT.\n1. EARLY SUNDAY MORNING VIOLENCE APPEARED FOR THE FIRST TIME IN WIDELY SCATTERED AREAS. NEAR THE ROYAL PALACE STRAGGLERS CONFRONTED EXHAUSTED POLICE AT APPROXIMATELY 0600. TEAR GAS WAS USED, AND THERE ARE REPORTS THAT SOME SHOTS WERE HEARD, BUT WE CANNOT CON- FIRM WHETHER THERE WERE ANY SERIOUS INJURIES, BUT THE DEPUTY MINISTER OF DEFENSE TOLD US OCTOBER 17 THAT ONE STUDENT WAS KILLED AS STUDENTS TRIED TO SCALE THE PALACE WALL TO AVOID TEAR GAS. MEANWHILE NEAR THAMMASAT UNIVERSITY, A GROUP OF HOOLIGANS ENTERED THE PUBLIC RELATIONS DEPARTMENT BUILDING, BREAKING WINDOWS AND RANSACKING FILES AROUND 0800. AN ADJACENT POLICE STATION WAS THREATENED BY THE MOB; SHOOTING BROKE OUT AND THE POLICE CALLED FOR REINFORCEMENTS. MEANWHILE, RIGHTLY OR WRONGLY, WORD SPREAD LIKE WILDFIRE THAT A STUDENT HAD BEEN KILLED. CONFIDENTIAL 12. IT IS UNCLEAR WHETHER THERE WERE ARMS IN THE CROWD AT THIS TIME; WE SUSPECT THERE MAY HAVE BEEN A FEW WEAPONS AMONG THE ROUGHER ELEMENTS, PERHAPS ZIP GUNS. IT IS ALSO UNCLEAR WHO FIRED FIRST; WE SUSPECT THAT THE POLICE MAY HAVE FIRED WARNING SHOTS IN THE AIR AS THE MOB THREATENED TO OVERWHELM THE STATION. THIS PERHAPS DREW SOME RETURN FIRE FROM ZIP GUNS IN THE CROWD. REALIZING THEY WERE BEING SHOT AT, THE POLICE IN DESPERATION MAY HAVE STARTED FIRING INTO THE CROWD.\n3. WHEN ARMY TROOPS AND SOME TANKS CAME BEFORE NOON THEY REPORTEDLY INITIALLY FIRED WARNING SHOTS IN THE AIR. SOME TROOPS MAY HAVE BEEN HIT BY STUDENTS GUNS, OR POSSIBLY EVEN BY STRAY BULLETS COMING FROM THE BESIEGED POLICE STATION, IN FRONT AND TO THE LEFT OF WHERE THEY WERE DEPLOYED. THE TROOPS PANICKED AND STARTED FIRING INTO THE CROWD CAUSING SIGNIFICANT CASUALTIES AND INFLAMING MOB HYSTERIA. BY MID-AFTERNOON THE POLICE STATION WAS ABANDONED, THE POLICE AND MILITARY TROOPS HAD WITHDRAWN FROM THE DEMOCRACY MONUMENT AREA, A GROUP OF STUDENTS HAD LAID SIEGE TO THE METROPOLITAN POLICE HEADQUARTERS NEARBY, WHILE THE NATIONAL LOTTERY, REVENUE DEPARTMENT AND BIFGO BUILDINGS WERE IN FLAMES. DESPITE APPEALS THERE NOW WAS NO REASONING WITH THE INFLAMED MOB.\n4. AS BEST AS WE CAN TELL ARMY AND POLICE ELEMENTS INFLICTED MOST OF THE CASUALTIES BETWEEN 1000 AND 1600 ON STUDENTS AND RIOTERS AROUND THAMMASAT UNIVERSITY, THE PRAMANE GROUNDS AND THE ROYAL HOTEL. THE POLICE TOOK THE BRUNT OF THE RIOTERS ATTACKS. INNOCENT STUDENTS UNDER THE NSCT BECAME INVOLVED IN THE CONFLAGRATION BECAUSE THEY WERE TRAPPED IN THE THAMMASAT CAMPUS WHERE THEY HAD SPENT THE NIGHT SLEEPING OFF SATURDAYS WEARINESS.\n5. WHILE THE SEQUENCE OF MOVES IS UNCLEAR, IT APPEARS THAT THE KING AGAIN INTERVENED ON THE AFTERNOON OF OCTOBER 14 TO SUGGEST TO THANOM THAT HE SHOULD RESIGN AS PRIME MINISTER IN ORDER TO RESTORE ORDER; ANNOUNCEMENT WAS MADE BY RADIO AND TV AT SUNSET THAT THE GOVERNMENT HAD RESIGNED AND THAT THE KING HAD NAMED RESPECTED JUDGE AND THAMMASAT UNIVERSITY RECTOR DR. SANYA, AS THE NEW CIVILIAN PRIME MINISTER. EFFORTS TO PASS THIS WORD TO THE MOBS FAILED TO CLEAR THE STREETS; LATER IN THE EVENING, IN AN UNPRECEDENTED MOVE, THE KING HIMSELF MADE A TELEVISION APPEAL. PRIME MINISTER SANYA ALSO TOOK TO THE AIR WAVES TO RE- CONFIDENTIAL ASSURE THE PEOPLE AND CALL FOR AN END TO THE DISTURBANCES. SANYA PROMISED A NEW CONSTITUTION WITHIN SIX MONTHS, EARLY POPULAR ELECTIONS, AND ORDERED GOVERNMENT OFFICES IN BANGKOK CLOSED FOR THREE DAYS.\n6. AFTER MIDNIGHT FIELD MARSHAL THANOM, EXERCISING HIS PRE- ROGATIVE AS SUPREME COMMANDER, A POST WHICH HEHAD APPARENTLY RETAINEDN BROADCAST A HARD-LINE MESSAGE ORDERING DRASTIC MEASURES TO END THE VIOLENCE AND ATTACKS ON GOVERNMENT BUILDINGS. WILDER ELEMENTS FROM THE MOB HAD OBTAINED WEAPONS, FROM LOOTING GUN SHOPS AS WELL AS FROM THE OVERRUN POLICE STATION, AND CONTINUED THEIR SIEGE OF METROPOLITAN POLICE HEADQUARTERS. POLICE THERE RETURNED THE FIRE DURING THE MORNING HOURS, BUT WERE NOT REINFORCED; IN EARLY AFTERNOON ON OCTOBER 15 THE LAST POLICE ABANDONED THE HEADQUARTERS BUILDING, WHICH WAS THEN SET AFIRE BY THE ATTACKERS.\n7.  THE BURNING OF METROPOLITAN POLICE HEADQUARTERS MARKED THE END OF MAJOR VIOLENCE IN THE CITY; HAVING SPENT THEIR FURY THE RIOTERS DID NOT MOVE ON TO NEW TARGETS. BANGKOK, HOWEVER, WAS STILL FILLED WITH GROUPS OF YOUNG PEOPLE ON THE MARCH. POLICE AND MILITARY REMAINED LARGELY OUT OF SIGHT; GOVERN- MENT OFFICES, BANKS AND MOST SHOPS WERE CLOSED. STUDENTS COMMANDEERED BUSES TO MOVE AIMLESSLY ABOUT THE STREETS CHEERING AND CELEBRATING. RUMORS WERE RIFE AND THE GENERAL PUBLIC WAS VERY UNEARY.\n8. LATE IN THE AFTERNOON OF OCTOBER 15 THE KING AND HIS NEW PRIME MINISTER EVIDENTLY DETERMINED THAT ONLY THE DEPARTURE OF THANOM, PRAPHAT, AND COLONEL NARONG WOULD RESOLVE THE CRISIS. THANOM AND PRAPHAT MAY ALSO HAVE REALIZED THAT THEY COULD NOT STAY ON WITHOUT ORDERING DRACONIAN MEASURES AND GENUINELY SHRANK FROM DOING VIOLENCE TO LARGE NUMBERS OF THEIR FELLOW THAI. THEY WERE ALSO PROBABLY FEARFUL OF THEIR OWN SAFETY. THEY MADE ARRANGEMENTS TO LEAVE. IN ANY CASE, BEGINNING SHORTLY AFTER 6 P.M. ANNOUNCEMENTS WERE BROADCAST THAT THEY HAD LEFT THE COUNTRY. PRAPHAT AND NARONG ACTUALLY LEFT THAT NIGHT AT 9:45 P.M. FOR TAIPEI. THANOM STAYED IN ABSOLUTE SECLUSION FOR 24 HOURS AND LEFT FOR THE U.S., REPORTEDLY TO BOSTON.\n9. THE ANNOUNCEMENT OF THANOMS AND PRAPHATS DEPARTURES HAD A CONFIDENTIAL MAGICAL EFFECT ON THE MASSES OF YOUNG PEOPLE IN THE STREETS. THE KINGS MOTHER AND THE BUDDHIST SUPREME PATRIARCH APPEALED FOR ORDER. THE NEW PRIME MINISTER APPEARED ON TELEVISION. THE STUDENT LEADERS ALSO MADE THEIR TV SPEECHES AND ANNOUNCED THAT THE MALE LEADERS WERE GOING INTO THE BUDDHIST MONKHOOD FOR A PERIOD. DESPITE THE LACK OF NORMAL POLICE SECURITY, IT WAS A CALM NIGHT IN BANGKOK AND THE PEOPLE OF THAILAND AWOKE ON THE MORNING OF OCTOBER 16 WITH AN APPARENT SENSE OF HAPPY RELIEF AT THE DAWN OF A NEW ERA. THROUGHOUT THE EVENTS RECOUNTED ABOVE THERE WAS SYMPATHY AND SUPPORT FOR THE NSCT BY THE GENERAL POPULACE, WHICH WAS MANIFESTED BY GIFTS OF MONEH AND FOOD AS WELL AS VOCAL ENCOURAGEMENT. AT ITS CONCLUSION, AND DESPITE SHOCK OVER THE DEATHS THEN BELIEVED TO TOTAL ABOUT 300, THERE WAS A SENSE OF EUPHROIA AMONG A MAJORITY OF THE PUBLIC, A FEELING THAT FOR THE FIRST TIME IN THAILAND THE PEOPLE HAD EXERCISED POLITICAL POWER AND THAT A NEW DAY HAD DAWNED IN THEIR HISTORY.\n0.A FINAL COUNT OF THE TOTAL NUMBER KILLED ON BOTH SIDES IS NOT YET IN, BUT IT SEEMS THAT IT WILL BE BETWEEN 50 AND\n0.\n1. IT IS NOT POSSIBLE AT THIS TIME TO IDENTIFY ANY ORGANIZED COMMUNIST OR FOREIGN INVOLVEMENT IN THE VIOLENT ASPECTS OF THE CRISIS. SOME OF THE ACTIVIST STUDENTS WERE POLITICAL RADICALS, BUT WE HAVE NO CLEAR EVIDENCE AS YET OF TIES TO THE COMMUNIST PARTY OF THAILAND OR OTHER ORGANIZED MOVEMENT. THE ATTEMPTS BY THE THANOM GOVERNMENT FROM THE OEGINNING TO CATEGORIZE ALL THE PROTESTORS, INCLUDING RECOGNIZED STUDENT MODERATES, AS PART OF A COMMUNIST CONSPIRACY WAS, IN FACT, AN IMPORTANT ELEMENT IN INFLAMING STUDENT OPINION AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT.

10,0.7222954897716006,5368 Subj: Husseins Views1 Have just returned from meeting with King held in armys war room where                        Jordanian military and civilian leaders congregating They are sleepless and                        living on cigarettes and coffee King himself said he felt incoherent This psychological                        atmosphere must be considered as we look at what he has to say2 First he thinks that the Syrians are going to get a pasting I said I                        agreed as it seemed to me that the Israelis will concentrate first on that                        front that their mobilization is complete and that we may see a different                        story on the Golan than we had had up to now What disturbs him the most is                        that the Israelis will not be content to drive the Syrians back to the                        ceasefire line but will want to pursue and destroy even if this takes them                        to Damascus Of first importance he believes is get point across to                        Israelis that this is unacceptable Here he thinks big powers especially                        US have major responsibility A largescale Israeli invasion of Syria he                        warns could drag Jordan in willynilly2 Second and this is related Israel must stop its constant overflying of                        Jordan Today 64 Israeli planes used Mafraq airbase as a homing area for                        repeated attacks at Syrian targets His air force stood on the ground and                        his pilots feel increasingly humiliated Israeli planes have constantly and                        continuously violated Jordan air space on their forays to and from Syria but                        Mafraq action is a step up over casual passage4 Third the Security Council must act and promptly It cannot simply be a                        call for all parties to return to their original positions A                        straightforward simple demand for a ceasefire is what is needed To it                        should be coupled something which will relaunch negotiations He hopes it                        will come tonight and not drag onAn October 8                            memorandum to Kissinger reported                            Rifais statement that political pressures on Jordan to intervene in the                            current Middle East crisis were reaching an intolerable level and that                            although Jordan could stall for a day or two the King could not                            maintain this position indefinitely Also this position probably could                            not be maintained if the military situation should change

SUMMARY: AVAILABLE EVIDENCE STILL SUGGESTS HUSSEIN WILL ATTEMPT TO REMAIN ON SIDELINES. HOWEVER, PRESSURES FOR JORDANIAN COMMITMENT COULD ERUPT QUICKLY FROM NUMBER OF    SECRET  DIRECTIONS. LATEST (AND UNEXPECTED) FACTOR WORKING AGAINST JORDANIAN MODERATION IS REPORTED ISRAELI OVERFLIGHT OF AMMAN SUBURBS NOON OCT 7. END SUMMARY\n2. WE HAVE BEEN GIVING CONSIDERABLE THOUGHT TO HUSSEINS\n3. MAIN FACTOR FOR CONSIDERATION IS TIME-FRAME. IF FIGHTING CAN BE HALTED WITHIN FEW DAYS, HUSSEIN WILL HAVE FAIRLY EASY TIME STAYING OUT. HE UNDOUBTEDLY IS HOPING FOR THIS EARLY RE- PRIEVE. HOWEVER, PRESSURES WILL INCREASE RAPIDLY IF BATTLE BE- COMES PROTRACTED. TIME ALSO WILL DICTATE THE TYPE OF PRESSURES HE MUST FACE. FOR EXAMPLE, AVAILABLE EVIDENCE SUGGESTS COMM- AND LEVEL OFFICERS IN JORDAN ARMY AT PRESENT MOMENT ARE NO MORE ANXIOUS THAN BEFORE TO JOIN ANY BATTLE THEY ARE UNSURE OF WINNING HOWEVER, IN UNLIKELY EVENT OF ARAB ""STEAMROLLER"" SUCCESS AGAINST ISRAELIS, THIS ATTITUDE LIKELY TO SHIFT TO AGITATION TO JOIN  FRAY. KING, DEPENDING ON ARMY AS POWER BASE AND MINDFUL OF ROLE AS OUSTED SOVEREIGN OF WEST BANK, WOULD FIND IT DIFFICULT TO  FORFEIT THIS CHANCE TO RECOVER SOME OF OCCUPIED TERRITORIES. MORE REALISTIC SITUATION WOULD INVOLVE TURN OF TIDE IN ISRAELI FAVOR AND RESULTANT APPEALS FOR HELP BY SYRIANS AND EGYPTIANS. WE SUSPECT KING WOULD STALL AS LONG AS POSSIBLE, PERHAPS  HOPING FOR SECURITY COUNCIL CEASE-FIRE APPEAL OR SOME OTHER FACE- SAVING DEVICE. ON OTHER HAND, THERE ARE EMOTIONAL LIMITS, EG:  ARAB HONOR, WHICH HE WOULD EVENTUALLY REACH ESPECIALLY IF  ISRAELI COUNTER ATTACK WENT BEYOND FORMER CEASE-FIRE LINES. IF SYRIANS BECAME SUFFICIENTLY DESPERATE, THEY COULD LAUNCH SOME MOVEMENT THROUGH NORTHWEST TIP OF JORDAN THAT WOULD PROVOKE ISRAELI RESPONSE AND THUS MAKE IT VIRTUALLY IMPOSSIBLE  FOR JORDAN TO REMAIN ON SIDELINES. WE ASSUME ISRAELIS WISH TO AVOID OPENING THIRD FRONT AND WOULD AVOID SIMILAR TRANSIT OF  JORDANIAN TERRITORY, DESPITE TACTICAL ADVANTAGES OF FLANKING OPERATION IN GOLAN. RASH ISRAELI MOVE IN THIS AREA WOULD OF  COURSE LEAVE JORDAN NO CHOICE. STILL ANOTHER POSSIBILITY IS  THAT IRAQ WOULD DEMAND TRANSIT RIGHTS IN ORDER TO COMMIT ITS FORCES TO BATTLE ZONE. HUSSEIN PRESUMABLY WOULD DO UTMOST TO     SECRET  AVOID THIS UNWANTED DEVELOPMENT BUT, UNDER DETERIORATING CON- DITIONS, CONCEIVABLY WOULD HAVE TO AGREE. (BAGHDAD 0527 SUGG- ESTS THIS GOI MOVE UNLIKELY IN VIEW OF CURRENT BAD RELATIONS  WITH CAIRO).\n4. PRESSURES FROM KING FAISAL ARE DIFFICULT TO PREDICT BUT WE SUSPECT THEY TOO WOULD VARY ACCORDING TO TIME-FRAME OF HOST- ILITIES. FAISAL PRESUMABLY AS CAUTIOUS AS HUSSEIN AND NOT LIK- ELY TO DESIRE COMMITMENT OF SAUDI EAST BANK CONTINGENT WHICH INE- VITABLE IF JORDAN JOINS BATTLE. HOWEVER, FAISAL LIKEWISE MAY HAVE HIS EMOTIONAL  LIMITS AND COULD SHIFT PRESSURE FROM RES- TRAINT TO COMMITMENT IF ARAB ROUTE EVIDENT. (JIDDA COMMENTS  WEL- COME).\n5. SHOULD BE EMPHASIZED THAT BY ALL CURRENT LOCAL INDICATIONS, HUSSEIN IS HOLDING TO NON-COMMITMENT RESOLVE. PRIMIN RIFAIS COMMENTS TO BRIT AMBASSADOR (REPORTED SEPTEL) THAT JORDAN DE- TERMINED TO STAY OUT WOULD ONLY MOVE TO DEFEND BORDERS IS LATEST ENCOURAGING EVIDENCE. HOWEVER, WE REMAIN MINDFUL OF  FACT THAT ONE OR MORE OF ABOVE PRESSURES COULD BEGIN BUILDING  WITHIN DAY OR TWO IF FIGHTING CONTINUES. JORDANIANS CLAIM THAT EIGHT ISRAELI PHANTOMS OVERFLEW SUWEILEH, NEAR AMMAN, MID-DAY TODAY ADDS ADDITONAL NOTE OF UNCERTAINTY AS TO INRAELI INTEN- TIONS VIS-A-VIS JORDAN. IF REPORT TRUE, THIS WOULD AMOUNT TO UNN- ECESSARY RISK-TAKING ON GOI SIDE AND ADDITIONAL FACTOR WORKING AGAINST JORDANIAN MODERATION.   GRAHAM\n",1187878
11,0.7035290034761325,5368 Subj: Husseins Views1 Have just returned from meeting with King held in armys war room where                        Jordanian military and civilian leaders congregating They are sleepless and                        living on cigarettes and coffee King himself said he felt incoherent This psychological                        atmosphere must be considered as we look at what he has to say2 First he thinks that the Syrians are going to get a pasting I said I                        agreed as it seemed to me that the Israelis will concentrate first on that                        front that their mobilization is complete and that we may see a different                        story on the Golan than we had had up to now What disturbs him the most is                        that the Israelis will not be content to drive the Syrians back to the                        ceasefire line but will want to pursue and destroy even if this takes them                        to Damascus Of first importance he believes is get point across to                        Israelis that this is unacceptable Here he thinks big powers especially                        US have major responsibility A largescale Israeli invasion of Syria he                        warns could drag Jordan in willynilly2 Second and this is related Israel must stop its constant overflying of                        Jordan Today 64 Israeli planes used Mafraq airbase as a homing area for                        repeated attacks at Syrian targets His air force stood on the ground and                        his pilots feel increasingly humiliated Israeli planes have constantly and                        continuously violated Jordan air space on their forays to and from Syria but                        Mafraq action is a step up over casual passage4 Third the Security Council must act and promptly It cannot simply be a                        call for all parties to return to their original positions A                        straightforward simple demand for a ceasefire is what is needed To it                        should be coupled something which will relaunch negotiations He hopes it                        will come tonight and not drag onAn October 8                            memorandum to Kissinger reported                            Rifais statement that political pressures on Jordan to intervene in the                            current Middle East crisis were reaching an intolerable level and that                            although Jordan could stall for a day or two the King could not                            maintain this position indefinitely Also this position probably could                            not be maintained if the military situation should change

I AM VERY CONCERNED ABOUT (A) KING HUSSEINS SUGGESTION TO AMBASSADOR BROWN THAT JORDAN MIGHT BE SWEPT INTO WAR, AND (B)  THREAT MADE BY ISRAELI MILITARY INTELLIGENCE CHIEF TO MY DATT THAT ISRAEL WILL DESTROY JORDAN AND ITS INFRASTRUCTURE IF JORDAN MOVES AGAINST ISRAEL (REFTELS).\n2. IT SEEMS TO ME WE MUST GO ON ASSUMPTION THAT BOTH ARE ACCURATE STATEMENTS AND MUST TAKE IMMEDIATE ACTION WITH RESPECT TO BOTH GOVERNMENTS. I BELIEVE US SHOULD SIMULANEOUSLY INFORM ISRAELIS THEY SHOULD HALT OVERFLIGHTS OF JORDAN FORTHWITH (IN OUR VIEW, GREATLY IMPROVED IDF POSITION ON SYRIAN FRONT MAKES SUCH OVERFLIGHTS LESS NECESSARY), AND INFORM KING HUSSEIN OF IDF THREAT. IN PROCESS, I FEEL ISRAELIS SHOULD BE INFORMED THAT KING HUSSEIN IN STATESMANLIKE MANNER HAS ATTEMPTED TO CALM DOWN KING FEISAL AND HAS RESISTED HIS REQUEST FOR RELEASE OF SAUDI FORCE IN JORDAN FOR DISPATCH TO SYRIAN FRONT (AMMAN 5367).

SUMMARY:  JORDANIAN AMBASSADOR SALAH CALLED AT DEPART- MENT OCTOBER 23 TO EXPRESS UNHAPPINESS THAT JORDAN BEING KEPT IN DARK ABOUT U.S.-SOVIET TALKS WHILE SOVIETS WERE KEEPING EGYPT AND SYRIA IN PICTURE AND USG DOING SAME WITH ISRAEL.  HE FEARED JORDAN BEING TAKEN FOR GRANTED. DEPUTY ASSISTANT SECRETARY ATHERTON BRIEFED SALAH ALONG LINES STATE 209022, AND STRESSED THAT USG HAS JORDANIAN    SECRET  INTERESTS VERY MUCH IN MIND AND HAS NO DESIRE TO KEEP JORDAN IN DARK. SALAH SAID THAT U.S.-SOVIET SPONSORED OCTOBER 22 SECURITY COUNCIL RESOLUTION APPEARED TO COMPOUND AMBIGUITIES OF RESOLUTION 242.  UNLESS U.S. AND SOVIETS TOOK POSITION ON SUBSTANCE OF SETTLEMENT, WHAT GUARANTEE WAS THERE THAT NEGOTIATIONS TO BREAK DEADLOCK WOULD BE ANY MORE LIKELY TO SUCCEED NOW THAN BEFORE OCTOBER 6?  ATHERTON SAID U.S.-SOVIET TALKS IN MOSCOW HAD FOCUSED ON CEASEFIRE AND PROCEDURES FOR GETTING NEGOTIATIONS STARTED SO THAT PARTIES, UNDER APPROPRIATE AUSPICES, COULD BEGIN TO DEAL WITH SUBSTANTIVE ISSUES.  AS FOR CHANCES FOR GETTING SETTLE- MENT PROCESS MOVING, ATHERTON SAID IT IMPORTANT TO RECOGNIZE NEW SITUATION HAD BEEN CREATED BY LATEST WAR,   BOTH IN ITS PSYCHOLOGICAL IMPACT ON PARTIES, IN CHANGES IN MILITARY SITUATION, AND IN FACT THAT USG AND USSR WERE ENGAGED IN JOINT EFFORTS TO STOP FIGHTING AND GET NEGOTIATIONS STARTED.  FOR ALL THESE REASONS, WE FELT SITUATION TODAY VERY DIFFERENT FROM THAT EXISTING BEFORE OCTOBER 6 AND THERE WAS BETTER OPPORTUNITY NOW FOR REAL PROGRESS TOWARD SETTLEMENT TO BE MADE.  END SUMMARY.  \n2.  AMBASSADOR SALAH OF JORDAN CALLED AT OWN REQUEST ON DEPUTY ASSISTANT SECRETARY ATHERTON ON AFTERNOON OCTOBER 23 TO SEEK BACKGROUND OF SECURITY COUNCIL RESOLUTION 338 OF OCTOBER 22, 1973.  \n3.  SALAH OPENED BY NOTING THAT SYRIANS AND EGYPTIANS APPEARED TO HAVE BEEN CONSULTED BY SOVIETS, AND ISRAELIS WERE VISITED ON OCTOBER 22 BY SECRETARY KISSINGER.  JORDAN, HOWEVER, REMAINED LARGELY ""IN THE DARK"" ABOUT DISCUSSIONS IN MOSCOW WHICH LED TO OCTOBER\n4.  ATHERTON REPLIED HE APPRECIATED JORDANIAN CONCERN AND WANTED TO GIVE AMBASSADOR SALAH AS FULL A BRIEFING AS POSSIBLE ON BACKGROUND OF RESOLUTION.  TIMETABLE OF SECRETARYS TRIP SIMPLY ALLOWED NO TIME FOR VISIT TO AMMAN.  ATHERTON SAID HE WANTED TO CALL ATTENTION OF SALAH NOT ONLY TO TEXT OF RESOLUTION BUT ALSO TO ACCOMPANYING STATEMENT BY AMBASSADOR SCALI.  ATHERTON SAID SCALI STATEMENT, WHICH SALAH DID NOT HAVE, WAS CAREFULLY DRAFTED AND MERITED PRECISE READING.  \n5.  ATHERTON SAID THAT SINCE FIGHTING BROKE OUT U.S. HAD PURSUED TWO OBJECTIVES:  (A) STOP THE FIGHTING, AND (B) LAY BASIS FOR FUTURE PEACE EFFORTS IN MIDDLE EAST.  RESOLUTION 338 IS EFFORT ACCOMPLISH BOTH PURPOSES.  IT CONTAINS PARAGRAPHS CALLING FOR END OF FIGHTING, IMPLEMENTATION OF 242, AND PROCEDURE TO CARRY OUT IMPLEMENTATION OF 242.  ATHERTON SAID EVERYONE AWARE THAT IT NO REPEAT NO USE JUST TO TRY TO STOP THE FIGHTING; IT IS NECESSARY TO END CONDITIONS WHICH LED TO THE FIGHTING.  IN ABSENCE OF DIPLOMATIC   ALTERNATIVE, IT WAS CLEAR THAT THERE WOULD BE MORE WARS IN THE FUTURE.  \n6.  IT ALSO CLEAR, ATHERTON CONTINUED, THAT MIDDLE EAST WAS AREA IN WHICH BOTH US AND USSR HAVE IMPORTANT INTERESTS.  MANNER IN WHICH US AND USSR DEALT WITH PRESENT MIDDLE EAST CRISIS WAS THEREFORE TEST OF NEW US/SOVIET RELATIONSHIP AND OF ERA OF DETENTE.  FACT THAT WE AND SOVIETS AGREED ON FORWARD-LOOKING AND CONSTRUCTIVE RESOLUTION IS VICTORY FOR POLICY OF DETENTE.  \n7.  ATHERTON SAID THAT IMMEDIATE PROBLEM WAS TO STABILIZE CEASEFIRE WHICH HAD BEEN ACCEPTED BY EGYPT, ISRAEL AND JORDAN.  SECURITY COUNCIL MEETING LATER IN DAY OCTOBER 23 WOULD DEAL WITH THIS PROBLEM, IN-    SECRET  CLUDING QUESTION OF HOW TO USE UNTSO TO SUPERVISE CEASEFIRE.  ATHERTON NOTED THAT RESOLUTION WAS NOT SPECIFIC ABOUT MECHANICS OF CEASEFIRE.  THESE MUST BE WORKED OUT BY THE PARTIES, USING UNTSO FACILITIES IF DESIRED.  RELATED ISSUE WAS POW EXCHANGE.  WE HAD BEEN IMPRESSED WHILE IN ISRAEL WITH IMPORTANCE ISRAEL ATTACHES TO EARLY RELEASE OF POWS BY BOTH SIDES. ALTHOUGH THIS NOT IN TEXT OF NEW RESOLUTION, SOVIETS AND USG HAD BOTH AGREED TO URGE EARLY POW RELEASE LEST PRISONER ISSUE BECOME SERIOUS OBSTACLE TO PROGRESS ON OTHER MATTERS.  \n8.  TURNING TO SECOND AND THIRD PARAGRAPHS, AS ""POLITICAL PARTS"" OF RESOLUTION 338, ATHERTON SAID THEY CLOSELY LINKED.  THESE PARAGRAPHS MEAN THAT IMPLEMENTATION OF SC RESOLUTION 242 WOULD PROCEED THROUGH NEGOTIATIONS BETWEEN PARTIES CONCERNED ""UNDER APPROPRIATE AUSPICES.""  ATHERTON NOTED THAT THIS WAS THE FIRST TIME SC HAD ENDORSED NEGOTIATIONS BETWEEN THE PARTIES AS PRACTICAL MEANS OF PROCEEDING TO SOLUTION OF PALESTINE AND ARAB/ISRAEL PROBLEM.  \n9.  ""APPROPRIATE AUSPICES,"" SAID ATHERTON, REMAIN TO BE WORKED OUT IN SPECIFIC TERMS.  US AND SOVIETS HAD AGREED TO MAKE AVAILABLE JOINT GOOD OFFICES TO PARTIES CON- CERNED, IF THEY SO DESIRED.  \n0.  SALAH SAID THAT HE FEARED AMBIGUITY OF SC RESOLUTION\n8. HE NOTED THAT THERE SEEMED TO BE NO CLOSE TIE BETWEEN THE CEASEFIRE AND THE PROCESS OF SETTLEMENT.  THE GOVERNMENT OF JORDAN WOULD NEED SOMETHING MORE SPECIFIC   ON US/SOVIET DISCUSSIONS OR AGREEMENT ON HOW RESOLUTION 242 WOULD BE IMPLEMENTED.  HOW ELSE, HE ASKED, COULD JORDAN ENTER NEGOTIATIONS AS IT WOULD HAVE TO AS A PARTY TO THE CONFLICT?  SALAH SAID THAT ON ITS FACE RESOLUTION 338 APPEARED TO MEAN THAT SC HAD ENDORSED IDEA OF NEGOTIATIONS WHILE OMITTING ANY REFERENCE TO UN OR SECRETARY GENERAL.  SALAH SAID THAT    SECRET  NEGOTIATIONS AND AVOIDANCE OF UN INVOLVEMENT HAD LONG REPRESENTED TWO AIMS OF ISRAELI DIPLOMACY, AND THEY HAD NOW BEEN ADOPTED IN A TIME OF MILITARY ADVANTAGE OF ISRAEL.  \n1.  ATHERTON REPLIED THAT USG HAD LONG SEEN NEGOTIATIONS AS ONLY MEANS OF RESOLVING DIFFERENCES OF INTERPRETATIONS OF RESOLUTION 242.  NOW, HOWEVER, NEGOTIATIONS WOULD TAKE PLACE AGAINST A NEW BACKGROUND. HE URGED SALAH TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT FACT THAT FIGHTING, WHICH VERY COSTLY TO BOTH SIDES, HAD CREATED PSYCHOLOGICAL BACKGROUND VERY DIFFERENT THAN THAT PRIOR TO WAR.  ATHERTON NOTED THIS PSYCHOLOGICAL DIFFERENCE APPLIED TO BOTH SIDES.  SECOND, SAID ATHERTON, US AND USSR WERE NOW JOINTLY ENGAGED IN EFFORT TO GET PROCESS GOING.  THIS IS THE SECOND NEW ELEMENT IN THE SITUATION WHICH GIVES CAUSE FOR HOPE.  FINALLY, SAID ATHERTON, FOCUS OF TALKS IN MOSCOW WAS NOT ON SUBSTANTIVE INTERPRETATIONS OF RESOLUTION 242 BUT ON A RESOLUTION WHICH WOULD BE A FRAMEWORK FOR ENDING HOSTILITIES AND GETTING TALKS GOING.  SALAH COULD NOT EXPECT US AND USSR TO RESOLVE ALL LONG-STANDING DIFFERENCES ON INTERPRETATION OF 242.  \n2.  SALAH ASKED WHAT WOULD MOVE THE ISRAELIS IF THEY DECIDED AFTER THIS LATEST WAR THAT THEIR BEST COURSE OF ACTION WAS TO BECOME MORE OBSTINATE?  WITH NEW LOSSES, SAID SALAH, ISRAELIS MAY DECIDE TERRITORY IS BETTER GUARANTEE OF SECURITY THAN SETTLEMENT. ATHERTON SAID THAT IN HIS JUDGMENT IT WAS TOO SOON TO JUDGE WHAT FINAL IMPACT OF WAR WOULD BE ON ATTITUDES IN ISRAEL.  HE NOTED THAT WAR NOT ONLY HAD BEEN VERY COSTLY BUT CEASEFIRE HAD LEFT FOUR EGYPTIAN DIVISIONS ON EAST BANK OF SUEZ CANAL AS WELL AS ISRAELI ADVANCES IN SYRIA AND WEST OF CANAL.  SITUATION TODAY WAS DIFFERENT PSYCHOLOGICALLY, STRATEGICALLY AND IN ITS MAJOR POWER ASPECTS FROM WHAT IT HAD BEEN BEFORE OCTOBER 6.  \n3.  SALAH ASKED WHO WAS GOING TO INITIATE TALKS?      SECRET  ATHERTON SAID THIS REMAINED TO BE WORKED OUT, BUT NOTED THAT RESOLUTION 338 MADE PROVISION FOR ""APPROPRIATE AUSPICES.""  PROCESS OF DIPLOMACY, INCLUDING BETWEEN US AND USSR, WOULD CONTINUE.  WE ARE DETERMINED TO MAINTAIN MOMENTUM.  \n4.  SALAH ASKED IF IN USG OPINION INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE MIGHT BE APPROPRIATE FORUM FOR INITIATION OF DISCUSSIONS.  ATHERTON REITERATED THAT QUESTION OF WHAT CONSTITUTED ""APPROPRIATE AUSPICES"" REMAINED TO BE WORKED OUT.  \n5.  SALAH SAID THE GOVERNMENT OF JORDAN HOPED THAT THE US INTERPRETATION OF 242, AS SET FORTH IN 1969, STILL STANDS.  ATHERTON SAID HE COULD NOT GIVE AN ANSWER TO THIS QUESTION.  THE ORIGIN OF USG VIEWS ON FRAMEWORK FOR NEGOTIATIONS AS SET FORTH IN 1969 WAS IN US/SOVIET AND FOUR POWER TALKS AT THAT TIME, BUT THEY HAD NOT BEEN ACCEPTED BY ANYONE.  WHAT HE WANTED TO EMPHASIZE, ATHERTON SAID, WAS THAT OUR FOCUS IS NOT REPEAT NOT ON PUTTING FORTH U.S. PLANS FOR A SETTLEMENT BUT ON GETTING NEGOTIATING PROCESS STARTED SO THAT PARTIES COULD PUT OWN VIEWS ON TABLE, WITHOUT PRECONDITIONS. SC RESOLUTION 338 PROVIDED OPPORTUNITY TO DO THIS. SALAH SAID HE FEARED THAT PARAGRAPH 3 OF RESOLUTION 338 WEAKENED PARAGRAPH 2.  LATTER CALLED FOR IMPLEMENTATION OF RESOLUTION 242, BUT FORMER CALLED FOR NEGOTIATIONS. ATHERTON REPLIED THAT SECOND AND THIRD PARAGRAPHS ARE CLOSELY LINKED AND COMPLEMENTARY.  FORMER CALLS FOR IMPLEMENTATION OF RESOLUTION 242; LATTER CALLS FOR NEGOTIATIONS TO ACHIEVE THAT END.  THIS WAS ENVISAGED IN RESOLUTION 242, WHICH RECOGNIZES NEED FOR AGREEMENT BETWEEN PARTIES -- AGREEMENT THAT IS ONLY POSSIBLE THROUGH PROCESS OF NEGOTIATIONS.  \n6.  SALAH RETURNED TO IDEA THAT CONTACTS WITH EVERYONE BUT JORDAN MADE HIM VERY UNEASY.  HE SAID HE HAD PERSONAL FEAR THAT BIG POWERS WERE CONDUCTING BUSINESS WHILE TAKING JORDAN FOR GRANTED.  ATHERTON STRONGLY DENIED THIS, SAYING THAT THE USG HAD THE    SECRET  INTERESTS OF JORDAN VERY MUCH IN MIND.  AS FOR JORDANS BEING LEFT OUT, ATHERTON SAID, HE HAD CONVEYED TO AMBASSADOR SALAH A FULL APPRECIATION OF MOSCOW TALKS, AS WE HAD DONE FOR ISRAEL DURING SECRETARYS STOPOVER IN TEL AVIV.  \n7.  SALAH COMPLAINED HE STILL FELT ""IN THE DARK"" AND   TURNED TO ALLEGED QUOTATION OF PRIME MINISTER MEIR IN KNESSET WHERE SHE REPORTEDLY SAID SHE HAD BEEN ASSURED BY SECRETARY THAT NO PRESSURES WHATSOEVER WOULD BE APPLIED DURING NEGOTIATING PROCESS, WHICH WOULD BE FREE OF OUTSIDE INTERFERENCE.  ATHERTON SAID SALAH SHOULD LOOK TO STATEMENTS OF U.S., NOT ISRAELI SPOKES- MEN AS REPRESENTING POSITION AND VIEWS OF USG.   KISSINGER\n",1187686
13,0.6827151205790073,5368 Subj: Husseins Views1 Have just returned from meeting with King held in armys war room where                        Jordanian military and civilian leaders congregating They are sleepless and                        living on cigarettes and coffee King himself said he felt incoherent This psychological                        atmosphere must be considered as we look at what he has to say2 First he thinks that the Syrians are going to get a pasting I said I                        agreed as it seemed to me that the Israelis will concentrate first on that                        front that their mobilization is complete and that we may see a different                        story on the Golan than we had had up to now What disturbs him the most is                        that the Israelis will not be content to drive the Syrians back to the                        ceasefire line but will want to pursue and destroy even if this takes them                        to Damascus Of first importance he believes is get point across to                        Israelis that this is unacceptable Here he thinks big powers especially                        US have major responsibility A largescale Israeli invasion of Syria he                        warns could drag Jordan in willynilly2 Second and this is related Israel must stop its constant overflying of                        Jordan Today 64 Israeli planes used Mafraq airbase as a homing area for                        repeated attacks at Syrian targets His air force stood on the ground and                        his pilots feel increasingly humiliated Israeli planes have constantly and                        continuously violated Jordan air space on their forays to and from Syria but                        Mafraq action is a step up over casual passage4 Third the Security Council must act and promptly It cannot simply be a                        call for all parties to return to their original positions A                        straightforward simple demand for a ceasefire is what is needed To it                        should be coupled something which will relaunch negotiations He hopes it                        will come tonight and not drag onAn October 8                            memorandum to Kissinger reported                            Rifais statement that political pressures on Jordan to intervene in the                            current Middle East crisis were reaching an intolerable level and that                            although Jordan could stall for a day or two the King could not                            maintain this position indefinitely Also this position probably could                            not be maintained if the military situation should change drastically                            which Rifai thought it ultimately would Therefore Rifai considered it                            essential from the Jordanian point of view to have the Security Council                            call for a ceasefire even if it was not adhered to completely Rifai                            also said that in his opinion Egypt and Syria would not respond to a                            ceasefire call which required them to return to their positions of                            October 5 Library of Congress Manuscript Division Kissinger Papers Box CL 168

       should cool it Jordan has been under pressure before It has stood up well                        This is no time for its resolution to waver Most of all it should not give                        in to the emotional call of other Arabs especially those who have                        absolutely nothing to lose Jordan has Its people its armed forces and                        its future development plans are what are at stake6 King said he agreed with all this but sometimes events have a way of                        getting out of control and carrying national leaders with them He thought                        he could hang on for a few days moreAt 2041Z                            4:41 pm Washington time in telegram 5367 from Amman October 8

SUMMARY: AVAILABLE EVIDENCE STILL SUGGESTS HUSSEIN WILL ATTEMPT TO REMAIN ON SIDELINES. HOWEVER, PRESSURES  FOR JORDANIAN COMMITMENT COULD ERUPT QUICKLY FROM NUMBER OF DIRECTIONS. LATEST (AND UNEXPECTED) FACTOR WORKING AGAINST JORDANIAN MODERATIION IS REPORTED ISRAELI OVERFLIGHT OF AMMAN SUBURBS NOON OCT 7. END SUMMARY\n2. WE HAVE BEEN GIVING CONSIDERABLE THOUGHT TO HUSSEINS LIKELY REACTIONS UNDER VARIETY OF POSSIBLE DEVELOPMENTS. AS AMBASSADOR WARNED IN REFTEL, WE CANNOT TAKE FOR GRANTED THE USUAL ASSUMPTION THAT KING CAAN WITHSTAND INDEFINITELY PRESSURE OF ALL EXTERNAL EVENTS.\n3. MAIN FACTOR FOOR CONSSIDERATION IS TIME-FRAME. IF FIGHTING CAN BE HALTED WITHIN FEW DAYS, HUSSEIN WILL HAVE FAIRLY EASY TIME STAYING OUT. HE UNDOUBTEDLY IS HOPING FOR THIS EARLY RE- PRIEVE. HOWEVER, PRESSURES WILL INCREASE RAPIDLY IF BATTLE BE- COMES PROTRACTED. TIME ALSO WILL DICTATE THE TYPE OF PRESSURES HE MUST FACE. FOR EXAMPLE, AVAILABLE EVIDENCE SUGGESTS COMM- AND LEVEL OFFICERS IN JORDAN ARMY AT PRESENT MOMENT ARE NO MORE ANXIOUS THAN BEFORE TO JOIN ANY BATTLE THEY ARE UNSURE OF WINNING. HOWEVER, IN UNLIKELY EVENT OF ARAB ""STEAMROLLER"" SUCCESS AGAINST ISRAELIS, THIS ATTITUDE LIKELY TO SHIFT TO AGITATION TO JOIN  FRAY. KING, DEPENDING ON ARMY AS POWER BASE AND MINDFUL OF ROLE AS OUSTED SOVEREIGN OF WEST BANK, WOULD FIND IT DIFFICULT TO \n4. PRESSURES FROM KING FAISAL ARE DIFFICULT TO PREDICT BUT WE SUSPECT THEY  TOO WOULD VARY ACCORDING TO TIME-FRAME OF HOST- ILITIES. FAISAL PRESUMABLY AS CAUTIOUS AS HUSSEIN AND NOT LIK- ELY TO DESIRE COMMITMENT OF SAUDI EAST BANK CONTINGENT WHICH INE- VITABLE IF JORDAN JOINS BATTLE. HOWEVER, FAISAL LIKEWISE MAY HAVE HIS EMOTIONAL LIMITS AND COULD SHIFT PRESSURE FROM RES-\n5. SHOULD BE EMPHASIZED THAT BY ALL CURRENT LOCAL INDICATIONS, HUSSEIN IS HOLDING TO NON-COMMITMENT RESOLVE. PRIMIN RIFAIS COMMENTS TO BRIT AMBASSADOR (REPORTED SEPTEL) THAT JORDAN DE- TERMINED TO STAY OUT WOULD OONLY MOVE TO DEFEND BORDERS IS LATEST ENCOURAGING EVIDENCE. HOWEVER, WE REMAIN MINDFUL OF  FACT THAT ONE OR MORE OF ABOVE PRESSSURES COULD BEGIN BUILDING  WITHIN DAY OR TWO IF FIGHTING CONTINUES. JORDANIANS CLAIM THAT EIGHT ISRAELI PHANTOMS OVERFLEW SUWEILEH, NEAR AMMAN, MID-DAY TODAY ADDS ADDITONAL NOTE OF UNCERTAINTY AS TO ISRAELI INTEN- TIONS VIS-A-VIS JORDAN. IF REPORT TRUE, THIS WOULD AMOUNT TO UNN- ECESSARY RISK-TAKING ON GOI SIDE AND ADDITIONAL FACTOR WORKING AGAINST JORDANIAN MODERATION.   GRAHAM\n",1187882

    front that their mobilization is complete and that we may see a different                        story on the Golan than we had had up to now What disturbs him the most is                        that the Israelis will not be content to drive the Syrians back to the                        ceasefire line but will want to pursue and destroy even if this takes them                        to Damascus Of first importance he believes is get point across to                        Israelis that this is unacceptable Here he thinks big powers especially                        US have major responsibility A largescale Israeli invasion of Syria he                        warns could drag Jordan in willynilly2 Second and this is related Israel must stop its constant overflying of                        Jordan Today 64 Israeli planes used Mafraq airbase as a homing area for                        repeated attacks at Syrian targets His air force stood on the ground and                        his pilots feel increasingly humiliated Israeli planes have constantly and                        continuously violated Jordan air space on their forays to and from Syria but                        Mafraq action is a step up over casual passage4 Third the Security Council must act and promptly It cannot simply be a                        call for all parties to return to their original positions A                        straightforward simple demand for a ceasefire is what is needed To it                        should be coupled something which will relaunch negotiations He hopes it                        will come tonight and not drag onAn October 8                            memorandum to Kissinger reported                            Rifais statement that political pressures on Jordan to intervene in the                            current Middle East crisis were reaching an intolerable level and that                            although Jordan could stall for a day or two the King could not                            maintain this position indefinitely Also this position probably could                            not be maintained if the military situation should change drastically                            which Rifai thought it ultimately would Therefore Rifai considered it                            essential from the Jordanian point of view to have the Security Council                            call for a ceasefire even if it was not adhered to completely Rifai                            also said that in his opinion Egypt and Syria would not respond to a                            ceasefire call which required them to return to their positions of                            October 5 Library of Congress Manuscript Division Kissinger Papers Box CL 168

       should cool it Jordan has been under pressure before It has stood up well                        This is no time for its resolution to waver Most of all it should not give                        in to the emotional call of other Arabs especially those who have                        absolutely nothing to lose Jordan has Its people its armed forces and                        its future development plans are what are at stake6 King said he agreed with all this but sometimes events have a way of                        getting out of control and carrying national leaders with them He thought                        he could hang on for a few days moreAt 2041Z                            4:41 pm Washington time in telegram 5367 from Amman October 8                                Brown reported that                                Hussein told him that he had                            just received a message from Faisal asking for release of the Saudi forces stationed                            in Jordan so they could be sent immediately to the Syrian front to take                            part in the battle The King said that Faisals message was semihysterical and very critical                            of Jordanian inaction at moment Syria and Egypt fighting the sacred                            battle Hussein had already                            replied saying that the Saudi troops were needed in their present                            positions in Jordan but told Brown that this was the sort of pressure he was                            increasingly subject to from virtually every Arab state and he begged                            for a prompt ceasefire National Archives Nixon Presidential Materials NSC Files Box 618 Country Files Middle

looks Lets not make any                        decisions tonight8 At another point in conversation King said he thought the Egyptians could                        hang on He said it was his understanding that Sadat would not advance far beyond the canal as he would                        want to keep under the SAM umbrella The                        Israelis could do a lot of damage to the Egyptian forces and the SAM missile sites but probably at great                        expense to the air force Said Rifai disagreed he thought the Egyptians                        would pause for a moment and then move on to attack Mitla moving their                            SAM protection with them I said the                        latter might be more difficult than he envisaged9 The King said that he had not been informed in advance of the                        SyrianEgyptian attack He reminded me that however after each talk he has                        had with the Egyptians in recent months he has told us that it was his                        considered view that Egypt would cross the canal no matter what the odds                        His estimate he continued had been more accurate than USG intelligence10 Comment: King was tired somewhat confused but                        most friendly He had done me favor by getting a Dove to Tobruk in Saudi                        Arabia so that I could get back here When I thanked him he said that all                        he wanted in return was the stabilization of the situation and an immediate                        start on a meaningful settlement for the ME                        If it does not come the Arabs will sit back for a short while convince                        themselves that they could have won the war with a slightly greater effort                        and then relaunch it Who would be running what country then he could not                        guess I think he is

WISH TO POINT OUT POTENTIAL RISKS IN ANY DELAY IN IMPOSING CEASE FIRE WHICH WOULD PERMIT EXTENSION OF HOSTILI- TIES. LEBANESE FRONTIER STILL QUIET AND FEDAYEEN LEADERSHIP AT MOMENT APPEARS TO BE IN DEFENSIVE POSTURE WITH NO IMMEDIATE PLAN TO INITIATE OPERATIONS. HOWEVER, THERE IS SERIOUS QUESTION HOW LONG SUCH POSITION WILL BE MAINTAINED. IF HOSTILITIES CONTINUE ON EGYPTIAN AND SYRIAN FRONTS, I BELIEVE THERE IS HIGH RISK THAT MORE RADICAL FEDAYEEN LEADERS WOULD SEE THIS AS GOLDEN OPPORTUNITY TO LAUNCH LIMITED COMMANDO CROSS-BORDER OPERATIONS INTO ISRAEL FROM LEBANON, THEREBY EMBROILING ISRAELIS AND LEBANESE. ERGO, FROM OUR VANTAGE POINT, EARLIEST POSSIBLE CEASE FIRE IS CALLED FOR.\n5. NEEDLESS TO SAY, ADOPTION OF PUBLIC U.S. POSITION WHICH IN ARAB WORLD APPEARS ONE-SIDED IN FAVOR OF ISRAEL WOULD ALSO MERELY ENHANCE TENDENCY IN ARAB WORLD (INCLUDING FEDAYEEN) TO LASH OUT AT US INTERESTS IN RETALIATION.

PRIOR TO MY MEETING WITH MRS MEIR TODAY, I HAD ABOUT THIRTY MINUTES WITH DEPRIMIN ALLON IN CABINET ROOM ADJOINING PMS OFFICE.\n2.  ALLON DESCRIBED SITUATION IN SOUTH ALONG LINES ALREADY REPORTED WITH EMPHASIS ON FACT THAT ISRAEL HAD NOT TAKEN INITIATIVE TO VIOLATE CEASEFIRE.  HE REITERATED GOI POSITION THAT EGYPTIANS INITATED MASSIVE VIOLATION OF CEASEFIRE TODAY IN ORDER MAKE SUPREME - AND HOPEFULLY LAST - EFFORT BREAK IDF SEIGE OF THIRD ARMY.  HE NOTED HOW TEMPTING IT WOULD BE FOR ISRAEL TO GIVE IDF THE 3-5 MORE DAYS REQUIRED ALONG SUEZ FRONT TO WIN A MILITARY VICTORY OVER EGYPT OF TRULY ASTOUNDING PROPORTIONS - THE DESTRUCTION OF THE ENTIRE EGYPTIAN ARMY.  WHEN ONE RECALLS WHAT THE MILITARY SITUATION WAS IN SOUTH WHEN FIGHTING BEGAN, SUCH A\n3.  REFERRING TO THE TEMPTATION IN PURELY MILITARY TERMS TO FINISH OFF THE EGYPTAIN ARMY, ALLON SAID THAT HE RECOGNIZED THIS PROBABLY WAS THE WRONG THING TO DO FROM POINT OF VIEW OF ANY HOPE FOR PEACE IN THE AREA THROUGH NEGOTIATIONS.  IN THIS RESPECT, HE NOTED IT WAS PROBABLY A GOOD THING EGYPTIANS COULD STILL CLAIM SOME SEMBLANCE OF VICTORY IN HAVING CROSSED THE CANAL AND, AT LEAST IN SOME PLACES, STAYED THERE AND ALL THIS IMPLIED FOR EGYPTIAN PRIDE AND HONOR.\n4.  ALLON THEN TURNED TO THE NORTHERN FRONT POINTING OUT IT WAS TOTALLY QUIET, ""NOT A SINGLE SHOT.""  HE NOTED THIS SHOULD BE CONVINCING\n5.  ALLON DESCRIBED IN SOME DETAIL THE CAPTURE OF MT. HERMON, NOTING THAT BY CAPTURING THE LAST SYRIAN HELD POST ISRAEL HAD TOTAL CONTROL OF THIS MOST STRATEGIC POSITION.  IN THIS RESPECT HE ALSO NOTED THE CAPTURED SYRIAN POSITION IS ASTRIDE THE ""ARAFAT TRAIL,"" A FAVORITE INFILTRATION ROUTE OF THE FEDAYEEN FROM LEBANON TO ISRAEL.\n6. ALLON THEN EXPANDED ON THE SUBJECT OF THE PROBLEM OF THE FEDAYEEN BY STATING ""AS YOU KNOW, WE ARE TAKING CARE OF YOUR FRIENDS AS WELL,"" MAKING CLEAR HE WAS REFERRING TO GOI DECISION TO ABSTAIN FROM ATTACKS ON JORDAN OR RETALIATION AGAINST THE FEDAYEEN IN LEBANON. HE THEN EXPLAINED THAT ON BEHALF OF MRS. MEIR HE WAS RECEIVING THE DELEGATIONS OF CIVILIANS FROM THE ISRAELI SETTLEMENTS IN THE NORTH THAT ARE UNDER ATTACK BY THE FEDAYEEN. IT IS BECOMING INCREASINGLY DIFFICULT FOR THE GOI TO TELL THESE PEOPLE WHY THE IDF IS NOT PROTECTING THEM, PARTICULARLY NOW THAT EVEN SYRIA HAS ACCEPTED THE CEASEFIRE. HE EMPHASIZED THAT GOI ACTIONS AGAINST THE FEDAYEEN TO DATE HAVE BEEN CONFINED TO AMBUSHES AND OTHER ACTIONS TOTALLY ON ISRAELI SOIL. ISRAEL, HE NOTED, UNDERSTOOD THE DILEMMA. LEBANON CLAIMS IT IS TOO WEAK TO CONTROL THE FEDAYEEN; ISRAEL COULD VERY EASILY CONTROL THEM BY SENDING A NUMBER OF SMALL UNITS INTO SOUTHERN LEBANON. THIS, OF    SECRET  COURSE, WOULD CREATE ANOTHER POLITICAL CRISIS WHICH ISRAEL SINCERELY WISHES TO AVOID. HE STRESSED THAT HE HOPED THE LEBANESE HAD BY NOW LEARNED THE SIGNIFICANCE OF MRS. MEIRS WORDS AND BY THIS HE MEANT THE FERENCE TO THE FEDAYEEN IN HER REMARKS TO THE KNESSET YESTERDAY. THIS, HE STRESSED, WAS A CLEAR WARNING THAT THE LEBANESE HAD TO ACT OR THE GOI WOULD BE FORCED TO BY DOMESTIC PRESSURES.\n7.  I TOOK THIS OCCASION TO SUMMARIZE THE MANY EFFORTS WE HAVE MADE WITH THE GOL, STRESSING AMBASSADOR BUFFUMS LATEST HIGH LEVEL CONVERSATIONS IN BEIRUT, DRAWING LIBERALLY ON BEIRUTS 12333. ALLON WAS PARTICULARLY IMPRESSED BY THE INFORMATION THAT PRESIDENT FRANGI HAD CONVOKED THE LEBANESE MILITARY WITHIN THE PAST FEW DAYS AND HE SAID ""I HOPE THIS WILL PRODUCE THE REQUIRED RESULT."" I TOLD HIM THAT WE ARE NOT, OF COURSE, IN A POSITION TO GUARANTEE ANYTHING BUT IT SEEMED CLEAR LEBANESE WERE TRYING AND UNDERSTOOD THE CEASEFIRE WAS A PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT NEW ELEMENT IN SITUATION. WE WOULD, HOWEVER, MAKE SURE GOL UNDERSTOOD SIGNIFICANCE OF MRS. MEIRS COMMENTS BEFORE KNESSET.\n8. AMBASSADOR BUFFUN IS PERFECTLY FREE TO DRAW ON RELEVANT PORTIONS OF THIS TELEGRAM IN CONVERSATIONS WITH GOL ON PROBLEM OF NECESSITY CONTROL FEDAYEEN. KEATING\n",1187493
