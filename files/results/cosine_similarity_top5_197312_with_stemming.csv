Israel is                        prepared for worst but wants to avoid breakdown of ceasefire and will not                        take initiative to upset it Eban                        recalling his

DATT2 Eban opened conversation by stating                        PriMin Meir had asked him to review                        with me very serious situation which had developed as result of various                        Egyptian attitudes and actions which threaten to lead to destruction of                        ceasefire and resumption of largescale hostilities Yariv interjected that                        info lead Israelis to believe such a move could be taken Dec 5 or Dec 6                            Eban stated that he had just been                        informed that Egyptians were planning to prevent ship from Eilat from                        transitting BAM This made conversation                        even more urgent and situation could only be described as explosive3 At Ebans request Yariv reviewed                        latest meeting with Gamasy at                            KM 101See                                footnote 2 Document 364 Yariv                        said that in private conversation he told Gamasy that maintenance of ceasefire in land sea and air                        linked to continuing supply for Suez City and 3rd Army Yariv said he made                        no threats just a flat statement In reply Gamasy never suggested that the ceasefire might not hold at                            BAM Gamasy said he believed Yarivs statements that Israel                        wanted peace not resumption of hostilities and Gamasy said he had communicated this to                            Sadat In same conversation                        Yariv claims Gamasy agreed despite lack of progress                        on disengagement to meet again on SundayDecember 2 only to change his mind once he returned to tent                        obviously as result of being reminded of his instructions to break off                        talks4 Eban then read excerpts from                        telegram just received from Israeli Mission in UN re the Egyptian memo sent to Waldheim on November 30The                            Egyptian dmarche was in the form of a message from Foreign Minister                                Fahmi to Waldheim The text is in telegram 5280                            from USUN December 1 National                            Archives RG 59 Central Foreign Policy                            Files noting following points:A GOE decided to end all military                        contacts at KM 101B It clear from GOE and Siilasvuo contacts with Israelis that                            GOI used talks only to get back POWs                        and stalling on question of disengagementC GOE regards 6 points as inseparable                        package Israel cannot choose which points to implement and ignore                        otherD Question of disengagement is military matter and must be resolved before                        parties can meet in Geneva peace conference to discuss broader political                        matters5 Eban then passed on report received                        from Tekoah re Siilasvuo conversation with Egyptian                        warning Ismael along lines USUN 5260Telegram 5260 from USUN November 30 reported a conversation between Egyptian                            War Minister Ismael and General Siilasvuo in which Ismael charged that Israel never                            intended to reach an agreement in the KM                            101 talks Ismael wanted to hear Dayans comments before Egypt would consider resuming                            the talks Ibid He confirmed Siislasvuo would see Dayan tomorrow in Jerusalem and noted as a                        glimmer of hope Ismaels reported willingness to wait for results of this                        conversation before definitely shutting off KM 101 talks6 Eban noted that if asked 24 hours                        ago to give assessment of Egyptian policy he would have said GOE wanted to go to Geneva to negotiate in                        good faith After series of recent developments and he repeated concern                        about BAM GOI is uncertain as to what Egyptians really want and what they                        intend to do7 Eban reviewed his conversations in                        Washington with Secretary noting GOI had                        complied with Secy request that discussions on disengagement be postponed to                        Geneva In so doing GOI had also relied on                        Secy belief he could hold the line on the ceasefire and also avoid a                        return to the Security Council in the period before the opening of the conf                        Israel urgently requests the Secretarys appraisal of the US ability to                        deliver in view of the latest developments which indicate a change in                        Egyptian policy He asked that the US take action with the Egyptians                            UN and others presumably the USSR as appropriate in order to avoid a breakdown in the                        ceasefire and to continue the momentum towards Geneva8 Eban also noted that GOI was upset that Egyptians and UN were charging Israel with reneging on                        promises to negotiate in good faith at KM                        101 talks with widespread press play This not true and Israel now had to                        take some steps with press to correct this impression He added it would                        be useful if US could aid GOI in this                        effort to set record straight9 In our discussions with the Egyptians Eban asked that we emphasize that Israel does not want war                        In view of latest indications re Egyptian readiness to renew hostilities                        however Israel has to be and is prepared for war if necessary Eban reminded me that Israels original                        interest had been seriously to discuss disengagement at KM 101 if this is what is required to get the                        peace express back on the tracks Israel of course would be willing again                        to engage the Egyptians in such discussions in this forumComment: I assume we either are already or will soon                        be engaging in discussions

FOLLOWING IS EMBASSY SUMMARY OF DEC 28 EBAN INTERVIEW CONDUCTED BY DAVAR CORRESPONDENTS TADMOR AND BLOCH ON GENEVA CONFERENCE AND IMPLICATIONS OF KNESSET ELECTION FOR MIDEAST PEACE PROSPECTS.\n2. US-SOVIET MIDEAST ROLE. EBAN SAID THAT AMERICANS AND SOVIETS ARE UNITED AS CO-CHAIRMEN BY THEIR DESIRE TO PREVENT MIDDLE EAST FROM REMAINING WAR AREA AND CAUSING DETERIORATING OF SUPERPOWERS RELATIONS. BOTH WANT TO DEFUSE DANGEROUS SITUATION CREATED BY UNCLASSIFIED  CLOSE PROXIMITY OF EGYPTIAN AND ISRAELI FORCES. WAR HAS TURNED CLOCK BACK ON DETENTE. ENERGY CRISIS ALSO HAS HAD MODERATING PSYCHOLOGICAL INFLUENCE ON GENEVA CONFERENCE.\n3. GENEVA CONFERENCE--OPENING PHASE. EBAN SAID THAT OPEING SESSION HAS CREATED UPRECEDENTED ATMOSPHERE OF EXPECTATION. SEVERE JUDG- MENT AWAITS WHOEVER WOULD BE RESPONSIBLE FOR FAILURE OF CONFERENCE. CONFERENCE HAS CREATED NEW FRAMEWORK FOR HANDLING MIDEAST CONFLICT BY LIMITING PARTICIPATION ONLY TO THOSE PARTIES DIRECTLY CONCERNED AND BY ADOPTION OF PRINCIPLE OF CONSENSUS. WHERAS IN SECURITY COUNCIL ARABS SOUGHT ADOPTION OF ANTI-ISRAELI DECISIONS, PARTIES AT GENEVA ARE SEEKING TO ARRIVE AT CONSENSUS, PROVIDING ISRAEL WITH MAXIMUM DEFENSE AGAINST COERCION.\n4. TIMING OF DISENGAGEMENT TALKS. EBAN SAID THAT DECISION TO START DISENGAGEMENT TALKS BEFORE JAN 1 WAS TAKEN IN CLOSED SESSION OF FOREIGN MINISTERS. KISSINGER AND GROMYKO INVESTED CONSIDERABLE EFFORT IN PERSUADING ISRAEL TO ENTER INTO THESE TALKS EVER BEFORE JAN 1. DESENGAGEMENT TALKS ARE IMPORTANT TO EGYPTIANS, SOVIETS AND AMERICANS BECAUSE THEY CREAT LINK IN A CHAIN WHICH PROMISES CONTINUATION OF THE CONFERENCE. EGYPT HAS BEEN CONCERNED BY SYRIAN NON-PARTICIPATION AT OPENING PHASE. JORDANIAN PARTICIPATION ONLY UNDERSCORED EGYPTS ISOLATION, WITH LIBYA, IRAQ, PALESTINIANS AND OTHERS REGARDING WAR AS PREFERABLE TO A PEACE CONFERENCE.\n5. SEPARATION OF FORCES. GENEVA TALKS WILL CONTINUE ON PATTERN ESTABLISHED AT KILOMETER 101. AMERICANS HAVE REJECTED SOVIET ATTEMPT TO INVOLVE THEMSELVES DIRECTLY. GROMYKO HAD TOLD EBAN THAT WITHDRAWAL, MEANING A SERIOUS SEPARATION, NOT JUST WITHDRAWAL FROM WEST BANK TO EAST BANK OF SUEZ CANAL, WAS VITAL FOR PEACE. SOVIETS AND EGYPTIANS WANT A WIDE BUFFER ZONE AND REOPENING OF SUEZ CANAL TO NEUTRALIZE DANGER OF WAR.\n6. PROSPECTS FOR ISRAEL-EGYPT AGREEMENT. EBAN SAID THAT GAP BETWEEN ISRAELIS AND EGYPTIANS WAS STILL WIDE. FAHMI WAS NOT ENTHUSIASTIC ABOUT ISRAELI DEFINITION OF SUBSTANCE OF PEACE. SINE EGYPTIANS DO NOT ACCEPT ISRAELS PEACE DEMANDS IN FULL, THEY CAN- NOT EXPECT THAT ISRAEL SHOUL* ACCEPT THEIR DEMAND FOR COMPLETE WITHDRAWAL. FIRST DECISION OF NEW ISRAELI GOVERNMENT IN JANUARY WILL BE TO DECIDE TO WHAT POINT IN SINAI ISRAEL WOULD BE PREPARED TO WITHDRAW WITHIN FRAMEWORK OF SEPARATION OF FORCES AGREEMENT-- UNCLASSIFIED  AND *HAT WILL BE COUNTER-VALUE DEMANDED. ISRAEL DOES NOT YET KNOW TO WHAT EXTENT AMERICANS WILL TRY TO CURTAIL MOMENTUM OF WITHDRAWAL WHICH SOVIETS AND EGYPTIANS WILL EXPECT.\n7. ISRAEL-SOVIET RELATIONS. AT THIS STAGE THERE IS NO POSSIBILITY OF RESUMPTION OF DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS. THIS WILL BE A REALISTIC SUBJECT ONLY AS A RESULT OF SERIOUS PROGRESS--THAT IS, A ""SIZABLE WITHDRAWAL"" FROM OUR PRESENT POSITIONS ON EGYPTIANS FRONT. BUT SOVIETS ARE INTERESTED IN MAINTAINING DIRECT TALKS WITH ISRAEL. SOVIET MOTIVATIONS ARE: A) DESIRE TO CONSOLIDATE THEIR POSITION AT GENEVA CONFERENCE; B) LACK OF SOVIET MOBILITY IN PREPARATIONS FOR CONFERENCE WHILE KISSINGER WAS ABLE TO MOVE EASILY ON BOTH SIDES; C) A REMAINDER TO ARABS THAT SOVIETS IDENTIFY WITH THEIR DEMAND FOR RETURN OF ALL TERRITORIES BUT NOT WITH ARAB PHILO- SOPHY OF WIPING ISRAEL OFF MAP. SOVIETS REGARD ISRAEL AS MIDDLE EAST COUNTRY ENTITLED TO LIVE IN PEACE AND SECURITY; D) SOVIETS BELIEVE THEY HAVE SOMETHING TO OFFER ISRAEL IN HER PRESENT ISOLATED INTERNATIONAL POSITION--TO HELP ISRAEL REHABILITATE HER POLITICAL POSITION IN WORLD.\n8. ISRAEL-JORDAN. EBAN SAID THAT HE HAS NO OBJECTION IN PRIN- CIPLE TO RIFAIS PROPOSAL, WHICH CAME AS A SUPRISE, BUT THAT THERE HAD TO BE PROCESS OF CONSULTATION BEFORE ESTABLISHMENT OF ANY WORKING GROUP. ON SUBSTANCE, ONE DID NOT HAVE TO TAKE LITERALLY PROPOSAL TO DISCUSS DISENGAGEMENT OF FORCES. WHAT IS MEANT IS THAT THERE SHOULD BE AN ISRAELI-JORDANIAN DISCUSSION ON AN INTERIM SETTLEMENT WITHOUT JORDAN HAVING TO WAIT IN LINE FOR ITS TURN. IN ANY CASE SETTLEMENT WITH EGYPT ALONE CANNOT BE STABLE FOR ANY LENGTH OF TIME IF IT COMES TO PASS AT ALL.\n9. PALESTINIANS. THIS ISSUE PLAYED LESS IMPORTANT ROLE AT GENEVA OPEINING THAN ISRAEL HAD ANTICIPATED. CONFERENCE CONSISTED OF REPRESENTATIVES OF STATES, NOT ORGANIZATIONS. JORDANIAN DELE- GATION HAD INCLUDED SEVEN PALESTINIANS.\n0. UN AUSPICES. SUSPICIONS ABOUT UN AUSPICES HAVE TURNED OUT TO BE EXAGGERATED.\n1. SYRIAN PARTICIPATION. IT IS STILL POSSIBLE THAT SYRIANS WILL ATTEND THE CONFERENCE. FOR TIME BEING THEY HAVE NOT ASKED TO CANCEL FACT THAT THEY PARTICIPATE IN GENEVA CONFERENCE. UNCLASSIFIED  12. KNESSET ELECTION. THERE ARE HARDLY APPROPRIATE WORDS TO DESCRIBE HOW FATEFUL ELECTION RESULTS REALLY ARE. VERY THOUGHT THAT BEGIN AND TAMIR (LIKUD) WOULD BE SITTING IN GENEVA, WITH THEIR DOGMATIC ATTITUDE, IS NIGHTMARE FOR ANYONE WHO HAS SERIOUS APPROACH TO CAUSE OF PEACE. ANOTHER DANGER IS THAT PRESENT LEADERSHIP MAY BE HAMPERED BY SUCH A MINUTE DIFFERENCE IN VOTES BETWEEN ALIGNMENT AND LIKUD, WITH NATIONAL RELIGIOUS PARTY (NRP) VASCILLATING BETWEEN THEM, THAT IT MAY BE FORCED TO SET UP IMPOTENT GOVERNMENT. GIVEN VIEWS OF RELIGIOUS PARTIES, LABOR ALIGNMENT MAY HAVE TO SEEK CHANNELS TO LIBERAL PARTY (LIKUD), WHICH IS LESS DOGMATIC THAN NRP IN POLITICAL AFFAIRS. KEATING\n",682140
6,0.6787544367465325,9700 Subject: Middle East TalksSummary: At request of PriMin Meir                            FonMinAbba Eban expressed to me today                        serious concern over explosive situation existing between Egypt and Israel                        as result of GOE insisting disengagement be                        settled in KM 101 forum prior to opening of                        peace conf GOE breaking off KM 101 talks Egyptian threatening order of                        battle and GOE intention stop Israeli ship                        from transitting BAM He stated Israel is                        prepared for worst but wants to avoid breakdown of ceasefire and will not                        take initiative to upset it Eban                        recalling his conversation with Secretary in WashingtonSee footnote 4 Document                                350 requested that US take urgent action with GOE UN and                        others as appropriate to hold the line on ceasefire to avoid a return to                        the polemics of the Security Council and to keep momentum going towards                        opening of peace conference as scheduled End summary1 At FonMin Ebans request I met with him today at 11:00 local at his                        home in Herzliya Also present were Evron MFA Gen Yariv DCM                        and DATT2 Eban opened conversation by stating                        PriMin Meir had asked him to review                        with me very serious situation which had developed as result of various                        Egyptian attitudes and actions which threaten to lead to destruction of                        ceasefire and resumption of largescale hostilities Yariv interjected that                        info lead Israelis to believe such a move could be taken Dec 5 or Dec 6                            Eban stated that he had just been                        informed that Egyptians were planning to prevent ship from Eilat from                        transitting BAM This made conversation                        even more urgent and situation could only be described as explosive3 At Ebans request Yariv reviewed                        latest meeting with Gamasy at                            KM 101See                                footnote 2 Document 364 Yariv                        said that in private conversation he told Gamasy that maintenance of ceasefire in land sea and air                        linked to continuing supply for Suez City and 3rd Army Yariv said he made                        no threats just a flat statement In reply Gamasy never suggested that the ceasefire might not hold at                            BAM Gamasy said he believed Yarivs statements that Israel                        wanted peace not resumption of hostilities and Gamasy said he had communicated this to                            Sadat In same conversation                        Yariv claims Gamasy agreed despite lack of progress                        on disengagement to meet again on SundayDecember 2 only to change his mind once he returned to tent                        obviously as result of being reminded of his instructions to break off                        talks4 Eban then read excerpts from                        telegram just received from Israeli Mission in UN re the Egyptian memo sent to Waldheim on November 30The                            Egyptian dmarche was in the form of a message from Foreign Minister                                Fahmi to Waldheim The text is in telegram 5280                            from USUN December 1 National                            Archives RG 59 Central Foreign Policy                            Files noting following points:A GOE decided to end all military                        contacts at KM 101B It clear from GOE and Siilasvuo contacts with Israelis that                            GOI used talks only to get back POWs                        and stalling on question of disengagementC GOE regards 6 points as inseparable                        package Israel cannot choose which points to implement and ignore                        otherD Question of disengagement is military matter and must be resolved before                        parties can meet in Geneva peace conference to discuss broader political                        matters5 Eban then passed on report received                        from Tekoah re Siilasvuo conversation with Egyptian                        warning Ismael along lines USUN 5260Telegram 5260 from USUN November 30 reported a conversation between Egyptian                            War Minister Ismael and General Siilasvuo in which Ismael charged that Israel never                            intended to reach an agreement in the KM                            101 talks Ismael wanted to hear Dayans comments before Egypt would consider resuming                            the talks Ibid He confirmed Siislasvuo would see Dayan tomorrow in Jerusalem and noted as a                        glimmer of hope Ismaels reported willingness to wait for results of this                        conversation before definitely shutting off KM 101 talks6 Eban noted that if asked 24 hours                        ago to give assessment of Egyptian policy he would have said GOE wanted to go to Geneva to negotiate in                        good faith After series of recent developments and he repeated concern                        about BAM GOI is uncertain as to what Egyptians really want and what they                        intend to do7 Eban reviewed his conversations in                        Washington with Secretary noting GOI had                        complied with Secy request that discussions on disengagement be postponed to                        Geneva In so doing GOI had also relied on                        Secy belief he could hold the line on the ceasefire and also avoid a                        return to the Security Council in the period before the opening of the conf                        Israel urgently requests the Secretarys appraisal of the US ability to                        deliver in view of the latest developments which indicate a change in                        Egyptian policy He asked that the US take action with the Egyptians                            UN and others presumably the USSR as appropriate in order to avoid a breakdown in the                        ceasefire and to continue the momentum towards Geneva8 Eban also noted that GOI was upset that Egyptians and UN were charging Israel with reneging on                        promises to negotiate in good faith at KM                        101 talks with widespread press play This not true and Israel now had to                        take some steps with press to correct this impression He added it would                        be useful if US could aid GOI in this                        effort to set record straight9 In our discussions with the Egyptians Eban asked that we emphasize that Israel does not want war                        In view of latest indications re Egyptian readiness to renew hostilities                        however Israel has to be and is prepared for war if necessary Eban reminded me that Israels original                        interest had been seriously to discuss disengagement at KM 101 if this is what is required to get the                        peace express back on the tracks Israel of course would be willing again                        to engage the Egyptians in such discussions in this forumComment: I assume we either are already or will soon                        be engaging in discussions with the Egyptians and others along the lines                        requested by the IsraelisIn telegram 236858 to                            Cairo December 4 Kissinger sent                            a message to Fahmi urging that                            the Egyptian military representative return to the Kilometer 101 talks                            and promising that he would speak to the

GENEVA PEACE CONFERENCE OPENED WITH NO SURPRISES AT\n2. MORNING SESSION WAS DEVOTED ENTIRELY TO STATEMENTS BY WALDHEIM AND ALL FOREIGN MINISTERS EXCEPT EBAN, WHO SPOKE AT\n3. WALKEIMS OPENING STATEMENT WAS BRIEF AND BLAND. GROMYKO, WHO SPOKE NEXT, GAVE RELATIVELY SHORT AND RESTRAINED SPEECH, STATING STANDARD SOVIET CRITICISM OF ISRAEL AND SUPPORT FOR ARAB NEGOTIATING POSITIONS BUT INCLUDING MORE THAN USUAL EMPHASIS ON NEED TO ACCEPT ISRAELI SOVEREIGNTY AND RIGHT TO NATIONAL EXISTENCE. GROMYKO WAS FOLLOWED BY SECRETARY KISSINGER (FULL TEXT BY SEPTEL).\n4. ORIGINAL PLAN HAD BEEN FOR EGYPTIAN, JORDANIAN AND ISRAELI FOREIGN MINISTERS TO SPEAK AT SECOND OPEN SESSION SATURDAY MORNING, WITH FRIDAY AFTERNOON FREE FOR BILATERAL CONSULTATIONS. EGYPTIAN FOREIGN MINISTER FAHMY, HOWEVER, INSISTED ON SPEAKING FIRST DAY, AND AS CONSEQUENCE SO DID JORDANIAN AND ISRAELI.\n5. FAHMYS SPEECH, WHILE REAFFIRMING ALL STANDARD EGYPTIAN POSITIONS IN UNCOMPROMISING LANGUE, HAD MINIMUM OF RHETORIC AND REITERATED FREQUENTLY THAT EGYPTIAN OBJECTIVE IS PEACEFUL SETTLEMENT  RECOGNIZING SOVEREIGNTY OF ALL STATES IN AREA. JORDANIAN PRIME MINISTER AND FOREIGN MINISTER ZAID RIFAI, OBVIOUSLY WITH EYE TO PROTECTING FLANKS IN ARAB WORLD, GAVE CONSIDERABLY MORE HARD-LINE SPEECH THAN FAHMY, WITH EXTENSIVE ATTACKS ON ISRAEL AND MINIMAL EMPHASIS ON NEED FOR PEACEFUL SETTLEMENT.\n6. WHEN CONFERENCE RECONVENED FOR AFTERNOON SESSION, EBAN DELIVERED MODERATE SPEECH WHICH, WHIILE EXPRESSING SKEPTICISM CONFIDENTIAL RE ARAB INTENTIONS, CONSTITUTED ELOQUENT PLEA FOR RECON- CILIATION. IN ONLY EXERCISE OF RIGHT OF REPLY, FAHMY DELIVERED POLEMICAL, INTEMPERATE AND SOMEWHAT RAMBLING COMMENTARY ON EBANS SPEECK,ACCUSING EBAN AMONG OTHER THINGS OF PLAYING TO ISRAELI DOMESTIC OPINION IN ELECTORAL CAMPAIGN, WHILE HIMSELF OBVIOUSLY MAKING POINTS FOR ARAB HOME CONSUMPTION.\n7. BEFORE ADJOURNING AFTERNOON SESSION, WALDHEIM ANNOUNCED THERE WOULD BE CLOSED MEETING AT 11:00 AM SATURDAY, TO REVIEW WORKING PROCEDURES FOR CONFERENCE. GROMYKO INTERJECTED THAT HE ASSUMED QUESTIONS OF SUBSTANCE ALSO COULD BE RAISED, TO WHICH NO OBJECTIONS WERE RAISED.\n8. FOLLOWING ARE SUMMARIES OF SPEECHES AT TODAYS OPENING SESSION.\n9. WALDHEIM IN HIS OPENING REMARKS REMINDED CONFERENCE PARTI- CIPKKTS OF INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITYS CONCERN REGARDING SUCCESS OF THEIR UNDERTAKING AND POINTED OUT THAT SECURITY COUNCIL HAD EXPRESSED HOPE THAT CONFERENCE WOULD MAKE SPEEDY PROGRESS. UN HAS BEEN SEIZED OF MIDDLE EAST CONFLICT FOR PAST\n1. HE EXPRESSED HOPE THAT CONFERENCE WOULD MAKE PROGRESS ON DISENGAGEMENT, AND AT LATER STAGE ON PEACE, AND OFFERED UN ASSISTANCE IN ATTAINING THESE GOALS.\n0. GROMYKO FOLLOWED WITH RELATIVELY SHORT, RESTRAINED SPEECH. STRESSED DANGER THAT ARAB-ISRAELI CONFLICT PRESENTED TO REGIONAL, AS  WELL AS WORLD PEACE IF THE BASIS CAUSES OF DISPUTE WERE NOT RESOLVED. SAID ARABS WOULD NEVER AGREE TO LOSS OF THEIR TERRITORY THAT WAS OCCUPIED IN 1967, AND SOVIETS WLD GIVE THEM SUPPORT\n1. GROMYKO SAID MOST IMPORTANT PRINCIPLE IN APPROACH TO MIDDLE EAST PEACE IS THAT CITED IN S.C. RES. 242, VIZ. CONFIDENTIAL INADMISSIBILITY OF ACQUISITION OF TERRITORY BY WAR. AS LONG AS ISRAELI FORCES REMAINED ON ARAB TERRITORY, THERE WOULD BE NO PEACE. SAID ANY DOCUMENT DRAFTED BY THIS CONF SHOULD BE CLEAR-CUT DECLARATION TO ISRAEL TO VACATE OCCUPIED TERRITORY. WITHOUT THIS, CONF WOULD NOT PRODUCE RESULTS; WITH IT ALL OTHER PROBLEMS, INCLUDING THAT OF PALESTINIANS, COULD BE READILY RESOLVED.\n2. NOTING VERY EXISTENCE OF ISRAEL HAD BEEN BROUGHT ABOUT BY UN RESOLUTION, GROMYKO SAID IT WAS CLEAR THAT ALL STATES HAVE RIGHT TO EXISTENCE, BUT THIS COULD NOT BE ""UNILATERAL RIGHT"" WHICH IGNORED RIGHTS OF OTHERS. RIGHT OF EXISTENCE ENTAILED MUTUAL OBLIGATIONS WITH OTHER STATES. GROMYKO SAID SC RES. 242 STILL REPRESENTED REALISTIC APPROACH TO PEACE SETTLEMENT. CALLED ON CONF TO PRODUCE ""CONCRETE, REALISTIC PROPOSAL"" WHICH WOULD IMPLEMENT RES. 242. HE SAID AGREEMENT REACHED BETWEEN PARTIES SHOULD BE EMBODIED IN CONF DOCUMENTS, WHICH HE SAID SHOULD BE ""WEIGHTY"" DOCUMENTS, HAVING FORCE OF LAW. OBLIGATION THUS ASSUMED UNDER INTERNATIONAL LAW WOULD BE BEST GUARANTEE FOR MUTUAL SECURITY.IF ADDITIONAL GUARANTEES PROVED NECESSARY, USSR TAKING INTO ACCOUNT INTERESTS OF OTHER PARTIES, WOULD BE WILLING TO ACCEPT ADDITIONAL RESPONSIBILITY OF FURTHER GUARANTEES. HE SAID SECURITY COUNCIL WOULD ALSO HAVE ROLE ALONG THESE LINES WHICH COULD BE WORKED OUT IN THE NEGOTIATIONS.\n3. REFERRING AGAIN TO DANGERS OF RENEWED HOSTILITIES, GROMYKO NEVERTHELESS EXPRESSED HOPE CONF COULD PRODUCE RELIABLE PEACE. SAID SOVIET UNION WAS NOT HOSTILE TO ISRAEL PER SE, ONLY TO POLICY OF ANNEXATION. CONCLUDED BY SAYING SOVIET UNION WOULD DO EVERYTHING IN ITS POWER TO MAKE CONF SUCCEED AND SEE IT PROCEED IN CONSTRUCTIVE, EFFECTIVE MANNER.\n4. EGYPTIAN FOREIGN MINISTER FAHMY DELIVERED GENERALLY MODERATE ADDRESS. FAHMY SAID MIDDLE EAST HAS SUFFERED FROM MILITARISTIC AND EXPANSIONIST POLICY OF ISRAEL WHICH HAS SERIOUSLY ENDANGERED INDEPENDENCE AND TERRITORIAL INTEGRITY OF COUNTRIES IN AREA. HOWEVER, HE DID NOT WISH TO DWELL ON THIS. EGYPT HOPED THAT AS RESULT OF OCTOBER WAR ISRAELIS HAD DECIDED TO ""CHANGE THEIR COURSE TOWARDS THE ROAD TO DURABLE AND JUST PEACE"". FAHMY SAID THAT HIS PRESENCE IN GENEVA CONFIDENTIAL SYMBOLIZED EGYPTS DEEP DESIRE TO RESTORE REGION TO DURABLE AND JUST PEACE. ARAB COUNTRIES HAVE COME TO CONFERENCE ""READY AND PREPARED TO LAY THE CORNERSTONE OF THE EDIFICE OF PEACE IN THE MIDDLE EAST."" FAHMY SAID CHANCES OF REPEATING SUCH A HISTORICAL GATHERING WOULD BE REMOTE AND IF CONF DOES NOT SUCCEED, THERE WILL NO DOUBT BE ""RECOURSE TO OTHER MEANS"" BY ARABS TO LIBERATE THEIR LANDS AND TO RESTORE RIGHTS OF PALESTINIANS.\n5. FAHMY SAID HE VIEWED PARTICIPATION OF SOVIET UNION AND UNITED STATES IN COF AS ""A GOOD OMEN"" AND ""EVIDENCE OF THEIR WISH TO GUARANTEE THAT PEACEFUL AND JUST SETTLEMENT WILL PREVAIL IN MIDDLE EAST"". HE THEN LISTED FOLLOWING FIVE BASIC ""ESSENTIALS"" FOR PEACE:\n7.\n6. FAHMY CLOSED WITH STATEMENT THAT EGYPT IS PREPARED TO HONOR OBLIGATIONS EMANATING FROM RESOLUTION 242 AND WITH CALL FOR US AND USSR TO WORK FOR SUCCESS OF CONF.\n7. PRIME MINISTER RIFAI OF JORDAN LED OFF WITH A BRIEF HISTORICAL REVIEW CHARGING ISRAEL WITH MILITARY EXPANSION AND YET FAILING TO GAIN ACCEPTANCE IN WORLD. HE SAID IT WAS CLEAR THAT SC RES 242 ENDORSED RETURN OF ALL ARAB TERRITORIES OCCUPIED IN 1967, INCLUDING SYRIAN TERRITORY, THROUGH (A) ITS CONFIDENTIAL ENDORSEMENT PRINCIPLE OF INADMISSIBILITY OF ACQUISITION OF TERRITORY BY WAR AND (B) ITS CALL FOR ISRAELI WITHDRAWAL FROM THE (SIC) TERRITORIES OCCUPIED IN 1967. HE SAID IN JORDANS VIEW PRINCIPLE OF WITHDRAWAL IS INDIVISIBLE. RIFAI PROCEEDED TO IDENTIFY FOLLOWING SIX ISSUES IN ""CONSTRUCTION OF PEACE"":\n8. IN CONCLUSION, RIAFI SAID SOLUTION TO ME CONFLICT IS CONFIDENTIAL COMMON CONCERN AMONG ARAB STATES AND IS COLLECTIVE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THEM. JORDAN IS THEREFORE NOT PREPARED TO CONCLUDE ANY PARTIAL SETTLEMENT THAT IT FEELS IS OF JOINT INTEREST WITH OTHER ARABS AT CONFERENCE.\n9. EBAN GAVE ELOQUENT, CONSTRUCTIVE AND FOR MOST PART FORWARD-LOOKING SPEECH OF ABOUT 40 MINUTES DURATION-THE LONGEST OF THE DAY. STRESSED PEACE CONFERENCE WILL BE NEW OPPORTUNITY TO BREAK CYCLE OF VIOLENCE IN MIDDLE EAST. HE DID NOT KNOW IF IT WOULD SUCCEED IN THIS FORMIDABLE TASK, BUT PLEDGED ISRAELS BEST EFFORT. SAID TASK WOULD NOT BE EASY, AND IT WOULD BE UNREALISTIC TO EXPECT RAPID PROGRESS. ISRAEL COULD NOT IGNORE EXPERIENCE OF PAST, BUT ON OTHER HAND IT WOULD NOT ALLOW THAT EXPERIENCE TO PRODUCE DESPAIR.\n0. EBAN SAID CENTRAL QUESTION BEFORE THIS CONFERENCE WOULD BE WHETHER THE STATES CONCERNED COULD BREAK OUT OF OLD DEADLOCKS INTO ""NEW VISION"" OF PEACE FOR MIDDLE EAST. TO START WITH, IT WAS VITAL THAT CEASE-FIRE BE OBSERVED ON LAND, AIR AND SEA. EBAN INVITED CONFEREES TO COMMIT THEMSELVES ANEW TO OBSERVANCE OF CEASE-FIRE. THIS WAS INDISPENSABLE CONDITION FOR FURTHER NEGOTIATIONS. BEYOND THIS, ISRAELS GOAL WAS PEACE TREATY WHICH WOULD DEFINE TERMS OF ISRAELS EXISTENCE IN REGION IN FUTURE YEARS. SIMPLE EXTENSION OF CEASE-FIRE OR ARMISTICE WOULD NOT BE SUFFICIENT, NOR WOULD MERE ABSENCE OF WAR. NEITHER COULD PEACE SETTLEMENT REST ON DOCUMENTS ALONE. EBAN DEFINED ISRAELS GOAL AS CREATION OF ""COMMON REGIONAL INTERESTS OF SUCH INTENSITY"", AND ""SUCH ENTANGLEMENT OF MUTUAL ADVANTAGE"", AS TO PLACE RENEWAL OF WARFARE OUTSIDE OF REALM OF PROBABILITY.\n1. EBAN SAID PEACE TREATY SHOULD BE FREELY ARRIVED AT, SHOULD PUT AN END TO BOYCOTT AND BLOCKADE, PROVIDE FOR PREVENTION OF USE OF FORCE, PROHIBIT ANY HOSTILE ACTION, INCLUDING TERRORISM AND PROCLAIM PERMANENT END OF CONFLICT. EBAN SAID ISRAEL WILL SEEK TO LEARN FROM ARABS AT GENEVA WHETHER THEY SHARE ITS VISION OF PEACE; IF SO THERE WILL STILL BE MANY DIFFICULTIES BUT THE TASK WILL BE MUCH EASIER. DECISIVE TEST FOR ISRAEL, EBAN SAID, WILL BE DEFENSIBILITY OF ITS BOUNDARIES; THERE CANNOT BE RETURN TO FORMER BOUNDARIES OF 1967, ""WHICH SERVED AS TEMPTATION TO AGGRESSION"", BUT CONFIDENTIAL ISRAEL IS READY FOR CONCESSIONS WHICH DO NOT COMPROMISE SECURITY. OVERRIDING THEME OF PEACE CONFERENCE FOR ISRAEL, EBAN SAID, WILL BE SECURITY. ATTAINMENT OF PEACE WILL MAKE POSSIBLE SOLUTION OF REFUGEE PROBLEM THROUGH REGIONAL COOPERATION. ARAB REFUGEE PROBLEM NOT BASICALLY INTRACTABLE AND AT APPROPRIATE STAGE ISRAEL WILL DEFINE ITS CONTRIBUTION TO REFUGEE SOLUTION. EBAN SAID ISRAEL IS OPPOSED TO ""ANY EXPLOSIVE FRAGMENTATION"" OF AREAS BETWEEN MEDITERRANEAN AND DESERT. IN THIS REGION, HE SAID, THERE IS ROOM FOR ONLY TWO STATES, NOT THREE. RE JERUSALEM, EBAN SAID ISRAEL IS DEEPLY AWARE IT IS CRADLE OF TWO OTHER GREAT RELIGIONS AND DOES NOT WANT TO EXERCISE AUTHORITY OVER HOLY PLACES OF ISLAM AND CHRISTIANITY.\n2. EBAN SAID DISENGAGEMENT OF FORCES WAS LOGICAL FIRST TOPIC FOR CONFERENCE TO TAKE UP. HE SAID ABSENCE OF SYRIANS WAS REGRETTABLE, BUT COULD NOT SAY THAT SYRIA COULD QUALIFY FOR PEACE CONFERENCE AS LONG AS IT CONTINUED IN VIOLATION OF BASIC HUMAN DECENCIES. EBAN SAID 42 ISRAELI PRISONERS OF WAR HAD BEEN MURDERED IN COLD BLOOD BY SYRIANS. SAID OBLIGATIONS UNDER 3RD GENEVA CONVENTION WERE UNCONDITIONAL. IN SPITE OF ITS OUTRAGE AT THESE CRIMES, ISRAEL HAD NEVERTHELESS OFFERED SYRIANS EXCHANGE OF POWS, RETURN OF CIVILIANS TO TERRITORY OCCUPIED IN OCTOBER WAR, AND HANDING OVER TO UNEF OF TWO SYRIAN POSITIONS CAPTURED BY ISRAEL BETWEEN OCTOBER 22-24.\n3. EBAN EXPRESSED HOPE THAT IN NEXT STATE CONFERENCE WOULD ADOPT COMPACT, EFFECTIVE PROCEDURES THAT WOULD ENABLE BUSINESS-LIKE PROGRESS TO BE MADE. ISRAEL DID NOT RULE OUT POSSIBILITY OF AGREED, PHASED APPROACH TO PEACE SETTLEMENT BUT SAID CONFERENCE SHOULD NOT BE SATISFIED BY ANYTHING LESS THAN REAL PEACE AS ITS ULTIMATE OBJECTIVE. EBAN SAID ISRAEL ACCEPTED US AND SOVIET AUSPICES AS REALISTIC REFLECTION OF POWER STRUCTURE IN AREA. SAID HE UNDERSTOOD FROM GROMYKOS SPEECH THAT SOVIETS ACCEPTED ISRAELS EXISTENCE, BUT SAID LANGUAGE EMANATING FROM ALGERIAN SUMMIT MADE HIM LESS CERTAIN THAT ARABS HAD MADE SIMILAR COMMITMENT. EBAN CLOSED BY CALLING ON CONFERENCE TO PROVIDE MAXIMUM OPPORTUNITY FOR PARTIES THEMSELVES TO ENGAGE IN DIALOGUE SO THAT THEY COULD REACH ACCORD ON ISSUED DIVIDING THEM. CONFIDENTIAL 24.

explosive situation existing between Egypt and Israel                        as result of GOE insisting disengagement be                        settled in KM 101 forum prior to opening of                        peace conf GOE breaking off KM 101 talks Egyptian threatening order of                        battle and GOE intention stop Israeli ship                        from transitting BAM He stated Israel is                        prepared for worst but wants to avoid breakdown of ceasefire and will not                        take initiative to upset it Eban                        recalling his conversation with Secretary in WashingtonSee footnote 4 Document                                350 requested that US take urgent action with GOE UN and                        others as appropriate to hold the line on ceasefire to avoid a return to                        the polemics of the Security Council and to keep momentum going towards                        opening of peace conference as scheduled End summary1 At FonMin Ebans request I met with him today at 11:00 local at his                        home in Herzliya Also present were Evron MFA Gen Yariv DCM                        and DATT2 Eban opened conversation by stating                        PriMin Meir had asked him to review                        with me very serious situation which had developed as result of various                        Egyptian attitudes and actions which threaten to lead to destruction of                        ceasefire and resumption of largescale hostilities Yariv interjected that                        info lead Israelis to believe such a move could be taken Dec 5 or Dec 6                            Eban stated that he had just been                        informed that Egyptians were planning to prevent ship from Eilat from                        transitting BAM This made conversation                        even more urgent and situation could only be described as explosive3 At Ebans request Yariv reviewed                        latest meeting with Gamasy at                            KM 101See                                footnote 2 Document 364 Yariv                        said that in private conversation he told Gamasy that maintenance of ceasefire in land sea and air                        linked to continuing supply for Suez City and 3rd Army Yariv said he made                        no threats just a flat statement In reply Gamasy never suggested that the ceasefire might not hold at                            BAM Gamasy said he believed Yarivs statements that Israel                        wanted peace not resumption of hostilities and Gamasy said he had communicated this to                            Sadat In same conversation                        Yariv claims Gamasy agreed despite lack of progress                        on disengagement to meet again on SundayDecember 2 only to change his mind once he returned to tent                        obviously as result of being reminded of his instructions to break off                        talks4 Eban then read excerpts from                        telegram just received from Israeli Mission in UN re the Egyptian memo sent to Waldheim on November 30The                            Egyptian dmarche was in the form of a message from Foreign Minister                                Fahmi to Waldheim The text is in telegram 5280                            from USUN December 1 National                            Archives RG 59 Central Foreign Policy                            Files noting following points:A GOE decided to end all military                        contacts at KM 101B It clear from GOE and Siilasvuo contacts with Israelis that                            GOI used talks only to get back POWs                        and stalling on question of disengagementC GOE regards 6 points as inseparable                        package Israel cannot choose which points to implement and ignore                        otherD Question of disengagement is military matter and must be resolved before                        parties can meet in Geneva peace conference to discuss broader political                        matters5 Eban then passed on report received                        from Tekoah re Siilasvuo conversation with Egyptian                        warning Ismael along lines USUN 5260Telegram 5260 from USUN November 30 reported a conversation between Egyptian                            War Minister Ismael and General Siilasvuo in which Ismael charged that Israel never                            intended to reach an agreement in the KM                            101 talks Ismael wanted to hear Dayans comments before Egypt would consider resuming                            the talks Ibid He confirmed Siislasvuo would see Dayan tomorrow in Jerusalem and noted as a                        glimmer of hope Ismaels reported willingness to wait for results of this                        conversation before definitely shutting off KM 101 talks6 Eban noted that if asked 24 hours                        ago to give assessment of Egyptian policy he would have said GOE wanted to go to Geneva to negotiate in                        good faith After series of recent developments and he repeated concern                        about BAM GOI is uncertain as to what Egyptians really want and what they                        intend to do7 Eban reviewed his conversations in                        Washington with Secretary noting GOI had                        complied with Secy request that discussions on disengagement be postponed to                        Geneva In so doing GOI had also relied on                        Secy belief he could hold the line on the ceasefire and also avoid a                        return to the Security Council in the period before the opening of the conf                        Israel urgently requests the Secretarys appraisal of the US ability to                        deliver in view of the latest developments which indicate a change in                        Egyptian policy He asked that the US take action with the Egyptians                            UN and others presumably the USSR as appropriate in order to avoid a breakdown in the                        ceasefire and to continue the momentum towards Geneva8 Eban also noted that GOI was upset that Egyptians and UN were charging Israel with reneging on                        promises to negotiate in good faith at KM                        101 talks with widespread press play This not true and Israel now had to                        take some steps with press to correct this impression He added it would                        be useful if US could aid GOI in this                        effort to set record straight9 In our discussions with the Egyptians Eban asked that we emphasize that Israel does not want war                        In view of latest indications re Egyptian readiness to renew hostilities                        however Israel has to be and is prepared for war if necessary Eban reminded me that Israels original                        interest had been seriously to discuss disengagement at KM 101 if this is what is required to get the                        peace express back on the tracks Israel of course would be willing again                        to engage the Egyptians in such discussions in this forumComment: I assume we either are already or will soon                        be engaging in discussions

 a message to Fahmi urging that                            the Egyptian military representative return to the Kilometer 101 talks                            and promising that he would speak to the

Keating to assure Eban that he was sparing no effort with                            the Egyptians regarding staying on course for the peace conference and                            maintaining the ceasefire including urging noninterference with                            Israeli shipping through Bab alMandab He added that he hoped that                            Israel in correcting false impressions in the press regarding whether                            Israel was negotiating in good faith would avoid doing this in a                            provocative manner National Archives

IN INTERVIEW APPEARING DEC 28 MAARIV, ISRAELI NEGOTIATIOR AT KM 101 TALKYRN RES GEN AHARON YARIV, OUTLINED ISRAELI TERMS FOR DISENGAGEMENT OF FORCES. PERTINENT POINTS IN INTERVIEW ARE SUMMARIZED BELOW.\n2. NOTING THAT ISRAELI PRESENCE ON EGYPTS WEST BANK WAS LIKE BONE STUCK IN EGYPTIAN THROAT, YARIV SAID ISRAEL AGREES IN ADVANCE TO WITHDRAW WITHIN FRAMEWORK OF NEGOTIATIONS AND IN ORDER TO REACH PEACE SETTLEMENT BUT THAT "" DISENGAGEMENT MUST BE FIRMLY BOUND TO TERMS ACCEPTABLE TO US.""\n3. ASKED WHAT ISRAELI CONDITIONS FOR DISENGAGEMENT WERE, YARIV OUTLINED THEM IN FOLLOWING MANNER. FIRST, ISRAEL WANTED SOMETHING IT RETURN FOR WITHDRAWING FROM WEST BANK. "" WHEN WE ARE FORCED TO GIVE UP WHAT WE ACHIEVED ON THE BATTLEFIELD, WE WANT A RETURN FOR IT, WITH THE FINAL RETURN BEING PEACE."" YARIV THEN NOTED UNCLASSIFIED THAT DISTANCE ISRAEL WAS WILLING TO WITHDRAW FROM EAST BANK OF CANAL WAS MINIMAL "" SINCE A SETTLEMENT WITH EGYPT HAS TO BE BASED ON STAGES AND AT EACH STAGE WE MUST TEST EGYPTIAN INTENTIONS."" REGARDING DEPTH OF WITHDRAWAL, YARIV SAID ISRAEL MUST REMAIN WEST OF MITLA AND JIDDI PASSES AT THIS STAGE. SECOND CONDITION WAS ISRAELI UNWILLINGNESS TO ALLOW EGYPTIANS TROOPS TO REMAIN ON EAST BANK OF CANAL,  ""WHICH COULD ENDANGER OUR POSITIONS AND PROVIDE MILITARY PRESSURE FOR POLITICAL CONCESSIONS...THEY CAN MAINTAIN AN EGYPTIAN ADMINISTRATION BUT NOT KEEP ARMED FORCES ON THIS SIDE."" ISRAELS THIRD CONDITION, YARIV SAID, WAS ""ON WEST BANK WE ALSO DEMAND LIMITATIONS ON EGYPTIAN FORCES ON BASIS OF NUTUALITY...IN RETURN FOR LIMITATIONS ON EGYPTIAN WEST BANK FORCES, WE ARE READY TO LIMIT IDF TROOPS ON THE EAST BANK."" FINAL ISRAELI CONDITION WAS INSISTENCE THAT EGYPTIANS BEGIN CLEARING CANAL AND REHABI- LITATING CITIES ALONG SUEZ CANAL. "" THIS WILL BE PROOF THAT EGYPT WANTS PEACE SINCE THE CANAL IN OPERATION AND THESE TOWNS BACK TO LIFE ARE ANOTHER BARRIER TO WAR.""\n4. YARIV SAID THAT HE HAD MADE THESE CONDITIONS CLEAR TO GEN GAMASY DURING KM 101 TALKS. "" OUR WITHDRAWAL LINE IN THE DISENGAGE- MMENT TALKS IS NOT THE FINAL LINE. WE HAVE TO BE CONCERNED ABOUT YOUR (EGYPTS) MILITARY INITIATIVES, NOT THE OPPOSITE. THEREFORE WE HAVE TO PUT BARRIERS IN THE WAY OF THIS TEMPTATION. THE IDFS STRENGHTH IS ONE BARRIER.A UN FORCE ANOTHER. REDUCTION OF YOUR WEST BANK FORCES ANOTHER AND ALSO OUR MINIMAL WITHDRAWAL. EACH OF THESE MAKES IT HARDER TO BREAK THE CEASEFIRE AND IT IS LEGITIMATE FOR US TO DEMAND THESE."" ASKED WHETHER AS PART OF A DISENGAGEMENT AGREEMENT ISRAEL SHOULD INSIST THAT EGYPT ANNOUNCE A COMPLETE END TO STATE OF WAR, YARIV REPLIED AFFIRMATIVELY. ""GIVING UP A STATE OF WAR AND DEMILITARIZATION OF ANY AREA FROM WHICH WE WITHDRAW ARE CONDITIONS FOR THE COMPLETION OF THE BARRIERS TO ANOTHER WAR OR TO MILITARY PRESSURE DURING THE GENEVA TALKS.""\n5. ASKED ABOUT SUPERVISORY ARRANGEMENTS, YARIV SAID SUPERVISION MUST BE CARRIED OUT JOINTLY. IDF SHOULD BE PERMITTED TO PHOTO- GRAPH EYGPTIAN AREA AND VICE VERSA. SIZE AND LOCATION OF FORCES SHOULD BE SUPERVISED AND THERE SHOULD BE JOINT PATROLS AND JOINT OBSERVATION POINTS AT AGREED SPOTS. THER SHOULD BE DIRECT PHONE LINE BETWEEN LOCAL COMMANDERS AND REGULAR MEETINGS AT VARIOUS LEVELS BETWEEN OFFICERS IN FIELD. FINALLY, UN FORCE SHOULD NOT UNCLASSIFIED BE ALLOWED TO PREVENT THESE CONTACTS SINCE ""THUS WE WILL START ON THE LONG PROCESS OF MUTUAL RECOGNITION AND CONFIDENCE.""\n6. ASKED IF HE THOUGH IT WERE POSSIBLE FOR ISRAEL TO ACHIEVE THESE THINGS, YARIV RESPONDED THAT "" IT WONT BE EASY, BUT IT IS\n",693272

lines USUN 5260Telegram 5260 from USUN November 30 reported a conversation between Egyptian                            War Minister Ismael and General Siilasvuo in which Ismael charged that Israel never                            intended to reach an agreement in the KM                            101 talks Ismael wanted to hear Dayans comments before Egypt would consider resuming                            the talks Ibid He confirmed Siislasvuo would see Dayan tomorrow in Jerusalem and noted as a                        glimmer of hope Ismaels reported willingness to wait for results of this                        conversation before definitely shutting off KM 101 talks6 Eban noted that if asked 24 hours                        ago to give assessment of Egyptian policy he would have said GOE wanted to go to Geneva to negotiate in                        good faith After series of recent developments and he repeated concern                        about BAM GOI is uncertain as to what Egyptians really want and what they                        intend to do7 Eban reviewed his conversations in                        Washington with Secretary noting GOI had                        complied with Secy request that discussions on disengagement be postponed to                        Geneva In so doing GOI had also relied on                        Secy belief he could hold the line on the ceasefire and also avoid a                        return to the Security Council in the period before the opening of the conf                        Israel urgently requests the Secretarys appraisal of the US ability to                        deliver in view of the latest developments which indicate a change in                        Egyptian policy He asked that the US take action with the Egyptians                            UN and others presumably the USSR as appropriate in order to avoid a breakdown in the                        ceasefire and to continue the momentum towards Geneva8 Eban also noted that GOI was upset that Egyptians and UN were charging Israel with reneging on                        promises to negotiate in good faith at KM                        101 talks with widespread press play This not true and Israel now had to                        take some steps with press to correct this impression He added it would                        be useful if US could aid GOI in this                        effort to set record straight9 In our discussions with the Egyptians Eban asked that we emphasize that Israel does not want war                        In view of latest indications re Egyptian readiness to renew hostilities                        however Israel has to be and is prepared for war if necessary Eban reminded me that Israels original                        interest had been seriously to discuss disengagement at KM 101 if this is what is required to get the                        peace express back on the tracks Israel of course would be

explosive situation existing between Egypt and Israel                        as result of GOE insisting disengagement be                        settled in KM 101 forum prior to opening of                        peace conf GOE breaking off KM 101 talks Egyptian threatening order of                        battle and GOE intention stop Israeli ship                        from transitting BAM He stated Israel is                        prepared for worst but wants to avoid breakdown of ceasefire and will not                        take initiative to upset it Eban                        recalling his conversation with Secretary in WashingtonSee footnote 4 Document                                350 requested that US take urgent action with GOE UN and                        others as appropriate to hold the line on ceasefire to avoid a return to                        the polemics of the Security Council and to keep momentum going towards                        opening of peace conference as scheduled End summary1 At FonMin Ebans request I met with him today at 11:00 local at his                        home in Herzliya Also present were Evron MFA Gen Yariv DCM                        and DATT2 Eban opened conversation by stating                        PriMin Meir had asked him to review                        with me very serious situation which had developed as result of various                        Egyptian attitudes and actions which threaten to lead to destruction of                        ceasefire and resumption of largescale hostilities Yariv interjected that                        info lead Israelis to believe such a move could be taken Dec 5 or Dec 6                            Eban stated that he had just been                        informed that Egyptians were planning to prevent ship from Eilat from                        transitting BAM This made conversation                        even more urgent and situation could only be described as explosive3 At Ebans request Yariv reviewed                        latest meeting with Gamasy at                            KM 101See                                footnote 2 Document 364 Yariv                        said that in private conversation he told Gamasy that maintenance of ceasefire in land sea and air                        linked to continuing supply for Suez City and 3rd Army Yariv said he made                        no threats just a flat statement In reply Gamasy never suggested that the ceasefire might not hold at                            BAM Gamasy said he believed Yarivs statements that Israel                        wanted peace not resumption of hostilities and Gamasy said he had communicated this to                            Sadat In same conversation                        Yariv claims Gamasy agreed despite lack of progress                        on disengagement to meet again on SundayDecember 2 only to change his mind once he returned to tent                        obviously as result of being reminded of his instructions to break off                        talks4 Eban then read excerpts from                        telegram just received from Israeli Mission in UN re the Egyptian memo sent to Waldheim on November 30The                            Egyptian dmarche was in the form of a message from Foreign Minister                                Fahmi to

to get back POWs                        and stalling on question of disengagementC GOE regards 6 points as inseparable                        package Israel cannot choose which points to implement and

President Sadat: I have been following closely                        developments in the area and your role of leadership during these crucial                        days I know that you have just returned from a very important meeting with                        your Arab colleagues the results of which I believe reflect the hope and                        the desire of the overwhelming majority of the Arab worldindeed people from                        all corners of the earthfor a just and durable peace in the Middle East                        based on Security Council Resolution 2423 We are at an important stage Mr President and I hope all of us have the                        wisdom and the courage despite difficulties to stay on the course charted                        by you and Secretary Kissinger                        recently in Cairo4 We agree that the sixpoint agreement is a package We do not believe that                        certain elements can be implemented and others left to languish                        indefinitely However the disengagement proposals which Egyptian and                        Israeli military representatives have been discussing in recent weeks are                        farreaching This is the reason we have felt and have said honestly to                        you that final agreement was probably not possible

SUMMARY. YAR PRESIDENT EXPRESSES GRATIFICATION WITH US ECONOMIC ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS. CRITICIZES\n2. I CALLED ON PRESIDENT IRYANI DECEMBER 23 TO PAY RESPECTS FOR FORTHCOMING MOSLIM HOLIDAY. THIS BEING ALSO APPROXIMATELY THE ONE YEAR ANNIVERSARY OF MY PRESEN- TATION OF CREDENTIALS, I DELIVERED TO PRESIDENT A LETTER SUMMARIZING PROGRESS MADE IN U.S. ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS, DIRECT AND INDIRECT. I WARMLY PRAISED COOPERATION RECEIVED FROM YEMENI OFFICIALS PRINCIPALLY CONCERNED WITH DEVELOPMENT MATTERS AND EXPRESSED HOPE THAT WHATEVER    SECRET\n3. PRESIDENT EXPRESSED APPRECIATION FOR U.S. ASSISTANCE, NOTING WITH A SMILE AN ARAB PROVERB THAT QUOTE SUCCESS IS THE KEY TO MORE UNQUOTE. SAID HE REALIZED NEED FOR CONTINUITY IN DEVELOPMENT MINISTRIES AND INTENDED RETAIN KEY OFFICIALS IN PRESENT JOBS INDEFINITELY.\n4. PRESIDENT SWITCHED QUICKLY TO SUBJECT MOST ON HIS MIND: SECRETARY KISSINGERS VISIT TO MIDDLE EAST; GENEVA CONFERENCE AND PROSPECTS FOR PEACE. OBVIOUSLY REFLECTING HIS DISCUSSION THREE DAYS EARLIER WITH SYRIAN FONMIN KHADDAM (SANAA 2424), HE COMMENTED THERE COULD BE NO LASTING PEACE IN MIDDLE EAST THAT DID NOT TAKE INTO ACCOUNT CONCERNS OF SYRIA AND THE PALESTINIANS.\n5. I REPLIED THAT SYRIAS REFUSAL GO TO GENEVA MUCH TO BE REGRETTED.  IT SEEMED THAT SYRIA  STILL TRYING TO PLAY THE OLD GAME OF SEEKING COMMITMENT ON CONCESSIONS PRIOR TO NEGOTION. USG COMMITTED TO WORK FOR IMPLEMENTATION OF RESOLUTION 242 IN CONTEXT OF A NEGOTIATION. GENEVA WAS THE ARENA IN WHICH SYRIA COULD PRESS ITS INTERESTS. IF IT DID NOT GO, IT WAS UNLIKELY THESE INTERESTS WOULD BE ADVANCED. SADAT HAS APPRECIATED THIS FACT AND HAD GOTTEN OUT OF THE INITIAL MEETINGS ESTABLISHMENT OF A MILITARY WORKING GROUP TO STUDY DISENGAGEMENT OF FORCES. YEMENI RELATIONS WITH SYRIA WERE CLOSE AND I HOPED YEMEN WOULD USE ITS INFLUENCE IN EFFORT PERSUADE SYRIA TO JOIN.\n6. PRESIDENT SAID HE HAD TALKED TO KHADDAM IN THIS SENSE. HOWEVER, KHADDAM HAD SAID DR. KISSINGER HAD HELD OUT LITTLE HOPE FOR ISRAELI WITHDRAWAL IN GOLAN AND THUS SYRIA HAD DECIDED TI NOT WORTHWHILE TAKE THE DOMESTIC POLITICAL RISKS OF ATTENDANCE AT GENEVA. IF GENEVA DISCUSSIONS PRODUCED SOME FIRST STEPS IN ISRAELI WITHDRAWAL, SYRIA MIGHT BE PERSUADED RECONSIDER. YARG WOULD CONTINUE WORK AT THIS. (PRESIDENTIAL POLITICAL ADVISER) NUMAN SEEING KHADDAM IN DAMASCUS    SECRET\n7. PRESIDENT SAID PEACE IN MIDDLE EAST, WHICH ALL SENSIBLE ARABS WANTED, ONLY ACHIEVABLE BY CONTINUED U.S. LEADER- SHIP AND USE OF U.S. LEVERAGE ON ISRAEL. IN THIS REGARD, ARABS FELT IT UNFORTUNATE THAT JUST AS NEGOTIATIONS BEGINNING U.S. PROVIDING ISRAEL WITH MORE THAN TWO BILLION DOLLARS IN NEW MILITARY ASSISTANCE. THIS NOT LIKELY INDUCE ISRAELI FLEXIBILITY IN NEGOTIATION.\n8. I REPLIED THAT U.S. SUPPORT OF ISRAEL IS A FACT, BUT SO IS OUR DESIRE FOR FRIENDSHIP WITH ARABS. NO SINGLE ARMS OR AID TRANSACTION WILL DETERMINE THE OUT- COME OF NEGOTIATIONS. THAT IS A FUNCTION OF U.S. SUSTAINED DETERMINATION AND COMMITMENT TO THE SEARCH FOR AN EQUITABLE PEACE, AND OF ALL PARTIES WILLINGNESS COMPROMISE REALISTICALLY. DR. KISSINGERS TWO VISITS TO THE MIDDLE EAST REFLECTED USGS COMMITMENT AND DETERMINATION.\n9. PRESIDENT AGREED. HE SAID HE WAS VERY MUCH CONCERNED, HOWEVER, THAT RUSSIA PLAYING AN OPPORTUNISTIC GAME TO EXPAND TIS INFLUENCE IN AREA. IF U.S. ABLE BRING SYRIA AND PALESTINIANS INTO NEGOTIATIONS AND IF PEACE WERE ATTAINED, THIS DANGER WIOULD BE AVERTED. ARABS WANTED AMERICAN FRIENDSHIP.  WITH PEACE, ARAB STATES QUOTE FROM MOROCCO TO GULF WILL BE WITH YOU UNQUOTE.\n0. IN MORE PHILOSOPHICAL VEIN, PRESIDENT SAID THAT SADATS BEHAVIOR SINCE OCTOBER COULD MARK A TURNING POINT IN ARAB HISTORY. HE HAS LED EGYPT AWAY FROM EMPTY RHETORIC AND SELF-DELUSION. AN OVERWHELMING MAJORITY IN ARAB WORLD HAVE APPLAUDED. IF HE SUCCEEDS IN OBTAINING A JUST PEACE, THIS NEW REALISM CAN SPREAD TO    SECRET\n",681409

President Sadat: I have been following closely                        developments in the area and your role of leadership during these crucial                        days I know that you have just returned from a very important meeting with                        your Arab colleagues the results of which I believe reflect the hope and                        the desire of the overwhelming majority of the Arab worldindeed people from                        all corners of the earthfor a just and durable peace in the Middle East                        based on Security Council Resolution

you and Secretary Kissinger                        recently in Cairo4 We agree that the sixpoint agreement is a package We do not believe that                        certain elements can be implemented and others left to languish                        indefinitely However the disengagement proposals which Egyptian and                        Israeli military representatives have been discussing in recent weeks are                        farreaching This is the reason we have felt and have said honestly to                        you that final agreement was probably not possible before the peace                        conference I can assure you however that in our view the groundwork laid                        in the military representatives talks has not been in vain We

discussing in recent weeks are                        farreaching This is the reason we have felt and have said honestly to                        you that final agreement was probably not possible

GENEVA PEACE CONFERENCE OPENED WITH NO SURPRISES AT\n2. MORNING SESSION WAS DEVOTED ENTIRELY TO STATEMENTS BY WALDHEIM AND ALL FOREIGN MINISTERS EXCEPT EBAN, WHO SPOKE AT\n3. WALKEIMS OPENING STATEMENT WAS BRIEF AND BLAND. GROMYKO, WHO SPOKE NEXT, GAVE RELATIVELY SHORT AND RESTRAINED SPEECH, STATING STANDARD SOVIET CRITICISM OF ISRAEL AND SUPPORT FOR ARAB NEGOTIATING POSITIONS BUT INCLUDING MORE THAN USUAL EMPHASIS ON NEED TO ACCEPT ISRAELI SOVEREIGNTY AND RIGHT TO NATIONAL EXISTENCE. GROMYKO WAS FOLLOWED BY SECRETARY KISSINGER (FULL TEXT BY SEPTEL).\n4. ORIGINAL PLAN HAD BEEN FOR EGYPTIAN, JORDANIAN AND ISRAELI FOREIGN MINISTERS TO SPEAK AT SECOND OPEN SESSION SATURDAY MORNING, WITH FRIDAY AFTERNOON FREE FOR BILATERAL CONSULTATIONS. EGYPTIAN FOREIGN MINISTER FAHMY, HOWEVER, INSISTED ON SPEAKING FIRST DAY, AND AS CONSEQUENCE SO DID JORDANIAN AND ISRAELI.\n5. FAHMYS SPEECH, WHILE REAFFIRMING ALL STANDARD EGYPTIAN POSITIONS IN UNCOMPROMISING LANGUE, HAD MINIMUM OF RHETORIC AND REITERATED FREQUENTLY THAT EGYPTIAN OBJECTIVE IS PEACEFUL SETTLEMENT  RECOGNIZING SOVEREIGNTY OF ALL STATES IN AREA. JORDANIAN PRIME MINISTER AND FOREIGN MINISTER ZAID RIFAI, OBVIOUSLY WITH EYE TO PROTECTING FLANKS IN ARAB WORLD, GAVE CONSIDERABLY MORE HARD-LINE SPEECH THAN FAHMY, WITH EXTENSIVE ATTACKS ON ISRAEL AND MINIMAL EMPHASIS ON NEED FOR PEACEFUL SETTLEMENT.\n6. WHEN CONFERENCE RECONVENED FOR AFTERNOON SESSION, EBAN DELIVERED MODERATE SPEECH WHICH, WHIILE EXPRESSING SKEPTICISM CONFIDENTIAL RE ARAB INTENTIONS, CONSTITUTED ELOQUENT PLEA FOR RECON- CILIATION. IN ONLY EXERCISE OF RIGHT OF REPLY, FAHMY DELIVERED POLEMICAL, INTEMPERATE AND SOMEWHAT RAMBLING COMMENTARY ON EBANS SPEECK,ACCUSING EBAN AMONG OTHER THINGS OF PLAYING TO ISRAELI DOMESTIC OPINION IN ELECTORAL CAMPAIGN, WHILE HIMSELF OBVIOUSLY MAKING POINTS FOR ARAB HOME CONSUMPTION.\n7. BEFORE ADJOURNING AFTERNOON SESSION, WALDHEIM ANNOUNCED THERE WOULD BE CLOSED MEETING AT 11:00 AM SATURDAY, TO REVIEW WORKING PROCEDURES FOR CONFERENCE. GROMYKO INTERJECTED THAT HE ASSUMED QUESTIONS OF SUBSTANCE ALSO COULD BE RAISED, TO WHICH NO OBJECTIONS WERE RAISED.\n8. FOLLOWING ARE SUMMARIES OF SPEECHES AT TODAYS OPENING SESSION.\n9. WALDHEIM IN HIS OPENING REMARKS REMINDED CONFERENCE PARTI- CIPKKTS OF INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITYS CONCERN REGARDING SUCCESS OF THEIR UNDERTAKING AND POINTED OUT THAT SECURITY COUNCIL HAD EXPRESSED HOPE THAT CONFERENCE WOULD MAKE SPEEDY PROGRESS. UN HAS BEEN SEIZED OF MIDDLE EAST CONFLICT FOR PAST\n1. HE EXPRESSED HOPE THAT CONFERENCE WOULD MAKE PROGRESS ON DISENGAGEMENT, AND AT LATER STAGE ON PEACE, AND OFFERED UN ASSISTANCE IN ATTAINING THESE GOALS.\n0. GROMYKO FOLLOWED WITH RELATIVELY SHORT, RESTRAINED SPEECH. STRESSED DANGER THAT ARAB-ISRAELI CONFLICT PRESENTED TO REGIONAL, AS  WELL AS WORLD PEACE IF THE BASIS CAUSES OF DISPUTE WERE NOT RESOLVED. SAID ARABS WOULD NEVER AGREE TO LOSS OF THEIR TERRITORY THAT WAS OCCUPIED IN 1967, AND SOVIETS WLD GIVE THEM SUPPORT\n1. GROMYKO SAID MOST IMPORTANT PRINCIPLE IN APPROACH TO MIDDLE EAST PEACE IS THAT CITED IN S.C. RES. 242, VIZ. CONFIDENTIAL INADMISSIBILITY OF ACQUISITION OF TERRITORY BY WAR. AS LONG AS ISRAELI FORCES REMAINED ON ARAB TERRITORY, THERE WOULD BE NO PEACE. SAID ANY DOCUMENT DRAFTED BY THIS CONF SHOULD BE CLEAR-CUT DECLARATION TO ISRAEL TO VACATE OCCUPIED TERRITORY. WITHOUT THIS, CONF WOULD NOT PRODUCE RESULTS; WITH IT ALL OTHER PROBLEMS, INCLUDING THAT OF PALESTINIANS, COULD BE READILY RESOLVED.\n2. NOTING VERY EXISTENCE OF ISRAEL HAD BEEN BROUGHT ABOUT BY UN RESOLUTION, GROMYKO SAID IT WAS CLEAR THAT ALL STATES HAVE RIGHT TO EXISTENCE, BUT THIS COULD NOT BE ""UNILATERAL RIGHT"" WHICH IGNORED RIGHTS OF OTHERS. RIGHT OF EXISTENCE ENTAILED MUTUAL OBLIGATIONS WITH OTHER STATES. GROMYKO SAID SC RES. 242 STILL REPRESENTED REALISTIC APPROACH TO PEACE SETTLEMENT. CALLED ON CONF TO PRODUCE ""CONCRETE, REALISTIC PROPOSAL"" WHICH WOULD IMPLEMENT RES. 242. HE SAID AGREEMENT REACHED BETWEEN PARTIES SHOULD BE EMBODIED IN CONF DOCUMENTS, WHICH HE SAID SHOULD BE ""WEIGHTY"" DOCUMENTS, HAVING FORCE OF LAW. OBLIGATION THUS ASSUMED UNDER INTERNATIONAL LAW WOULD BE BEST GUARANTEE FOR MUTUAL SECURITY.IF ADDITIONAL GUARANTEES PROVED NECESSARY, USSR TAKING INTO ACCOUNT INTERESTS OF OTHER PARTIES, WOULD BE WILLING TO ACCEPT ADDITIONAL RESPONSIBILITY OF FURTHER GUARANTEES. HE SAID SECURITY COUNCIL WOULD ALSO HAVE ROLE ALONG THESE LINES WHICH COULD BE WORKED OUT IN THE NEGOTIATIONS.\n3. REFERRING AGAIN TO DANGERS OF RENEWED HOSTILITIES, GROMYKO NEVERTHELESS EXPRESSED HOPE CONF COULD PRODUCE RELIABLE PEACE. SAID SOVIET UNION WAS NOT HOSTILE TO ISRAEL PER SE, ONLY TO POLICY OF ANNEXATION. CONCLUDED BY SAYING SOVIET UNION WOULD DO EVERYTHING IN ITS POWER TO MAKE CONF SUCCEED AND SEE IT PROCEED IN CONSTRUCTIVE, EFFECTIVE MANNER.\n4. EGYPTIAN FOREIGN MINISTER FAHMY DELIVERED GENERALLY MODERATE ADDRESS. FAHMY SAID MIDDLE EAST HAS SUFFERED FROM MILITARISTIC AND EXPANSIONIST POLICY OF ISRAEL WHICH HAS SERIOUSLY ENDANGERED INDEPENDENCE AND TERRITORIAL INTEGRITY OF COUNTRIES IN AREA. HOWEVER, HE DID NOT WISH TO DWELL ON THIS. EGYPT HOPED THAT AS RESULT OF OCTOBER WAR ISRAELIS HAD DECIDED TO ""CHANGE THEIR COURSE TOWARDS THE ROAD TO DURABLE AND JUST PEACE"". FAHMY SAID THAT HIS PRESENCE IN GENEVA CONFIDENTIAL SYMBOLIZED EGYPTS DEEP DESIRE TO RESTORE REGION TO DURABLE AND JUST PEACE. ARAB COUNTRIES HAVE COME TO CONFERENCE ""READY AND PREPARED TO LAY THE CORNERSTONE OF THE EDIFICE OF PEACE IN THE MIDDLE EAST."" FAHMY SAID CHANCES OF REPEATING SUCH A HISTORICAL GATHERING WOULD BE REMOTE AND IF CONF DOES NOT SUCCEED, THERE WILL NO DOUBT BE ""RECOURSE TO OTHER MEANS"" BY ARABS TO LIBERATE THEIR LANDS AND TO RESTORE RIGHTS OF PALESTINIANS.\n5. FAHMY SAID HE VIEWED PARTICIPATION OF SOVIET UNION AND UNITED STATES IN COF AS ""A GOOD OMEN"" AND ""EVIDENCE OF THEIR WISH TO GUARANTEE THAT PEACEFUL AND JUST SETTLEMENT WILL PREVAIL IN MIDDLE EAST"". HE THEN LISTED FOLLOWING FIVE BASIC ""ESSENTIALS"" FOR PEACE:\n7.\n6. FAHMY CLOSED WITH STATEMENT THAT EGYPT IS PREPARED TO HONOR OBLIGATIONS EMANATING FROM RESOLUTION 242 AND WITH CALL FOR US AND USSR TO WORK FOR SUCCESS OF CONF.\n7. PRIME MINISTER RIFAI OF JORDAN LED OFF WITH A BRIEF HISTORICAL REVIEW CHARGING ISRAEL WITH MILITARY EXPANSION AND YET FAILING TO GAIN ACCEPTANCE IN WORLD. HE SAID IT WAS CLEAR THAT SC RES 242 ENDORSED RETURN OF ALL ARAB TERRITORIES OCCUPIED IN 1967, INCLUDING SYRIAN TERRITORY, THROUGH (A) ITS CONFIDENTIAL ENDORSEMENT PRINCIPLE OF INADMISSIBILITY OF ACQUISITION OF TERRITORY BY WAR AND (B) ITS CALL FOR ISRAELI WITHDRAWAL FROM THE (SIC) TERRITORIES OCCUPIED IN 1967. HE SAID IN JORDANS VIEW PRINCIPLE OF WITHDRAWAL IS INDIVISIBLE. RIFAI PROCEEDED TO IDENTIFY FOLLOWING SIX ISSUES IN ""CONSTRUCTION OF PEACE"":\n8. IN CONCLUSION, RIAFI SAID SOLUTION TO ME CONFLICT IS CONFIDENTIAL COMMON CONCERN AMONG ARAB STATES AND IS COLLECTIVE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THEM. JORDAN IS THEREFORE NOT PREPARED TO CONCLUDE ANY PARTIAL SETTLEMENT THAT IT FEELS IS OF JOINT INTEREST WITH OTHER ARABS AT CONFERENCE.\n9. EBAN GAVE ELOQUENT, CONSTRUCTIVE AND FOR MOST PART FORWARD-LOOKING SPEECH OF ABOUT 40 MINUTES DURATION-THE LONGEST OF THE DAY. STRESSED PEACE CONFERENCE WILL BE NEW OPPORTUNITY TO BREAK CYCLE OF VIOLENCE IN MIDDLE EAST. HE DID NOT KNOW IF IT WOULD SUCCEED IN THIS FORMIDABLE TASK, BUT PLEDGED ISRAELS BEST EFFORT. SAID TASK WOULD NOT BE EASY, AND IT WOULD BE UNREALISTIC TO EXPECT RAPID PROGRESS. ISRAEL COULD NOT IGNORE EXPERIENCE OF PAST, BUT ON OTHER HAND IT WOULD NOT ALLOW THAT EXPERIENCE TO PRODUCE DESPAIR.\n0. EBAN SAID CENTRAL QUESTION BEFORE THIS CONFERENCE WOULD BE WHETHER THE STATES CONCERNED COULD BREAK OUT OF OLD DEADLOCKS INTO ""NEW VISION"" OF PEACE FOR MIDDLE EAST. TO START WITH, IT WAS VITAL THAT CEASE-FIRE BE OBSERVED ON LAND, AIR AND SEA. EBAN INVITED CONFEREES TO COMMIT THEMSELVES ANEW TO OBSERVANCE OF CEASE-FIRE. THIS WAS INDISPENSABLE CONDITION FOR FURTHER NEGOTIATIONS. BEYOND THIS, ISRAELS GOAL WAS PEACE TREATY WHICH WOULD DEFINE TERMS OF ISRAELS EXISTENCE IN REGION IN FUTURE YEARS. SIMPLE EXTENSION OF CEASE-FIRE OR ARMISTICE WOULD NOT BE SUFFICIENT, NOR WOULD MERE ABSENCE OF WAR. NEITHER COULD PEACE SETTLEMENT REST ON DOCUMENTS ALONE. EBAN DEFINED ISRAELS GOAL AS CREATION OF ""COMMON REGIONAL INTERESTS OF SUCH INTENSITY"", AND ""SUCH ENTANGLEMENT OF MUTUAL ADVANTAGE"", AS TO PLACE RENEWAL OF WARFARE OUTSIDE OF REALM OF PROBABILITY.\n1. EBAN SAID PEACE TREATY SHOULD BE FREELY ARRIVED AT, SHOULD PUT AN END TO BOYCOTT AND BLOCKADE, PROVIDE FOR PREVENTION OF USE OF FORCE, PROHIBIT ANY HOSTILE ACTION, INCLUDING TERRORISM AND PROCLAIM PERMANENT END OF CONFLICT. EBAN SAID ISRAEL WILL SEEK TO LEARN FROM ARABS AT GENEVA WHETHER THEY SHARE ITS VISION OF PEACE; IF SO THERE WILL STILL BE MANY DIFFICULTIES BUT THE TASK WILL BE MUCH EASIER. DECISIVE TEST FOR ISRAEL, EBAN SAID, WILL BE DEFENSIBILITY OF ITS BOUNDARIES; THERE CANNOT BE RETURN TO FORMER BOUNDARIES OF 1967, ""WHICH SERVED AS TEMPTATION TO AGGRESSION"", BUT CONFIDENTIAL ISRAEL IS READY FOR CONCESSIONS WHICH DO NOT COMPROMISE SECURITY. OVERRIDING THEME OF PEACE CONFERENCE FOR ISRAEL, EBAN SAID, WILL BE SECURITY. ATTAINMENT OF PEACE WILL MAKE POSSIBLE SOLUTION OF REFUGEE PROBLEM THROUGH REGIONAL COOPERATION. ARAB REFUGEE PROBLEM NOT BASICALLY INTRACTABLE AND AT APPROPRIATE STAGE ISRAEL WILL DEFINE ITS CONTRIBUTION TO REFUGEE SOLUTION. EBAN SAID ISRAEL IS OPPOSED TO ""ANY EXPLOSIVE FRAGMENTATION"" OF AREAS BETWEEN MEDITERRANEAN AND DESERT. IN THIS REGION, HE SAID, THERE IS ROOM FOR ONLY TWO STATES, NOT THREE. RE JERUSALEM, EBAN SAID ISRAEL IS DEEPLY AWARE IT IS CRADLE OF TWO OTHER GREAT RELIGIONS AND DOES NOT WANT TO EXERCISE AUTHORITY OVER HOLY PLACES OF ISLAM AND CHRISTIANITY.\n2. EBAN SAID DISENGAGEMENT OF FORCES WAS LOGICAL FIRST TOPIC FOR CONFERENCE TO TAKE UP. HE SAID ABSENCE OF SYRIANS WAS REGRETTABLE, BUT COULD NOT SAY THAT SYRIA COULD QUALIFY FOR PEACE CONFERENCE AS LONG AS IT CONTINUED IN VIOLATION OF BASIC HUMAN DECENCIES. EBAN SAID 42 ISRAELI PRISONERS OF WAR HAD BEEN MURDERED IN COLD BLOOD BY SYRIANS. SAID OBLIGATIONS UNDER 3RD GENEVA CONVENTION WERE UNCONDITIONAL. IN SPITE OF ITS OUTRAGE AT THESE CRIMES, ISRAEL HAD NEVERTHELESS OFFERED SYRIANS EXCHANGE OF POWS, RETURN OF CIVILIANS TO TERRITORY OCCUPIED IN OCTOBER WAR, AND HANDING OVER TO UNEF OF TWO SYRIAN POSITIONS CAPTURED BY ISRAEL BETWEEN OCTOBER 22-24.\n3. EBAN EXPRESSED HOPE THAT IN NEXT STATE CONFERENCE WOULD ADOPT COMPACT, EFFECTIVE PROCEDURES THAT WOULD ENABLE BUSINESS-LIKE PROGRESS TO BE MADE. ISRAEL DID NOT RULE OUT POSSIBILITY OF AGREED, PHASED APPROACH TO PEACE SETTLEMENT BUT SAID CONFERENCE SHOULD NOT BE SATISFIED BY ANYTHING LESS THAN REAL PEACE AS ITS ULTIMATE OBJECTIVE. EBAN SAID ISRAEL ACCEPTED US AND SOVIET AUSPICES AS REALISTIC REFLECTION OF POWER STRUCTURE IN AREA. SAID HE UNDERSTOOD FROM GROMYKOS SPEECH THAT SOVIETS ACCEPTED ISRAELS EXISTENCE, BUT SAID LANGUAGE EMANATING FROM ALGERIAN SUMMIT MADE HIM LESS CERTAIN THAT ARABS HAD MADE SIMILAR COMMITMENT. EBAN CLOSED BY CALLING ON CONFERENCE TO PROVIDE MAXIMUM OPPORTUNITY FOR PARTIES THEMSELVES TO ENGAGE IN DIALOGUE SO THAT THEY COULD REACH ACCORD ON ISSUED DIVIDING THEM. CONFIDENTIAL 24.

exercised by both                        sides so that all aspects of the situation can be discussed in the spirit                        which prevailed in his first talk with you We will of course similarly                        counsel restraint in our discussions with the Israelis Sincerely Richard Nixon End                            text9 You may convey foregoing message through Foreign

THERE FOLLOWS VERBATIME ADVANCE TEXT (UNNECESSARY WORDS OMITTED) OF PRIMIN MEIRS SPEECH DEC 20 BEFORE KNESSET, EXCEPT FOR FIRT THREE PARAGRAPHS WHICH WE HAVE SUMMARIZED.\n2. AFTER ENTAILING VIRTUES OF CEASEFIRE STABILIAZTION AGREEMENT OF NOV 11 AND KM 101 TALKS, MRS MEIR CONTINUED: BEGIN TEXT. THE TALKS HAVE BEEN BROKEN OFF, TO OUR GREAT REGRET, BUT NEED TO STABILIZE CEASEFIRE BY SEPARATION OF FORCES REMAINED. WE EXPRESSED OUR READINESS TO RESUME DISCUSSION OF SUBJECT WHEN PEACE CONFERENCE CONVENES, IN HOPE OF REACHING AN AGREE- MENT. BREAKING- OFF OF TALKS AT KM 101 ON EGYPTS INITIATIVE MADE IT NECESSARY TO EXERCISE REDOUBLED ALERTNESS IN MILITARY AREA, IN VIEW OF POSSIBILITY OF AGRESSIVE MOVES ON PART OF EGYPT. UNCLASSIFIED 3. REGRETTABLY DESPITE EGYPTIAN GOVERNMENTS COMMITMENT TO CEASEFIRE, BREACHES OF CEASEFIRE OCCUR ALMOST EVERY DAY THROUGH FIRE FROM EGYPTIAN ARMY POSITIONS TOWARDS OUR FORCES. HUNDREDS OF SUCH INCIDENTS HAVE TAKEN PLACE SINCE OCT 24, AND THER HAVE EVEN BEEN CASUALTIES. ON THIS OCCASION, I CALL UPON EGYPTIAN AUTHORITIES TO COMPLY WITH THEIR OBLIGATION TO OBSERVE CEASEFIRE-- TO PUT SAFETY-CATCH ON THEIR ARMS.\n4. ALL THIS TIME, US SECRETARY OF STATE KISSINGER, HAS BEEN CONTINUING HIS EFFORTS TO GET AGREEMENT FROM PARTIES CONCERNED TO TAKE PART IN PEACE CONFERENCE BETWEEN OURSELVES AND OUR NEIGHBORS. IN COURSE OF HIS EFFORTS, HE HAS VISITED ARAB CAPITALS AND CAPITAL OF ISRAEL. IN OUR TALKS IN JERUSALEM, FOLLOW- ING UPON MY TALKS WITH HIM IN WASHINGTON, I DISCUSSED WITH SECRETARY OF STATE IMPORTANH ISSURES IN CONNECTION WITH CONFERENCE. QUESTION OF AUSPICES FOR CONFERENCE, STATES WHOSE REPRESENTATIVES WOULD BE INVITED, STAGES OF DISCUSSIONS, AND SO FORTH, WERE DISCUSSED. WE ALSO HELD DETAILED DISCUSSION ON QUESTION OF SEPARATION OF FORCES, AND ISSUE WHICH DR KISSINGER WISHED TO STUDY THOROUGHLY IN CONTACTS WITH AUTHORITIES OF EGYPT AND ISRAEL. THIS DISCUSSION HAS NOT YET BEEN COMPLETED.\n5. SPONSORS OF CONFERENCE--UNITED STATES AND SOVIET UNION-- HAD INTENDED TO CONVENE IT ON DEC 18, BUT THEY HAD TO COMMUNI- CATE WITH GOVERNMENTS CONCERNING THEIR LETTER TO UN SECRETARY GENERAL, WHO IS CONVENING CONFERENCE. AS A RESULT OF THESE DISCUSSIONS WITH THE PARTIES--ISRAEL INCLUDED--THERE WAS A POSTPONEMENT. IN LETER FROM US AND USSR TO UN SECRETARY GENERAL, DATED DEC 18, 1973, WHICH WAS COMPOSED FOLLOWING DELIBERATIONS WITH THE PARTIES, IT IS STATED: (VERBATIM TEXT OF SYGS LETTER OF INVITATION AS CONTAINED USUN 5704 FOLLOWS.)\n6. US SECRETARY OF STATE ATTACHED SUPREME IMPORTANCE TO OPENING CONFERENCE WITHIN MONTH OF DECEMBER. IT APPEARS TO ME THAT HE WAS ANXIOUS OVER POSSIBILITY OF ANY POSTPONEMENT, LEST OBSTACLES CROPPED UP AND POSSIBLY EVEN FIRING WAS RESUMED. WE TOO, FOR OUR PART, WERE NOT INTERESTED INDELAYS OR POSTPONE- MENTS FOR VERY SAME REASONS. OUR FORCES ARE DEPLOYED AGAINST ANY AGGRESSIVE INITIATIVE BY EGYPT OR SYRIA, BUT WE DO NOT WANT RESUMPTION OF WAR. UNCLASSIFIED 7. ISRAEL AGREEMENT WAS, THEREFORE, GIVEN TO OPENING OF CONFERENCE IN DECEMBER, PROVIDED SUBSTATIVE DISCUSSIONS ON VARIOUS ASPECTS OF SUBJECT OF PEACE ARE HELD AT LATER DATE, AFTER ELECTIONS TO EIGHT KNESSET, AND ARE CONDUCTED ON RESPONSIBILITY OF A CABINET WHICH SHALL HAVE RECEIVED CONFIDENCE OF NEW KNESSET. I AM HAPPY TO NOTE THAT THIS CONDI- TION OF OURS HAS BEEN ACCEPTED. CONFERENCE WILL OPEN TOMORROW, FRIDAY, DEC 21, 1973, BEFORE KNESSET ELECTIONS, BUT INITIAL STAGE WILL BE BRIEF AND FORMAL ONLY AND WILL LAST TWO DAYS. AT OPENING CEREMONY, ADDRESSES WILL BE DELIVERED BY FOREIGN MINISTERS OF INVITED STATES, AS WELL AS FOREIGN MINISTERS OF UNITED STATES AND SOVIET UNION AND SECRETARY GENERAL OF UNITED NATIONS. THERE WILL BE AN INTERVAL THEREAFTER, AND CONFERENCE WILL BE RESUMED IN COURSE OF JANUARY.\n8. AS AFORSAID, CONFERENCE STARTS TOMORROW, AND MUCH TO OUR REGRET, DESPITE ALL OUR EFFORTS TO ENSURE THAT THERE WILL BE NO SESSIONS ON SABBATH, NO WAY WAS FOUND TO CHANGE TIMING DETERMINED, AND IT WILL INDEED CONTINUE ALSO ON SATURDAY, DEC 22, 1973.\n9. OPENING STAGE WILL LAST ONLY TWO DAYS, BUT DURING THIS SHORT PERIOD ARRANGEMENTS AND PROCEDURES WILL BE DETERMINED WHICH WILL INFLUENCE ENTIRE COURSE OF CONFERENCE, AND IT DOES NOT APPEAR FEASIBLE TO ME THAT WE CAN AFFORD TO BE ABSENT FROM HALF THE TIME OF DISCUSSIONS. MINISTER FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS ANNOUNCED AT CABINET SESSION THAT ISRAELS REPRESENTATIVES WHO WILL BE COMPELLED-- IN THIS GIVEN SITUATION-TO PARTICIPATE IN DISCUSSIONS ON SATURDAY, WILL, OF COURS, SCRUPULOUSLY REFRAIN FROM DESE- CRATING SABBATH.\n0. ALMOST CERTAINLY, FIRST MATTER TO BE DEALT WITH BY CONFERENCE IN JANUARY 1974 WILL BE DISENGAGEMENT OF FORCES, WHICH IS PART OF CEASEFIRE AGREEMENT (ARTICLE 2 OF SIX-POINT AGREEMENT). I HAVE NOTED THAT PRESIDENT SADAT HAS SAID PUBLICLY THAT HE ALSO IS PREPARED TO MAKE PROGRESS IN DISCUSSIONS ON THIS SUBJECT, AND WE SHALL BE PREPARED TO TAKE PART IN THESE DISCUSSIONS EVEN BEFORE NEW GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN FORMED. AS I HAVE SAID, PRINCI- PAL STAGE OF CONFERENCE WILL BEGIN AND CONTINUE ACCORDING TO DIRECTIVES OF NEW GOVERNMENT. UNCLASSIFIED UNCLASSIFIED\n1. IN ORAL AND WRITTEN CONTACTS WITH PRESIDENT OF UNITED STATES, MR RICHARD NIXON, AND SECRETARY OF STATE, DR KISSINGER, MAIN CONDITIONS AND POLITICAL FRAMEWORK FOR CONVENING OF CONFERENCE HAVE BEEN THOROUGHLY CLARIFIED. IN COURSE OF THESE CONTACTS, WE HAVE AGREED TO DEFINITION OF FUNCTION OF UNITED NATIONS. FUNCTION ALLOTTED TO UN HAS BEEN THOROUGHLY CLARIFIED: AUSPICES OF UN ARE LIMITED TO CONVENING OF CONFERENCE. UN SECRETARY GENERAL, DR WALDHEIM, WILL SERVE AS CONVENER OF CONFERENCE AND CHAIRMAN AT ITS OPENING SESSION. UN SECRETARY GENERAL DISPATCHED INVITATIONS AT REQUEST OF US AND USSR, IN THEIR LETTER WHICH I HAVE ALREADY MENTIONED. HE WILL ENSURE THAT UN ORGANIZATION WILL PLACE AT DISPOSAL OF CONFERENCE SERVICES REQUIRED FOR EFFECTIVE WORKING.\n2. ON DEC 15, SECURITY COUNCIL ADOPTED DISTURBING RESOLU- TION IN REFERENCE TO PEACE CONFERENCE. FOUR OF PERMANENT MEMBERS, INCLUDING US AND USSR, ABSTAINED. LET US RECALL THAT ISRAEL HAS NO DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS WITH FIVE OUT OF TEN STATES THAT VOTED FOR RESOLUTION. I MUST MAKE IT CLEAR THAT ANY ATTEMPT TO INCLUDE SUB- JECTS OF DISCUSSIONS AT PEACE CONFERENCE WITHIN ACTIVITY AND AUTHORITY OF SECURITY COUNCIL WILL BE IN DANGEROUS CONTRADICTION TO BASIS AND PURPOSE OF CONFERENCE, AND WILL MEET WITH EXPLICIT UNCLASSIFIED OPPOSITION ON OUR PART. IT IS INCONCEIVABLE THAT US SHOULD ACQUIESCE IN SUCH A BREACH OF AGREED ASSUMPTIONS. WE SHALL NOT FIND OURSELVES ISOLATED IN FACING SUCH A DANGEROUS MOVE, WHICH VIOLATES CONSENT WHICH IS BASIS OF PEACE CONFERENCE.\n3. ARAB STATES WHICH HAVE BEEN INVITED TO TAKE PART IN CONFERENCE ARE EGYPT, JORDAN AND SYRIA, LEBANON HAS NOT YET BEEN INVITED, BUT I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT IT WILL BE INVITED AT LATER STAGE. EGYPT AND JORDAN HAVE ACCEPTED INVITATION, WHILE SYRIA HAS REPLIED IN NEGATIVE.\n4. WITH GREAT REGRET I HAVE TO INFORM HOUSE THAT SYRIAN RULERS STILL REPLY WITH FLAT REFUSAL TO OUR DEMAND FOR LIBERATION OF OUR PRISONERS. ON OUR PART PROPOSALS HAVE BEEN MADE TO THEM WHICH ARE BEYOND LIMITS OF OUR COMMITMENTS-- BUT IN VAIN. INFLUENTIAL POLITICAL ELEMENTS HAVE REPEATEDLY APPEALED TO SYRIAN RULERS--WITHOUT EFFECT. PRESIDENT OF SYRIA, WHO WAS ASKED TO DISCUSS SUBJECT OF PRISONERS, STATED THAT FROM HUMANITARIAN ASPECT THIS WAS NOT SUBJECT REQUIRING PARTICULAR DISCUSSION. AND NOW SYRIANS HAVE DECLARED THAT THEY WILL NOT BE COMING TO GENEVA.\n5. I DO NOT KNOW HOW SYRIANS EXPLAIN THEIR REFUSAL TO TAKE PART IN PEACE CONFERENCE. EVEN BEFORE THEY CAME OUT WITH THIS STATEMENT WE MADE IT CLEAR- BOTH FROM KNESSET ROSTRUM AND TO REPRESENTATIVES OF US- THAT AS LONG AS NO LIST OF OUR PRISONERS IS RECEIVED BY US AND RED CROSS IS NOT PERMITTED TO VISIT THEM, WE CANNOT SIT DOWN WITH THEM AT GENEVA CONFERENCE AT ANY STAGE.\n6. WE TRIED  TO MAKE CONTACT WITH SYRIANS THROUGH REPRESENTA- TIVES OF US AND OF REDCROSS. THROUGH US REPRESENTATIVE WE LEARNED OF SYRIAN PROPSOAL THAT WE AGREE TO RETURN OF 15,000 SYRIAN CITIZENS TO AREAS CAPTURED BY IDF IN YOM KIPPUR WAR, AND TO RETURN TWO SYRIAN POSITONS ON MT. HERMON. IF WE COMPLIED THERE WOULD BE AN EXCHANGE OF PRISONERS. WE AGREED TO RETURN OF CIVILIANS AND TO STATIONING OF UN FORCES IN TWO POSITIONS REFERRED TO. WHAT IS MORE, IN MY TALK WITH DR. GUYER, ASSISTANT SECRETARY-GENERAL OF UN, I PROPOSED THAT MEETING BETWEEN SENIOR ISRAELI AND SYRIAN OFFICERS BE HELD, SIMILAR TO KILOMETER 101. WE DIDNOT UNCLASSIFIED RECEIVE ANY AFFIRMATIVE REPLY.\n7. I REALIZE AND UNDERSTAND WHAT MUST BE FEELINGS OF FAMILIES WHOSE DEAR ONES HAVE BEEN TAKEN PRISONER BY SYRIANS. ALL OF US ARE AGHAST AT DREADFUL NEWS AND RUMOURS WHICH HAVE REACHED US. WE SHALL NOT CEASE IN OUR EFFORTS TO SECURE INTER- VENTION OF FACTORS WHICH CAN SPEED UP LIBERATION OF OUR SOLDIERS. SYRIAN RULERS ARE ASSUMING TERRIBLE RESPONSIBILITY, AND WE WILL NOT EXEMPT THEM FROM THIS RESPONSIBILITY.\n8. NEGOTIATIONS ON PEACE IN MIDDLE EAST MUST BE CONDUCTED BETWEEN STATES CONCERNED: NAMELY, BETWEEN ISRAEL ON ONE HAND AND ISRAELS NEIGHBOURS-EGYPT, JORDAN, SYRIA AND LEBANON- ON THE OTHER. THERE IS NO REASON TO INVITE TO PARTICIPATE IN THESE NEGOTIATIONS ANY ADDITIONAL STATES BESIDES US AND USSR, WHICH UNDERTOOK SPONSORSHIP OF CONFERENCE. THERE IS NO CONCEIVABLE OBJECTIVE CRITERION BY WHICH ADDITIONAL STATES SHOULD BE INVITED. WE ARE AWARE OF FACT THAT REPRESENTATIVES OF VARIOUS STATES HAVE EXPRESSED THEIR WISH TO TAKE PART IN CONFERENCE. THIS INCLUDES STATES NOT OUTSTANDING IN THEIR NEUTRALITY. ISRAEL GOVENMENT HAS EXPRESSED ITS OPPOSITION TO INVITATION OF ADDITIONAL STATES OR OF NON-SOVEREIGN FACTORS, AND WE ARE CONVINCED THAT BY THIS OPPOSITION WE ARE SAFEGUARDING CONFERENCE AGAINST DANGEROUS COMPLICATIONS.\n9. IT IS ONLY NATURAL THAT WE SHOULD HAVE VOICED OUR EXPLICIT OPPOSITION TO ANY NOTION OF INVITING TERRORIST ORGANIZATIONS UNDER THE AEGIS OF PLO OR ANY OTHER ORGANIZATION, AT ANY STAGE WHATSOEVER. IT IS INCONCEIVABLE THAT WE SHOULD AGREE TO TAKE PART IN CONFERENCE TO WHICH REPRESENTATIVES OF THESE ORGANIZATIONS SHOULD BE INVITED, NOT TO SPEEK OF NEGOTIATING WITH REPRESENTATIVES OF ORGANIZATIONS WHOSE DECLARED AIM IS DESTRUCTION OF STATE OF ISREL. WE HAVE NO COMMON DENOMINATOR WITH ORGANIZATINS THAT ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR ACTS OF TERRORISM AND MURDER. WE SHALL NEGOTIATE WITH REPRESENTATIVES OF NEIGHBOURING STATES, WITH WHICH WE HAVE CEASE-FIRE AGREEMENTS.\n0. WE ARE NOT IGNORING DISTURBING FACT THAT ONE OF POWERS UNDER WHOSE AUSPICES CONFERENCE IS MEETING HAS SEVERED DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS WITH ISRAEL. THIS POWER PLAYED CONSIDERABLE PART IN DEVELOPING ARAB MILITARY STRENGTH AND IN PREPARING EGYPT AND SYRIA FOR WAR.IN COURSE OF CONFERENCE, IT WILL BECOME CLEAR WHETHER THIS POWER IS ACUALLY CONDUCTING ITSELF IN MANNER FITTING TO AIM OF PEACE CONFERENCE.\n1. I AM CONVINCED THAT POLICY OF US AT PEACE CONFERENCE WILL BE GUIDED BY SONCERE GOODWILL AND WILL BE DESIGNED TO OFFER AID TO PARTIES, AS REQUIRED,D IN ORDER TO BRING ABOUT SUCCESSFUL CONCLUSION OF NEGOTIATIONS AND ACHIEVE CONTRACTUAL AND BINDING PEACE TREATY.\n2. ROLE FULFILLED BY US SINCE OCTOBER 6 AND UNTIRING EFFORTS OF SECRETARY OF STATE KISSINGER IN CAIRO, AMMAN AND OTHER ARAB CAPITALS HAVE BEEN OF NO SMALL ASSISTANCE TO CESSATION OF HOSTILITIES AND TO ACHIEVEMENT OF SIX-POINT AGREEMENT REPRESENTING LOGICAL AND OPERATIONAL CONTINUATION OF THE SECURITY COUNCILS CEASE-FIRE RESOLUTION. WE ARE ENCOURAGED BY CLEAR-CUT STAND OF US, AS FREQUENTLY EXPRESSED IN PUBLIC, IN FAVOUR OF DIRECT NEGOTIATIONS BETWEEN PARTIES. UNCLASSIFIED WITH HELP OF THIS CLEAR-CUT POLICY, WE HOPE TO ACHIEVE SIGNIFICANT AND DIRECT NEGOTIATIONS WITH EACH OF ARAB STAES BORDERING UPON ISRAEL, AND TO ADVANCE TOWARDS SETTLEMENT OF QUESTIONS IN DISPUTE.\n3. WE ATTACH SUPREME IMPORANCE TO WHAT IS STATED IN SC RE 338 ON SUBJECT OF NEGOTIATIONS. THIS TIME THERE IS EXPLICIT REFERENCE TO NEGOTIATIONS BETWEEEN PARTIES: UP TO THAT POINT THERE HAD BEEN NO LACK OF ATTEMPTS AT MEDIATION, SPONSORSHIP AND GOOD MFFICES, ALL OF THEM WITHOUT DIRECT NEGOTIATIONS. ISRAEL WILL BE ON WATCH THAT NO MISINTERPRETATION SHALL ARISE ON THIS PMINT, WHICH IS POSITIVE AND SIGNIFICANT INNOVATION IN SECURITY COUNCIL RESOLUTION 338.\n4. GOVERNMENT OF ISRAEL WILL SEND IT AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVES TO PEACE CONFERENCE WITH CLEAR CUT DIRECTIVES TO MAKE EVERY EFFORT TO ADVANCE TOWARDS AND ATTAIN PEACE. SUBSTANTIVE DIRECTIVES WILL BE ISSURE BY NEW GOVERMENT, AND I DO NOT TAKE IT UPON MYSELF TO DEFINE NOW ITS ATTITUDES ON MAJOR POINTS AT ISSURE. HOWEVER, I HOPE AND BELIEVE THAT NEW GOVERN- MENT TO BE ESTABLISHED BY EIGHTH KNESSET AFTER ELECTIONS WILL EXPRESS OUR PEOPLES YEARNINGS OF PEACE WITHIN DEFENSIBLE BORDERS.\n5. ON THRESHHOLD OF CONFERENCE, I SHALL MAKE NO ATTEMPT TO EXAMINE ATTITUES OF GOVERNMENTS OF ARAB STATES. THERE WILL BE TIME FOR THIS IN COURSE OF DISCUSSIONS AT CONFERENCE. INFLU- ENCE OF ALGIERS CONFERENCE, ITS DELIBERATIONS AND RESOLUTIONS, CANNOT BUT GIVE RISE TO CONCERN. HOWEVER, WE SHALL NOT CEASE TO HOPE FOR A TURNING POINT, A NEW APPROACH, FOR THROWING OFF OF SHACKLES OF EXTREME ATTITUDES DEVOID OF ANY SENSE OF REALITY. I WOULD LIKE ARAB STATES TO PROCEED TO PEACE CONFERENCE IN SAME SPIRIT OF SINCERITY, IMBUSED WITH SAME INSPIRATIONS THAT ANIMATE PEOPLE AND GOVERNMENT OF ISRAEL- FOR THEN ROAD TO PEACE WILL BE SMOOTH IN BOTH DIRECTIONS.\n6. SEVENT KNESSET IS CONCLUDING ITS TERM OF OFFICE IN WAKE OF DIFFICULT TRIALS AND SIGNIFICANT VICTORY OF YOM KIPPUR WAR. PEACE CONFERENCE WILL BE OPENING WITH SEVENTH KNESSET NOT YET HAVING COMPLETED ITS TERM. UNCLASSIFIED NO EFFORT MUST BE SPARED TO ENABLE STATE OF ISRAEL-DURING TERM OF EIGHTH KNESSET TO REACH AN AGREEMENT ON SEPARATION OF FORCES AND, WHAT IS MORE, ACHIEVE CNETRAL OBJECTIVES OF OUR POLICY- A LATING PEACE. ONCE STAGE OF SUBSTANTIVE DISCUSSIONS IS REACHED, ISRAELS DELEGATES WILL STRIVE FOR CONTRA- TUAL PEACE BETWEEN PARTIES, WITH DEFENSIBLE BORDERS, AND IN ACCORDANCE WITH GUIDELINES WHICH, IN MY BELIEF, WILL BE EXPRESSED IN BASIC POLICY OF NEXT GOVERNMENT.\n7. ISRAELS PARTICIPATION IN TALKS IS NOT SUBJECT TO ANY PRIOR CONDITIONS. ISRAEL HAS NOT DEMANDED PRIOR ACCEPTANCE OF HER POSITIONS BY OTHER PARTIES, NOR IS SHE ACCEPT- ING BEFOREHAND CONDITIONS OF OTHER PARTIES, AS STATED BY THEM PUBLICLY AND OTHERWISE, BUT EACH SIDE WILL BE FREE TO SUBMIT ITS PROPOSALS ON THE SUBJECTS UNDER DISCUSSION.\n8. WE ARE AWARE OF DIFFICULTIES AND STRUGGLES AHEAD OF US. WE ARE ALERT TO DANGERS. NEVERTHELESS, ISRAELS EMISSARIES WILL GO TO PEACE CONFERENCE SOBERLY, WHOLEHEARTEDLY, AND COURAGEOUSLY. WE SHALL LET NO-ONE TAKE THE NAME OF PEACE IN VAIN. WE SHALL NOT CEASE TO STRIVE FOR A FULL PEACE-IN SIMPLE SENSE OF TERM-A PEACE TO END WARS, WHICH WILL OPEN UP BRIGHT PROSPECTS FOR UNDISTURBED DEVELOPEMTN OF A LIFE OF CREATIVE PROGRESS FOR EACH AND EVERY ONE OF PEOPLES AND STATES IN MIDDLE EAST.

14,0.6428031148360055,236062 Subj: Letter From the President to President Sadat For Ambassador from Secretary1 Please deliver following message from the President to President Sadat:2 Begin text Dear President Sadat: I have been following closely                        developments in the area and your role of leadership during these crucial                        days I know that you have just returned from a very important meeting with                        your Arab colleagues the results of which I believe reflect the hope and                        the desire of the overwhelming majority of the Arab worldindeed people from                        all corners of the earthfor a just and durable peace in the Middle East                        based on Security Council Resolution 2423 We are at an important stage Mr President and I hope all of us have the                        wisdom and the courage despite difficulties to stay on the course charted                        by you and Secretary Kissinger                        recently in Cairo4 We agree that the sixpoint agreement is a package We do not believe that                        certain elements can be implemented and others left to languish                        indefinitely However the disengagement proposals which Egyptian and                        Israeli military representatives have been discussing in recent weeks are                        farreaching This is the reason we have felt and have said honestly to                        you that final agreement was probably not possible before the peace                        conference I can assure you however that in our view the groundwork laid                        in the military representatives talks has not been in vain We will make                        every effort to ensure that the ideas on disengagement discussed in that                        forum will be carried over for consideration at the Geneva conference5 I want to reenforce what Secretary Kissinger has conveyed to your government To retreat now on                        the understanding reached in easing the blockade of the Red Sea and to                        permit your disappointment over the lack of progress in the Kilometer 101                        talks to divert us from opening the peace conference on the 18th of December                        would be a major setback with incalculable consequences Moreover Mr                        President with all due respect asking the United States and the Soviet Union to come into the area to                        guarantee the implementation of the Security Council resolution would be an                        ever more grave step a step which would not serve either the interests of                        your country or of world peace generallyIn                            telegram 3737 from Cairo December 1 Eilts reported that he had delivered to Sadat the Presidents letter and the                            Secretarys November 21 letter to Fahmi see footnote 4 Document                                347 Sadat said that                            he now wondered if he had done the right thing in accepting the                            sixpoint agreement He warned that if there were no first phase                            disengagement Fahmi would have                            to make an opening statement at the peace conference that negotiations                            were not possible until the ceasefire was fully honored and then walk                            out Sadat said he needed US                            help in achieving first phase disengagement in order to strengthen his                            position Otherwise he would have to call on the United States and                            Soviet Union as guarantors of the Security Council resolution to send                            forces Eilts reported he had                            assured Sadat that the United                            States wanted to continue to work with him and warned that an appeal to                            the Security Council for joint USSoviet action would set the peace                            process back National Archives Nixon Presidential Materials NSC Files Box 639 Country Files Middle East Arab                            Republic

     I am committed to a major effort to achieve a durable and just peace in the                        Middle East There will be disappointments on the way You and I know that                        the road will be difficult and arduous because there remains in the area                        deep mistrust and a lack of confidence The Kilometer 101 talks are not the                        main arena It is at the peace conference that the United States will be in                        a position to exercise our constructive influence towards peace based on                        Security

the conference will take place are better than at any other time in                        the history of this problem for achieving a just peace settlement in                        accordance with Resolution 242 It would be a tragedy if this opportunity                        were missed A breakdown of the ceasefire would regrettably again force us                        into a situation of confrontation and that opportunity could be                        irretrievably destroyed8 I have asked Secretary Kissinger                        to undertake another trip to the area and to make Cairo his first stop I                        hope that you will agree to receive him on December 13th or 14th and that                        meanwhile restraint with respect to the ceasefire will be

20,0.8113651155002208,6467 Subj: Husseins Options1 There is no question in my mind that Jordan will be represented at opening                        session of Geneva peace conference but we should keep in mind that King                            Hussein more than any other Arab                        leader is faced with a terrible                        dilemma with regard to future fate of Palestinians and may have to                        reconsider his position during course of conf It is easy for Boumedienne or other Arab leaders whose                        territories are far from Israel to claim that Jordan has no occupied                        territory Such leaders have obviously no direct interest in a settlement                        and some of them would not be unhappy if the Palestinians were to take over                        Jordan For King Hussein however                        the problem is far more complex2 For the East Bankers and for the Hashemite regime none of the solutions                        to the Palestinian problem now envisaged is likely to be satisfactory in the                        long run A union of East Bank West Bank and Gaza would mean a state                        composed of some 25 million Palestinians assuming refugees in Lebanon and                        Syria would be transferred to this new state as against 500000 East                        Bankers While some Palestinians now in Jordan will continue to support the                        Hashemite regime the vast majority of Palestinians are likely to be                        indifferent at best to the fate of King Hussein The King if he can maintain the support and                        loyalty of the Jordan Arab Army which is overwhelmingly composed of East                        Bankers could in the short run keep control of such a state but it is                        difficult to imagine that he could do so over a long period of time3 A confederation of Palestine and Jordan under the Hashemites perhaps more                        loosely constituted than the proposed United Arab Kingdom might make it                        possible for the East Bankers to maintain their identity especially if the                        West Bank and Gaza were demilitarized Since Palestinians most likely would                        continue to constitute a majority on the East Bank Husseins governing problems would remain                        difficult However the complex economic and familial ties linking the two                        banks would give such a confederation some chance for viability The                        essential requirement would be for Hussein to give his Palestinian subjects true autonomy a                        return to the heavyhanded governing methods used prior to June 1967 would                        be inconceivable PostAlgiers realities do not favor this confederation                        solution If Hussein were lucky                        enough to get it through default by the PLO                        and its proponents prospects for Hashemite survival would be enhanced This                        solution likewise would be optimal in terms of US interests4 An independent Palestine would undoubtedly be an unstable nation dominated                        by radical elements and would be a thorn in the side of both Israel and                        Jordan If this solution eventually prevails East Bankers will probably                        insist on the expulsion of some 800000 Palestinians now in Jordan or at                        least of all those who do not identify with the Hashemite regime Where                        would these Palestinians go The West Bank not to mention Gaza could not                        possibly absorb them If they remained in Jordan they would constitute an                        effective 5th column for the eventual takeover of Jordan by the                        Palestinians For the majority of East Bankers therefore the only                        acceptable solution would be an independent Palestine either absorbing most of Palestinian                        refugees or making permanent arrangement with other Arab states to absorb a                        fixed quota of Palestinian refugees5 Keeping in mind that Jordan is the only Arab country which has done and                        continues to do a great deal for Palestinian refugees the above analysis                        illustrates the dilemma in which King Hussein now finds himselfOn                            December 7 in a paper for Kissinger for inclusion in the Presidents Saturday                            Briefing Quandt and Saunders discussed Husseins dilemma in deciding whether                            or not to attend the peace conference noting that he felt betrayed by                            Egypt and Syria because of the position they had taken at Algiers They                            noted he would not decide on whether to send a delegation to Geneva                            until the Secretarys visit and if he did it might be composed entirely                            of Palestinians Prime Minister Rifai had said publicly that Jordan                            should take part in the peace conference only as part of a unified Arab                            delegation in which each party would have agreed on the role of the                            others and that there would be no partial settlements The Prime                            Minister also said that Jordan had no objection to the PLOs participation in the conference                            perhaps as part of the Jordanian delegation

domestic problems Lebanon is                        interested only in getting rid of 250000 Muslem Palestinian refugees                        keeping Christian refugees in Lebanon in order to maintain religious                        balance Syria wants Israel out of Golan Heights and also wants to get rid                        of its Palestinian refugees We assume that these three confrontation states                        would be quite willing to achieve their objective at Jordans expense even                        if it meant the downfall of the Hashemite regime6 On the basis of this analysis we arrive at two main conclusions:A Whichever way we turn we end up with some 1 million Palestinians too many                        who will have to be absorbed While the Arabian Peninsula continues to offer                        some opportunities for emigration the absorption problem centers on lands                        encompassed by pre1967 Jordan This fact coupled with Palestinian and                        external Arab opposition to his rule form the crux of Husseins problemB No matter what happens at the peace conference and after the future of                        King Hussein and of the Hashemite                        regime is uncertain The establishment of a loose confederation as described                        in para 3 above however would probably provide least objectionable                        solution for Hashemite as well as US interestsGraham,frus1969-76v25d374,"1. ISRAELIS DURING PAST 2 WEEKS  WENT THROUGH PERIOD OF DEEPSEATED ALARM WHEN THE THOUGHT FOR A WHILE THEY MIGHT BE CALLED UPON, AS CONDITION FOR OPENING OF GENEVA PEACE CONF, TO AGREE THAT PALESTINIAN REPRESENTATION AT CONF SHOULD BE TOPIC FOR DISCUSSION AT EARLY STAGE. ISRAELIS ALMOST UNANIMOUSLY SAW IN THIS AN EGYPTIAN PLOY TO RAILROAD ISRAEL INTO ACQUIESCING IN PRESENCE OF A SEPARATE FEDAYEEN-RUN PALESTINIAN  DELEGATION, AND BY CLEAR IMPLICATION, IN NOTION OF EITHER INDEPENDENT PALESTINIAN STATE IN WEST BANK-GAZA, OR AT LEAST AUTONOMOUS PALESTINIAN ENTITY THERE WHICH WOULD BE UNDER NOMINAL UN OR JORDANIAN RULE AT BEGINNING BUT IN FACT WOULD BE CONTROLLED BY MILITANT PALESTINIAN NATIONALISTS.\n2. LABOR PARTY ELECTION PLATFORM APPROVED DEC 20 (SEPTEL) CALLS FOR EXPRESION OF ""SELF-IDENTITY"" OF PALESTINIANS INSIDE A ""JORDANIAN-PALESTINIAN STATE ADJOINING ISRAEL. ""PLATFORM LANGUAGE (SAME AS IN TEL AVIV 9619) ALLOWS IN EFFECT FOR POSSIBILITY THAT SUCH STATE MIGHT BE CONSTITUTED TO BE MORE PALESTINIAN THAN JORDANIAN, IN THAT THE STATE IS DESCRIBED ONLY AS AN ""ARAB STATE TO THE EAST OF (ISRAEL."" IT ALSO DOES NOT    SECRET  PRECLUDE POSSIBILITY THAT JORDANIAN AND PALESTINIAN COMMUNITIES WITHIN SUCH STATE MIGHT CHOOSE TO SEGREGATE THSMELVES GEOGRAPHICALLY-- I.E. WITH AUTONOMOUS PALESTINIAN PROVINCE ON WEST BANK. IT DOES, HOWEVER, EXPRESS OUTRIGHT OPPOSITION TO ""THE ESTABLISHEMENT OF AN ADDITIONAL SEPARATE PALESTINIAN ARAB STATE WEST OF THE JORDAN RIVER.""\n3. IN OUR JUDGMENT, THIS IS BY FAR THE MOST FORTHCOMING POSITION TOWARD PALESTINIAN NATIONAL ASPIRATIONS WHICH ANY ISRAELI GOVT COULD AGREE ON AT THIS TIME AND STANDS CLOSER TO THOSE ASPIRATIONS THAN DO THE PERSONAL VIEWPOINTS OF MAJORITY OF ISRAELI LEADERS,AS WE EXPLAIN BELOW. FURTHERMORE, EXCEPT FOR TINY SPLINTER PARTIES OF NO CONSEQENCE WHATEVER, MOST FLEXIBLE POSITION ON PALESTINIAN ISSUE TO BE FOUND IN ISRAELI POLITICAL SPECTRUM TODAY IS THAT OF MAPAM PARTY (PARTNER OF LABOR PARTY IN LABOR ALIGNMENT).  ALTHOUGH MAPAM AGREES WITH LABOR PARTY THAT IT WOULD CERTAINLY BE PREFERABLE FOR NO ADDITIONAL ARAB STATE TO BE ESTABLISHED WEST OF JORDAN RIVER, MAPAM BELIEVES IT IS WRONG FOR ISRAEL TO SEEK TO RULE IT OUT, AS PALESTINIANS SHOULD HAVE FULL RIGHT OF SELF-DETERMINATION. HOWEVER, WE ARE CERTAIN MAPAM WOULD OPPOSE AS FIRMLY AS ANY OTHER GROUP OF ISRAELIS THE IDEA THAT ISRAEL COULD ACQUIESCE IN TAKEOVER OF AN INDEPENDENT PAKESTINIAN ENTITY BY EXTREME MILITANT NATIONALISTS BENT ON DISSOLUTION OF ISRAEL.\n4. IT CAN BE SAID THERE ARE TWO SCHOOLS HERE ON WHAT SHOULD BE DONE TO CONTAIN PALESTINIAN IRREDENTISM: FIGHT IT TOOTH AND NAIL, OR MAKE LIMITED CONCESSIONS TO IT IN HOPE IT CAN THUS BE DEFUSED. THERE MAY BE MAJORITY TENDING IN LATTER DIRECTION AMONG ISRAELI LEADERS, THIS SCHOOL CLEARLY HAS GROWN SINCE  OCTOBER WAR. BUT, NOTWITHSTANDING LABOR PARTY PLATFORM PLANK QUOTED ABOVE, WHETHER ISRAEL WOULD DARE RISK AGREEING TO SOLUTION TO PALESTINIAN PROBLEM OUTLINED IN AMMAN 6467 --- LOOSE CONFEDERATION OF JORDAN AND A RUMP PALESTINE UNDER THE HASHEMITES, WITH WEST BANK AND GAZA STRIP DEMILITARIZED-- IS AT BEST UNCERTAIN.\n5. FLEXIBLE-MINDED ISRAELIS CAN SEE MERIT IN JORDANS PERMITTING SOME DEGREE OF LOCAL AUTONOMY FOR THOSE WEST BANKERS WHO WOULD COME BACK UNDER JORDANIAN RULE AS PART OF PEACE SETTLE- MENT. ISRAELIS KNOW THAT JORDANIAN RULE OVER WEST BANK BEFORE 1967 WAS ARBITRARY AND HARSH AND THAT THIS MAY HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO LOCAL PALESTINIAN NATIONAL ASPIRATIONS. THEY WOULD PREFER FOR JORDANS WEST BANK POPULATION AFTER ISRAEL-JORDAN PEACE SETTLEMENT NOT TO BE DISGRUNTLED FOR THIS REASON. A SECOND REASON WOULD BE ISRAELI DESIRE FOR PRO-PALESTINIAN PRESSURES ON HUSSEIN FROM REST OF ARAB WORLD TO EASE, AND THEY REALIZE THAT WEST BANK AUTONOMY ON PURELY LOCAL MATTERS WOULD BE SOMETHING HUSSEIN COULD POINT OT. HOWEVER, SKEPTICS ON PALESTINIAN PROBLEM ARE DISTURBED BY THOUGHT OF INSTITUTIONALIZING WEST BANK SEPARATENESS WITH A PROVINCIAL LEGISLATURE AND PROVINCIAL CAPITAL, AND ESPECIALLY NOTION OF CALLING SUCH PROVINCE ""PALESTINE"" AND IMPLYING RECOGNITION OF BASIC DIFFERENCES OF CHARACTER (IF NOT NATIONALITY) BETWEEN WEST BANKERS AND EAST BANKERS. THEIR APPREHENSIONS ARISE FROM BELIEF SHARED BY VIRTUALLY ALL ISRAELIS:  THAT ALL PALESTINIANS WHEREVER THEY CURRENTLY RESIDE, AND REGARDLESS WHETHER THEY HAVE BEEN INTE- GRATED INTO ECONOMIES OF JORDAN,KUWAIT, SAUDI ARABIA,    SECRET  ETC,  OR ARE STILL LIVING IN GAZAN OR LEBANESE REFUGEE CAMPS, ARE IRREDENTISTS FAVORING EVENTUAL TRANSFORMATION OF ISRAEL INTO BINATIONAL STATE HAVING PALESTINIAN MAJORITY. IRREDENTISM OF PALESTINIANS IN ISRAELI EYES IS ONLY MATTER OF RELATIVITY.\n6. IF FULLY AUTONOMOUS PALESTINIAN ENTITY IN WEST BANK AND GAZA WERE ESTABLISHED DESPITE ISRAELS RESERVATIONS, ISRAELIS WOULD CERTAINLY WANT CREDIBLE JORDANIAN DETERENT TO OUT- SIDE MEDDLERS DESIRING TO HELP INHABITANTS OF SUCH ENTITY ACHIEVE SOLUTION AGAINST ISRAEL BY FORCE. AND THEY WOULD MUCH PREFER TO SEE FIRM HASHEMITE HAND BEHIND SCENE TO CHOKE OFF MORE EXTREME MANIFESTATIONS OF PALESTINIAN NATIONALISM INCLUDE PALESTINIAN ENTITY. MANY ISRAELIS REALIZE THAT CLANDESTINE JORDANIAN CONTROLS OF THIS KIND COULD PROVIDE IRRITANT THAT WOULD DRIVE WEST BANK POPULATION TOWARD EXTREMISM. THEY THUS COULD UNDERMINE WHAT LITTLE CHANCE THERE WOULD BE FOR LOCAL NATIONAL ASPIRATIONS GRADUALLY TO BE DISSIPATED BY FACT OF ENTITYS EXISTENCE AND FOR A MODERATE PALESTINIAN LEADER- SHIP TO DEVELOP OVER TIME.  DESPITE THIS RISK OF COUNTER- PRODUCTIVITY, ISRAELIS WOULD WANT CONTROLS TO BE THERE, AT LEAST DURING A FIRST PHASE LASTING SEVERAL YEARS.\n7. AS WE HAVE PREVIOUSLY REPORTED, IT IS NOT JUST MILITANT PALESTINIAN NATIONALISM WHICH WORRIES ISRAELIS. IT IS ALSO MARXISM AND OTHER EXTREME LEFTIST IDEOLOGY WHICH CHARACTERIZES MOST OF FEDAYEEN MOVEMENT. ISRAELIS CAN SEE THIS RADICALISM SWEEPING LIKE WILDFIRE THROUGH POPULATIONS OF WEST BANK AND GAZA STRIP IF FEDAYEEN WERE EVER TO RETURN TO AREA.  RESULT WOULD BE THAT PALESTINIAN ENTITY, WHETHER ONLY AUTONOMOUS  PROVINCE OF JORDAN OR ACTUAL INDEPENDENT STATE, WOULD BECOME IMMEDIATE OBJECT OF ADMIRATION OF SYRIA, IRAQ, ALGERIA, AND  SOUTH YEMEN. EVEN IF FRESH MID EAST  WARS DID NOT ERUPT, HIGHLY UNSTABLE SITUATION WOULD BE CREATED BY FIRING MILITANT PALESTINIAN NATIONALISM WITH IDEOLOGICAL LEFTIST RADICALISM AND GIVING TO BOTH A TERRITORIAL AND POPULATION BASE CONTIGUOUS WITH ISRAEL.\n8.  ANOTHER LIKELY RESULT WHICH CONCERNS ISRAELIS WOULD BE DANGER THAT PALESTINIANS FROM LEBANON-, SYRIA, EAST JORDAN (I.E. LARGELY CAMP DWELLERS), AND EVEN KUWAIT, SAUDI ARABIA,    SECRET  AND ELSEWHERE (I.E. LOCALLY INTERGRATED PEOPLE) MIGHT MIGRATE EN MASSE TO A PALESTINIAN ENTITY NOT UNDER FULL AND OBVIOUS  HASHEMITE CONTROL. ISRAELIS FEAR THAT SUCH OVERCROWDING, IN ADDITION TO CONTRIBUTING TO INTERNAL INSTABILITY OF PALESTINIAN ENTITY, WOULD ADD CONSIDERABLE MORAL WEIGHT IN EYES OF WORLD TO IRREDENTIST CLAIMS OF ENTITY AGAINST ISRAEL. DEEPEST ISRAELI FEAR OF ALL IS THAT ENTIRE NON-JEWISH WORLD MIGHT SOMEDAY COME  TO CONCLUSION THAT ONLY SOLUTION TO MID EAST PROBLEM IS INDEED TO ESTABLISH COMBINED JEWISH-PALESTINIAN STATE IN PLACE OF ISRAEL OR, AT MINIMUM, TO REVERT TO 1947 UN PARTITION PLAN FOR PALESTINE.\n9. THUS, WE DOUBT GOI WOULD CONTEMPLATE WITHDRAWING ISRAELI FORCES FROM WEST BANK AND GAZA STRIP BEFORE SEEING TO IT THAT ARRANGEMENTS WERE IN PLACE FOR SCREENING ALL PROSPECTIVE ARRIVALS IN THESE AREAS FROM ABROAD AND FOR KEEPING EXTREME LEFTISTS, TERRORISTS, AND MASSIVE NUMBERS OF WOULD- BE RETURNEES OUT. ONE CAN ONLY SPECULATE ABOUT RANGE OF POSSIBLE ARRANGEMENTS FOR KEEPING FEDAYEEN OUT WHICH ISRAEL COULD ACCEPT, BUT WE DOUBT ISRAELIS WOULD GO ALONG WITH SET-UP WHICH DID NOT GIVE THEM DIRECT PARTICIPATION\n0. QUESTION ARISES, WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF ARRANGEMENT WERE WORKED OUT WHEREBY ISRAEL RETURNED MOST OF WEST BANK TO JORDAN. JORDAN ESTABLISHED PALESTINIAN AUTONOMOUS PROVINCE THERE WITH SAFEGUARDS SATISFACTORY TO ISRAEL,  AND NEVERTHELESS MILITANT PALESTINIAN NATIONALISTS SOMEHOW SUCCEEDED IN SUP- PLANTING HASHEMITE- CONTROLLED PROVINCIAL AUTHORITY AND TOOK OVER CONTROL OF AREA. WE BELIEVE THAT ISRAEL WOULD INTERVENE MILITARILY. IN OTHER WORDS, ONLY IF OVER A PERIOD OF MANY YEARS A MODERATE PALESTINIAN LEADERSHIPEVOLVED ON WEST BANK WHICH WAS    SECRET  OPENLY DEDICATED TO PROPOSITION THAT INDEPENDENT JEWISH STATE HA RIGHT TO EXIST WITHIN ITS EXISTING BORDERS, AND ONLY IF THIS LEADERSHIP HAD SUPPORT OF VAST MAJORITY OF PALESTINIANS EVERY- WHERE AND FEDAYEEN ORGANIZATIONS IN BEIRUT SUFFERED FINAL  POLITICAL ECLIPSE, COULD ANY MEANINGFUL CHANGE OCCUR IN ISRAELS ABIDING AND UNIVERSAL SUSPICION OF PALESTINIAN NATIONAL AMBITIONS.

           indifferent at best to the fate of King Hussein The King if he can maintain the support and                        loyalty of the Jordan Arab Army which is overwhelmingly composed of East                        Bankers could in the short run keep control of such a state but it is                        difficult to imagine that he could do so over a long period of time3 A confederation of Palestine and Jordan under the Hashemites perhaps more                        loosely constituted than the proposed United Arab Kingdom might make it                        possible for the East Bankers to maintain their identity especially if the                        West Bank and Gaza were demilitarized Since Palestinians most likely would                        continue to constitute a majority on the East Bank Husseins governing problems would remain                        difficult However the complex economic and familial ties linking the two                        banks would give such a confederation some chance for viability The                        essential requirement would be for Hussein to give his Palestinian subjects true autonomy a                        return to the heavyhanded governing methods used prior to June 1967 would                        be inconceivable PostAlgiers realities do not favor this confederation                        solution If Hussein were lucky                        enough to get it through default by the PLO                        and its proponents prospects for Hashemite survival would be enhanced This                        solution likewise would be optimal in terms of US interests4 An independent Palestine would undoubtedly be an unstable nation dominated                        by radical elements and would be a thorn in the side of both Israel and                        Jordan If this solution eventually prevails East Bankers will probably                        insist on the expulsion of some 800000 Palestinians now in Jordan or at                        least of all those who do not identify with the Hashemite regime Where                        would these Palestinians go The West Bank not to mention Gaza could not                        possibly absorb them If they remained in Jordan they would constitute an                        effective 5th column for the eventual takeover of Jordan by the                        Palestinians For the majority of East Bankers therefore the only                        acceptable solution would be an independent Palestine either absorbing most of Palestinian                        refugees or making permanent arrangement with other Arab states to absorb a                        fixed quota of Palestinian refugees5 Keeping in mind that Jordan is the only Arab country which has done and                        continues to do a great deal for Palestinian refugees the above analysis                        illustrates the dilemma in which King Hussein now finds himselfOn                            December 7 in a paper for Kissinger for inclusion in the Presidents Saturday                            Briefing Quandt and Saunders discussed Husseins dilemma in deciding whether                            or not to attend the peace conference noting that he felt betrayed by                            Egypt and Syria because of the position they had taken at Algiers They                            noted he would not decide on whether to send a delegation to Geneva                            until the Secretarys visit and if he did it might be composed entirely                            of Palestinians Prime Minister Rifai had said publicly that Jordan                            should take part in the peace conference only as part of a unified Arab                            delegation in which each party would have agreed on the role of the                            others and that there would be no partial settlements The Prime                            Minister also said that Jordan had no objection to the PLOs participation in the conference                            perhaps as part of the Jordanian delegation

confrontation states                        would be quite willing to achieve their objective at Jordans expense even                        if it meant the downfall of the Hashemite regime6 On the basis of this analysis we arrive at two main conclusions:A Whichever way we turn we end up with some 1 million Palestinians too many                        who will have to be absorbed While the Arabian Peninsula continues to offer                        some opportunities for emigration the absorption problem centers on lands                        encompassed by pre1967 Jordan This fact coupled with Palestinian and                        external Arab opposition to his rule form the crux of Husseins problemB No matter what happens at the peace conference and after the future of                        King Hussein and of the Hashemite                        regime is uncertain The establishment of a loose confederation as described                        in para 3 above however

keep in mind that King                            Hussein more than any other Arab                        leader is faced with a terrible                        dilemma with regard to future fate of Palestinians and may have to                        reconsider his position during course of conf It is easy for Boumedienne or other Arab leaders whose                        territories are far from Israel to claim that Jordan has no occupied                        territory Such leaders have obviously no direct interest in a settlement                        and some of them would not be unhappy if the Palestinians were to take over                        Jordan For King Hussein however                        the problem is far more complex2 For the East Bankers and for the Hashemite regime

JORDANIAN AMBASSADOR ABDUL MUNIM RIFAI CAME TO SEE ME THIS MORNING.  HE FIRST RECOUNTED ROCKY ROAD OF RECENT EGYPTIAN/JORDANIAN RELATIONS, INCLUDING SADATS DISPLEASURE WITH HUSSEIN DURING LAST DAYS OF OCTOBER HOSTILITIES FOR FAILING TO MEET FORMERS ""DEMANDS"" (UNSPECIFIED).  HE THEN ADDRESSED CURRENT STATE OF PLAY BETWEEN THE TWO COUNTRIES WITH PARTICULAR REFERENCE TO UPCOMING PEACE CONFERENCE AND TO PLO PARTICIPATION.\n2.  EGYPTS PERFORMANCE DURING ARAB SUMMIT IN PRESSING FOR SEPARATE PLO ROLE HAD BEEN DISAPPOINTING TO JORDAN. RIFAI HAD BEEN IN AMMAN SINCE THAT TIME AND FOUND HUSSEIN ADAMANT ON REFUSING TO PARTICIPATE IN CONFERENCE IF ARAB STATES INSIST ON SEPARATE PLO REPRESENTATION.  ACCORDINGLY, HE HAD BEEN SENT BACK TO CAIRO TO MAKE CLEAR JORDANIAN POSITION.  SHORTLY AFTER ARRIVING THREE DAYS AGO, HE SAW FAHMY AND STRESSED JORDAN WOULD NOT FEEL ITSELF ABLE TO ATTEND UNLESS EGYPT AND OTHER ARAB STATES CLEARLY DEFINE ITS RIGHTS AND RESPONSIBILITIES ON WEST BANK.  JORDAN HAS RESPONSIBILITY, HE STRESSED, FOR RECOVERY WEST BANK    SECRET  TERRITORIES AND PALESTINIAN REFUGEES NOT ONLY IN JORDAN BUT ELSEWHERE AS WELL.  JORDAN WAS UNCLEAR WHETHER EGYPT WISHED IT TO ATTEND GENEVA TALKS.  WHEN FAHMY COUNTERED THAT JORDAN INCLUDED AMONG ARAB STATES LISTED IN DRAFT LETTER TO SYG AND THAT THIS SHOULD CONSTITUTE EGYPTIAN ENDORSEMENT OF JORDANIAN ATTENDANCE, RIFAI RESPONDED THIS WOULD REPRESENT INVITATION FROM THE TWO POWERS BUT WAS INADEQUATE TO DEMONSTRATE EGYPTIAN CONCURRENCE.  HE ASKED FOR A PUBLIC EGYPTIAN STATEMENT SAYING IT EXPECTED JORDAN TO ATTEND AND REPRESENT WEST BANK AND PALESTINIANS WHILE THERE.  FAHMY ALLEGEDLY CALLED IN AHRAM CORRESPONDENT IN HIS OUTER OFFICE AND DICTATED SHORT STATEMENT TO THE EFFECT WHICH, WHILE SOMEWHAT ANODYNED, RIFAI WAS PREPARED TO ACCEPT.  ALTHOUGH FAHMY INSTRUCTED AHRAM REPORT THIS PUBLIC STATEMENT FOLLOWING DAY, IT HAS NOT YET APPEARED.  HE HAS HAD NO EXPLANATION FROM FAHMY, HENCE EGYPTS POSITION REMAINS UNCLEAR.\n3.  RIFAI IS SCHEDULED TO SEE SADAT TODAY.  AT THAT MEETING HE INTENDS TO REITERATE JORDANIAN POSITION AS HE HAS GIVEN IT TO FAHMY AND OFFER SEVERAL ALTERNATIVES FOR EGYPT TO SHOW ITS DESIRE HAVE JORDAN THERE ON A BASIS ACCEPTABLE TO HUSSEIN:  (A) A PUBLIC GOE STATEMENT SIMILAR TO THAT WHICH FAHMY DICTATED BUT WHICH NEVER APPEARED, (B) A MEETING BETWEEN HUSSEIN AND SADAT IN CAIRO PRIOR TO GENEVA TALKS IN ORDER TO DEMONSTRATE EGYPTIAN SUPPORT OF JORDANIAN POSITION, (C) FAILING THIS, A MEETING BETWEEN REPRESENTATIVES OF THE TWO GOVERNMENTS AT A MINISTERIAL LEVEL TO WORK OUT SOMETHING SATISFACTORY.  IF EGYPTIANS REFUSE ANY OF THESE ALTER- NATIVES, RIFAI WAS PESSIMISTIC THAT HUSSEIN WILL BE WILLING TO ATTEND.  THIS, HE CONTENDED, WOULD BE BAD FOR PEACE CONFERENCE.\n4.  RIFAI ALSO CLAIMED TO HAVE BEEN IN TOUCH WITH PLO REPRESENTATIVES IN CAIRO TWO EVENINGS AGO.  HE HAD POINTED OUT TO THEM HUSSEINS POSITION THAT JORDAN SHOULD IN FIRST INSTANCE REPRESENT ALL PALESTINIANS.  AT A LATER STAGE PALESTINIAN REPRESENTATIVES MIGHT JOIN TALKS.  HOW THIS MIGHT BE DONE SHOULD BE DISCUSSED AT CONFERENCE.  HE CLAIMED PLO REPRESENTATIVES NOT ADVERSE TO HIS IDEAS, SINCE DEEP DIVISIONS EXIST AMONG THEM AS TO WHETHER AND HOW THEY SHOULD PARTICIPATE IN GENEVA TALKS.    SECRET  5.  RIFAI ASKED IF FORMAL INVITATIONS HAVE YET BEEN SENT. I TOLD HIM THAT I WAS SURE US REPRESENTATIVE IN AMMAN DISCUSSING MATTER WITH JORDANIANS BUT IT WAS MY UNDERSTANDING MODALITIES STILL BEING WORKED OUT.  HE COMMENTED THAT IT WAS NOT MERELY A MATTER OF MODALITIES, BUT ALSO FORM WHICH ANY INVITATION TO JORDAN TAKES THAT WILL MATTER WITH HUSSEIN.  HE PERSONALLY BELIEVES JORDAN SHOULD PARTICIPATE, BUT HE HAD TO ACKNOWLEDGE KINGS VIEWS WERE VALID AND HAD FORCEFULLY SOUGHT TO PRESENT THEM HERE.  HE NOTED HUSSEINS STRONG SENSE OF PRIDE, AND OBSERVED MUCH WILL ALSO DEPEND ON RESULTS SECRETARYS VISIT TO AMMAN.\n6.  RIFAI IS SCHEDULED RETURN TO AMMAN TOMORROW.  IF JORDAN PARTICIPATES IN GENEVA TALKS, HE THOUGHT HE MIGHT WELL BE THE JORDANIAN REPRESENTATIVE.\n7.  IN SEPARATE CONVERSATION WITH USINTOFF, JORDANIAN POLITICAL COUNSELOR ALSO MADE POINT THAT KING BELIEVES IT LIKELY THAT A WAY COULD BE FOUND AT GENEVA TO HAVE PALES- TINIANS JOIN TALKS AFTER OPENING SESSIONS.  HE STRESSED THAT HUSSEIN IS DETERMINED THAT JORDAN SHOULD BE REPRESENTED AND IS UNDERTAKING A BROAD DIPLOMATIC CAMPAIGN TO INSURE THAT IT IS.

Palestinians now in Jordan or at                        least of all those who do not identify with the Hashemite regime Where                        would these Palestinians go The West Bank not to mention Gaza could not                        possibly absorb them If they remained in Jordan they would constitute an                        effective 5th column for the eventual takeover of Jordan by the                        Palestinians For the majority of East Bankers therefore the only                        acceptable solution would be an independent Palestine either absorbing most of Palestinian                        refugees or making permanent arrangement with other Arab states to absorb a                        fixed quota of Palestinian refugees5 Keeping in mind that Jordan is the only Arab country which has done and                        continues to do a great deal for Palestinian refugees the above analysis                        illustrates the dilemma in which King Hussein now finds himselfOn                            December 7 in a paper for Kissinger for inclusion in the Presidents Saturday                            Briefing Quandt and Saunders discussed Husseins dilemma in deciding whether                            or not to attend the peace conference noting that he felt betrayed by                            Egypt and Syria because of the position they had taken at Algiers They                            noted he would not decide on whether to send a delegation to Geneva                            until the Secretarys visit and if he did it might be composed entirely                            of Palestinians Prime Minister Rifai had said publicly that Jordan                            should take part in the peace conference only as part of a unified Arab                            delegation in which each party would have agreed on the role of the                            others and that there would be no partial settlements The Prime                            Minister also said that Jordan had no objection to the PLOs participation in the conference                            perhaps as part of the Jordanian delegation

domestic problems Lebanon is                        interested only in getting rid of 250000 Muslem Palestinian refugees                        keeping Christian refugees in Lebanon in order to

confrontation states                        would be quite willing to achieve their objective at Jordans expense even                        if it meant the downfall of the Hashemite regime6 On the basis of this analysis we arrive at two main conclusions:A Whichever way we turn we end up with some 1 million Palestinians too many                        who will have to be absorbed While the Arabian Peninsula continues to offer                        some opportunities for emigration the absorption problem centers on lands                        encompassed by pre1967 Jordan This fact coupled with Palestinian and                        external Arab opposition to his rule form the crux of Husseins problemB No matter what happens at the peace conference and after the future of                        King Hussein and of the Hashemite                        regime is uncertain The establishment of a loose confederation as described                        in para 3 above however

24,0.7053849291634015,6467 Subj: Husseins Options1 There is no question in my mind that Jordan will be represented at opening                        session of Geneva peace conference but we should keep in mind that King                            Hussein more than any other Arab                        leader is faced with a terrible                        dilemma with regard to future fate of Palestinians and may have to                        reconsider his position during course of conf It is easy for Boumedienne or other Arab leaders whose                        territories are far from Israel to claim that Jordan has no occupied                        territory Such leaders have obviously no direct interest in a settlement                        and some of them would not be unhappy if the Palestinians were to take over                        Jordan For King Hussein however                        the problem is far more complex2 For the East Bankers and for the Hashemite regime none of the solutions                        to the Palestinian problem now envisaged is likely to be satisfactory in the                        long run A union of East Bank West Bank and Gaza would mean a state                        composed of some 25 million Palestinians assuming refugees in Lebanon and                        Syria would be transferred to this new state as against 500000 East                        Bankers While some Palestinians now in Jordan will continue to support the                        Hashemite regime the vast majority of Palestinians are likely to be                        indifferent at best to the fate of King Hussein The King if he can maintain the support and                        loyalty of the Jordan Arab Army which is overwhelmingly composed of East                        Bankers could in the short run keep control of such a state but it is                        difficult to imagine that he could do so over a long period of time3 A confederation of Palestine and Jordan under the Hashemites perhaps more                        loosely constituted than the proposed United Arab Kingdom might make it                        possible for the East Bankers to maintain their identity especially if the                        West Bank and Gaza were demilitarized Since Palestinians most likely would                        continue to constitute a majority on the East Bank Husseins governing problems would remain                        difficult However the complex economic and familial ties linking the two                        banks would give such a confederation some chance for viability The                        essential requirement would be for Hussein to give his Palestinian subjects true autonomy a                        return to the heavyhanded governing methods used prior to June 1967 would                        be inconceivable PostAlgiers realities do not favor this confederation                        solution If Hussein were lucky                        enough to get it through default by the PLO                        and its proponents prospects for Hashemite survival would be enhanced This                        solution likewise would be optimal in terms of US interests4 An independent Palestine would undoubtedly be an unstable nation dominated                        by radical elements and would be a thorn in the side of both Israel and                        Jordan If this solution eventually prevails East Bankers will probably                        insist on the expulsion of some 800000

Dec 7A memorandum of                            conversation recording this meeting is ibid NSC Files Box 1027 PresidentialHAK Memcons HAK                             Presidential December 1973 2 of 2 2 After welcoming Ghorbal warmly Secretary opened conversation by saying he                        had kept his promise to President Sadat and had made good progress in trying to shape public                        and Congressional opinion toward support for a peace settlement Once peace                        conference opened in Geneva we expected to see substantial progress                        Secretary referred to process of ironing out of details of modalities such                        as letter to SYG saying he hoped these                        would not impede convening of the conference Brief discussion ensued on                        efforts to resolve textual differences in letter to SYG Ghorbal had apparently not been informed of latest                        exchanges3 Ghorbal said he had message to convey from President Sadat prior to Secretarys departure from                        Washington Following Presidents meeting with Ambassador EiltsSee                                footnote 2 Document 369                        Ghorbal had found Sadat quite                        disturbed because of Israeli intransigence and the feeling that US was                        not putting sufficient weight behind getting Israelis to implement para B of                        sixpoint agreement Ambassador Eilts had raised factor of Israeli elections and Sadat had answered that he too had serious                        political problems even mentioning fact that Soviets have protested                        recently enhanced USEgyptian relations4 In consequence said Ghorbal Sadat feels that real building up of confidence which had                        taken place between Secretary and him is now being jeopardized by Israeli                        tactics Indeed this poisoning of incipient improvement in USArab                        relations had always been Israels objective Ghorbal said Sadat feels disengagement was Secretarys                        idea he bought it but now he fails to see any followthrough and he is                        beginning to wonder what he got into In brief said Ghorbal he felt he                        owed it to Secretary to say that real problem was shaping up in terms of                            erosion of credibility which                        Secretary had so successfully established during his trip in November5 Ghorbal referred to significant concessions Sadat had already made under sixpoint agreement: POW exchange which Ghorbal said had been most                        difficult decision and Bab alMandeb Sadat had not been afraid to make these concessions any more                        than he had been afraid to go to war when that was necessary Ghorbal said                        that what was now needed was an initial phase of disengagement prior to                        convening of peace conference because such a step would materially improve                        atmosphere for conference itself6 Secretary said he appreciated Ambassadors candor and hoped that                        Ambassador also appreciated fact that during many years they had known each                        other Secretary had always been candid about what was possible and what was                        not possible When he was in Cairo he had explained to President Sadat that he needed time to prepare                        public opinion for the steps that would be necessary to reach a peace                        settlement Secretary said in intervening month he had worked hard on this                        and felt he had made substantial progress He thought there was growing                        segment of opinionincluding within American Jewish communityfor kind of                        substantial disengagement plan that Secretary had talked about with                        Egyptians He had also worked hard to get Israelis to accept this concept                        There was already some sign that these efforts were bearing fruit in General                        Yarivs proposals even though Israelis had had to pull back because of                        domestic political problems7 Secretary said that what might look like slow procedure to President                            Sadat was necessary in terms of                        our own political process and would actually lead to faster results If                        moves were made prematurely which led to explosion of public opinion against                        them everything would be wrecked All he could say to President Sadat was that within measurable period of                        time after peace conference convenedSecretary said he would be prepared to                        discuss time frame more precisely when he got to Cairowe would achieve kind                        of disengagement plan that would make whole question of October 22 lines                        irrelevant Secretary had told Sadat                        this in NovemberSee Document 324 he was saying it again now and                        Ambassador would see that this was in

2 After welcoming Ghorbal warmly Secretary opened conversation by saying he                        had kept his promise to President Sadat and had made good progress in trying to shape public                        and Congressional opinion toward support for a peace settlement Once peace                        conference opened in Geneva we expected to see substantial progress                        Secretary referred to process of ironing out of details of modalities such                        as letter to SYG saying he hoped these                        would not impede convening of the conference Brief discussion ensued on                        efforts to resolve textual differences in letter to SYG Ghorbal had apparently not been informed of latest                        exchanges3 Ghorbal said he had message to convey from President Sadat prior to Secretarys departure from                        Washington Following Presidents meeting with Ambassador EiltsSee                                footnote 2 Document 369                        Ghorbal had found Sadat quite                        disturbed because of Israeli intransigence and the feeling that US was                        not putting sufficient weight behind getting Israelis to implement para B of                        sixpoint agreement Ambassador Eilts had raised factor of Israeli elections and Sadat had answered that he too had serious                        political problems even mentioning fact that Soviets have protested                        recently enhanced USEgyptian relations4 In consequence said Ghorbal Sadat feels that real building up of confidence which had                        taken place between Secretary and him is now being jeopardized by Israeli                        tactics Indeed this poisoning of incipient improvement in USArab                        relations had always been Israels objective Ghorbal said Sadat feels disengagement was Secretarys                        idea he bought it but now he fails to see any followthrough and he is                        beginning to wonder what he got into In brief said Ghorbal he felt he                        owed it to Secretary to say that real problem was shaping up in terms of                            erosion of credibility which                        Secretary had so successfully established during his trip in November5 Ghorbal referred to significant concessions Sadat had already made under sixpoint agreement: POW exchange which Ghorbal said had been most                        difficult decision and Bab alMandeb Sadat had not been afraid to make these concessions any more                        than he had been afraid to go to war when that was necessary Ghorbal said                        that what was now needed was an initial phase of disengagement prior to                        convening of peace conference because such a step would materially improve                        atmosphere for conference itself6 Secretary said he appreciated Ambassadors candor and hoped that                        Ambassador also appreciated fact that during many years they had known each                        other Secretary had always been candid about what was possible and what was                        not possible When he was in Cairo he had explained to President Sadat that he needed time to prepare                        public opinion for the steps that would be necessary to reach a peace                        settlement Secretary said in intervening month he had worked hard on this                        and felt he had made substantial progress He thought there was growing                        segment of opinionincluding within American Jewish communityfor kind of                        substantial disengagement plan that Secretary had talked about with                        Egyptians He had also worked hard to get Israelis to accept this concept                        There was already some sign that these efforts were bearing fruit in General                        Yarivs proposals even though Israelis had had to pull back because of                        domestic political problems7 Secretary said that what might look like slow procedure to President                            Sadat was necessary in terms of                        our own political process and would actually lead to faster results If                        moves were made prematurely which led to explosion of public opinion against                        them everything would be wrecked All he could say to President Sadat was that within measurable period of                        time after peace conference convenedSecretary said he would be prepared to                        discuss time frame more precisely when he got to Cairowe would achieve kind                        of disengagement plan that would make whole question of October 22 lines

conference Brief discussion ensued on                        efforts to resolve textual differences in letter to SYG Ghorbal had apparently not been informed of latest                        exchanges3 Ghorbal said he had message to convey from President Sadat prior to Secretarys departure from                        Washington Following Presidents meeting with Ambassador EiltsSee                                footnote 2 Document 369                        Ghorbal had found Sadat quite                        disturbed because of Israeli intransigence and the feeling that US was                        not putting sufficient weight behind getting Israelis to implement para B of                        sixpoint agreement Ambassador Eilts had raised factor of Israeli elections and Sadat had answered that he too had serious                        political problems even mentioning fact that Soviets have protested                        recently enhanced USEgyptian relations4 In consequence said Ghorbal Sadat feels that real building up of confidence which had                        taken place between Secretary and him is now being jeopardized by Israeli                        tactics Indeed this poisoning of incipient improvement in USArab                        relations had always been Israels objective Ghorbal said Sadat feels disengagement was Secretarys                        idea he bought it but now he fails to see any followthrough and he is                        beginning to wonder what he got into In brief said Ghorbal he felt he                        owed it to Secretary to say that real problem was shaping up in terms of                            erosion of credibility which                        Secretary had so successfully established during his trip in November5 Ghorbal referred to significant concessions Sadat had already made under sixpoint agreement: POW exchange which Ghorbal said had been most                        difficult decision and Bab alMandeb Sadat had not been afraid to make these concessions any more                        than he had been afraid to go to war when that was necessary Ghorbal said                        that what was now needed was an initial phase of disengagement prior to                        convening of peace conference because such a step would materially improve                        atmosphere for conference itself6 Secretary said he appreciated Ambassadors candor and hoped that                        Ambassador also appreciated fact that during many years they had known each                        other Secretary had always been candid about what was possible and what was                        not possible When he was in Cairo he had explained to President Sadat that he needed time to prepare                        public opinion for the steps that would be necessary to reach a peace                        settlement Secretary said in intervening month he had worked hard on this                        and felt he had made substantial progress He thought there was growing                        segment of opinionincluding within American Jewish communityfor kind of                        substantial disengagement plan that Secretary had talked about with                        Egyptians He had also worked hard to get Israelis to accept this concept                        There was already some sign that these efforts were bearing fruit in General                        Yarivs proposals even though Israelis had had to pull back because of                        domestic political problems7 Secretary said that what might look like slow procedure to President                            Sadat was necessary in terms of                        our own political process and would actually lead to faster results If                        moves were made prematurely which led to explosion of public opinion against                        them everything would be wrecked All he could say to President Sadat was that within measurable period of                        time after peace conference convenedSecretary said he would be prepared to                        discuss time frame more precisely when he got to Cairowe would achieve kind                        of disengagement plan that would make whole question of October 22 lines

fact what happened8 Ghorbal said he would faithfully report these assurances and then                        reverted to idea that some initial measure of withdrawal might be                        accomplished prior to peace conference Perhaps something symbolic was                        possible Secretary said he was giving most careful thought to this                        possibility and might have something to raise with President Sadat when he got to Cairo He did not wish to leave                        Ambassador with impression that he was promising anything however9 Ghorbal asked about military assistance to Israel Secretary responded                        that regular supplies were continuing Ghorbal noted that whereas resupply                        airlift had stopped deliveries were continuing by sea Secretary                        acknowledged this but said that our information was that what we were                        sending to Israel was less than what was going to Arabs Secretary said                        this however was no longer the issue As result of October fighting                        Israelis now knew how dependent they were on US This fact had changed                        perceptions in Israel10 In response to Ghorbal question about Dayan call on SecretarySee                                Document 376 Secretary said two                        main issues had been discussed First was that Dayan felt US was not being liberal enough in its arms                        supply to Israel secondly two had spent a lot of time discussing what                        Secretary feels needs to be done in terms of solid progress toward a peace                        settlement11 In summary Secretary asked Ambassador Ghorbal to tell President                            Sadat that we continued to                        attach greatest importance to our relations with Egypt that we felt that                            Sadat had taken a courageous                        step in agreeing to six points and implementing them that we understood his                        concern that insufficient progress had been made to date toward goals we had                        mutually discussed and that Secretary was asking for matter of weeks to                        show that these results could and would be

REGARDING SUBSTANCE, AHRAM CAREFULLY NOTES SADATS STATEMENT THAT AMONG MATTERS AGREED ON BETWEEN HIMSELF AND SECRETARY WAS THAT SEPARATION OF FORCES SHOULD BE INCLUDED IN FIRST STAGE OF PEACE CONFERENCE ACTIVITIES. AND THAT CHIEF GOAL OF CONFERENCE WAS IMPLEMENTATION OF CONFIDENTIAL SC RES CALLING FOR TOTAL WITHDRAWAL OF ISRAELI FORCES FROM OCCUPIED LANDS AND ACHIEVEMENT OF THE RIGHTS OF PALESTINIAN PEOPLE. ALMOST EQUAL PROMINENCE IS GIVEN TO SADATS REMARK THAT WHILE ALL PARTIES WOULD MEET AT CONFERENCE IN SAME ROOM THERE WOULD NOT BE DIRECT CONSULTATIONS BETWEEN EGYPTIANS AND ISRAELIS.

VEIPEACE TALKS: KING SAID GOJ HAD BEEN INFORMED OF CERTAIN ""PROCEDURAL DETAILS"" FOR GENEVA CONFERENCE, BUT THAT IT HAD NOT YET BEEN FORMALLY INVITED TO ATTEND.  IN ANY EVENT, HE SAID, JORDANIAN PARTICIPATION WOULD DEPEND ON WHETHER OTHER ARAB GOVTS., NOTABLY SYRIA AND EGYPT, COULD SATISFACTORILY ""CLARIFY"" ALGIERS SUMMITS ""EQUIVOCAL DECISION"" TO RECOGNIZE PLO AS SOLE PALESTINIAN REP.  ""BEFORE GOING TO GENEVA, WE MUST COORDINATE OUR POLICY AND ALL OUR INITIATIVES WITH EGYPT AND SYRIA.  WE MUST KNOW WHY WE ACCEPT NEGOTIATIONS, OR WHY WE REFUSE THEM, AND WE MUST UNDERSTAND BOTH THE REASONS FOR OUR CHOICE AND THE CONSEQUENCES THAT WILL FLOW FROM THAT CHOICE.""\n3. PLO-GOJ RELATIONS: KING MOCKED PLO CLAIM TO SPEAK FOR ALL PALESTICIANS, NOTED GOJ HAD ALWAYS REFRAINED FROM MAKING SUCH SWEEPING CLAIM, FOR ITSELF, AND INSISTED QUESTION OF SOLE REPRESENTIVITY COULD ONLY BE DECIDED BY REFERENDUM FOLLOWING ISRAELI WITHDRAWAL FROM OCCUPIED TERRITORIES.  AT SAME TIME, HE SAID GOJ WAS  WILLING CONSIDER ANY AND ALL PROPOSALS FOR INTE- GRATION OF REPS ""OF ALL POLITICAL CURRENTS WITHIN PALESTINE RESISTANCE"" IN JORDANIAN DELEGATION AT GENEVA.  ASKED IF THIS IS REALISTIC POSSIBILITY IN VIEW OF PAST GOJ-FEDAYEEN RELATIONS, KING REPLIED: ""I ENVISAGE AN ASSOCIATION FOR BETTER OR WORSE.  WHY NOT FORGET THE PAST, SINCE RESPONSIBILITY FOR EVENTS OF SEPTEMBER (1970) WAS AT LEAST SHARED.  AS MATTER OF FACT, THOSE ARMED CLASHES NEVER OPPOSED MUR TWO PEOPLES, BUT WERE BETWEEN A GOVT. THREATENED WITH DESTRUCTION AND ANARCHIST GROUPS WHICH WERE AT ODDS AMONG THEMSELVES AND DID NOT KNOW WHAT THEY WANTED"".\n4. FUTURE STATUS OF WEST BANK: AFTER REITERATING HIS PROMISE TO ACCORD SELF-DETERMINATION TO WEST BANK PALESTINIANS FOLLOWING ISRAELI WITHDRAWAL, KING NOTED HEATEDLY THAT ""NO ONE CAN DENY WHAT HASPEMITES HAVE DONE FOR PALESTINE SINCE BEGINNING OF THIS CENTURY. CONFIDENTIAL WE HAVE GIVEN EVERYTHING IN LIVES AND TREASURE, AND ON THIS SUBJECT WE TAKE NO LESSONS FROM ANYONE.\n5. OCTOBER WAR: AFTER DEFENDING JORDANS ROLE IN OCTOBER WAR ON GROUNDS THAT OVERRIDING NEED TO DEFEND EAST JORDAN WITH LIMIED MEANS LEFT GOJ WITH ONLY LIMITED MILITARY POTENTIAL, KING NOTED EGYPT AND SYRIA HAD NEVER INFORMED HIM THAT FIGHTING WOULD BEGIN ON OCT. 6 OR ANY OTHER DATE.  SAID THAT IN HIS CAIRO TALKS WITH SADAT AND ASSAD IN EARLY SEPTEMBER, ""WE TALKED ABOUT EVERYTHING EXCEPT WAR . . . NOT ONE WORD ABOUT H-HOUR FOR THE BATTLE"".  KING ALSO DENIGRATED FEDAYEEN MILITARY PERFORMANCE DURING OCTOBER FIGHTING, POINTING OUT HIS REFUSAL TO ALLOW COMMANDOS TO TRANSIT EAST JORDAN STEMMED FROM BELIEF THAT ""ONLY PLACE FOR FEDAYEEN ON BATTLEFIELD WAS INSIDE PALESTINE"" AND THAT THEY HAD MADE NO CONTRIBUTION IN THIS RESPECT.\n6. RELATIONS WITH U.S.: ASKED IF HE WAS SATISFIED WITH EVOLUTION IN JORDAN(S RALATIONSHIP WITH U.S., KING RESPONDED COLDLY: ""WE PUT OUR CONFIDENCE IN NO ONE.  WE ARE NOT SATISFIED WITH ANYBODYS ATTITUDE, AND OUR INITIATIVES ARE DICTATED BY OPPOR- TUNITIES AS THEY ARISE.  RELATIONS BETWEEN COUNTRIES ARE NEVER STABLE, AND WE MUST ACCOMMODATE OURSELVES TO THE REQUIREMENTS OF (VARIOUS) CIRCUMSTANCES"".\n7. E E E E E E E E\n",687467

SUMMARY: COMMENTING ON RECENT ALGIERS SUMMIT CONFERENCE, FOREIGN MINISTER BENHIMA EMPHASIZES IMPOR- TANCE TO ARABS OF ISRAELI PERFORMANCE ON CEASEFIRE AGREEMENT. REPORTS FAISAL INSTRANSIGENT ON OIL QUESTION AND PARTICULARLY HARD ON HOLLAND. END SUMMARY.\n2. IN CONVERSATION DECEMBER 3 WITH FOREIGN MINISTER BENHIMA I TOLD HIM WE WERE VERY KEEN ON LEARNING ABOUT RESULTS OF ALGIERS CONFERENCE AND I WAS CERTAIN USG WOULD LIKE HEAR KINGS VIEWS AS WELL AS HIS OWN. BEN- HIMA REPLIED THAT HE WAS CERTAIN KING WOULD SEE ME SOON (APPOINTMENT NOW SET FOR AFTERNOON DECEMBER 5), CONFIDENTIAL AND HE THEN GAVE ME THE FOLLOWING ACCOUNT.\n3. CONFEREES HAD DISCUSSED MILITARY SITUATION, CLASSI- FICATION OF VARIOUS COUNTRIES IN TERMS ELIGIBILITY FOR OIL EXPORTS, ATTITUDE TOWARDS RUSSIA, AND ECONOMIC MOBI- LIZATION. CONFEREES DID NOT HAVE LONG DISCUSSION ON MILITARY EVENTS BECAUSE MOROCCAN DELEGATION HAD SAID THIS WAS MATTER FOR GENERAL STAFFS, NOT FOR POLITICIANS TO DECIDE; EGUPTIANS HAD GONE TO WAR ON OCTOBER 6 WITHOUT CONSULTING OTHER COUNTRIES, BUT OTHERS WERE SUPPORTING THEM LOYALLY AND WOULD CONTINUE TO DO SO. NEVERTHELESS, SUMMIT MEETING SHOULD NOT BE USED FOR DISCUSSION THAT SUPPORT UNLESS THERE CONCRETE INFORMATION FROM ARAB COMMANDERS INDICATING SOME NEW COMMITMENT NEEDED.\n4. BENHIMA EMPHASIZED THAT ONE OF  MOST DIFFICULT PROB- LEMS WAS ISRAELI UNWILLINGNESS HONOR AGREEMENTS. HE SAID SADAT COULD HOPE TO HAVE HIS WAY TO ALGIERS ONLY BECAUSE TWO SUPER POWERS, US AND USSR, HAD GUARANTEED ISRAELI COMPLIEANCE WITH CESAE FIRE AGREEMENT, BUT FACT NEITHER US NOR SOVIETS ABLE THUS FAR COMPEL ISRAEL TO OBSERVE AGREEMENT REGARDING WITHDRAWAL WAS OMINOUS. CREDIBILITY OF US AND OF SECRETARY KISSINGER HAD BEEN WEAKENED BY LACK OF PROGRESS THIS ISSUE, AND SO HAD SADATS.\n5. ON QUESTION PALESTINIAN REPRESENTATION, A NUMBER OF COUNTRIES WERE QUICK TO ABANDON HUSSEIN. ALGERIA AND TUNISIA DID SO IN INSULTING TERMS. MOROCCO HAD SPOKEN IN FOVOR OF KING HUSSEINS POINT OF VIEW, DEFENDING HIS PROPOSAL FOR A REFERENDUM IN THAT PART OF PALESTINE NOW OCCUPIED BY ISRAEL. MOROCCO HAD URGED SUPPORT FOR THOSE CHIEFS OF STATE WHO FELT THEY COULD GET JORDAN AND THE PALESTINIANS TOGETHER AGAIN, BUT THERE HAD BEEN A CRISIS OF CONFIDENCE BETWEEN THE TWO. MOROCCAN EFFORTS FURTHERMORE HAMPERED BY BLATANT PARTIALITY OF ALGERIAN CHAIRMAN, WHO CONSTANTLY RULED AGAINST JORDANIAN. FAISAL ALSO SUPPORTED MOROCCAN POINT OF VIEW AND S\n5. ON OIL, FAISAL WAS ABSOLUTLEY INTRANSIGENT. HE SAID HE HAD GONE DOWN TO THE WIRE SUPPORTING AMERICANS AND HAD BEEN ACCUSED AND ISOLATED BY OTHER ARABS, WHO HAD SAID HE WAS AN AMERICAN AGENT. BUT AMERICANS HAD NOT COME THROUGH, AND HE NOW OBLIGED TO DO ALL HE COULD TO SEE TO IT THAT HIS POINT OF VIEW ON PALESTINE PRE- VAILED. HOWEVER, BENHIMA SAID THAT BESIDES MOROCCO, MANY OTHERS WERE MORE UNDERSTANDING OF AMERICAN DILEMMA AND URGED A MORE FLEXIBLE APPROACH. AMONG THEM WERE KUWAIT, ABU DHABI, TUNISIA, EGYPT AND SUDAN.\n6. BENHIMA SAID HE HAD PLEADED FOR A MORE BENIGN ATTI- TUDE REGARDING HOLLAND BY FAISAL BUT FAISAL WAS PARTICU- LARLY HARD ON HOLLAND HE, BENHIMA, THINKS THAT HOLLAND WILL BE DEPRIVED OF OIL LONGER THAN ANYONE ELSE. MOROCCO AND ABU DHABI ALSO INTERCEDED FOR JAPAN TO GET THEM SAME STATUS AS FRANCE AND ENGLAND AND IS OPTIMISTIC THAT THIS WILL BE POSSIBLE.\n7. THERE WAS A GREAT DEAL OF CRITICISM OF QADHAFI, ESPE- CIALLY HIS PARIS PRESS CONFERENCE, AND A REALIZATION THAT THE USSR IS ALSO OPEN TO CRITICISM. TWO OR THREE ARAB MINISTERS WILL SHORTLY GO TO MOSCOW TO MAKE THAT POINT OF VIEW FELT.\n8. EVERYBODY APPRECIATED IMPROVEMENT IN US-ARAB RELATIONS, BUT FEAR WAS THAT IF THE US CANNOT GET ISRAEL TO MOVE ON THE FIRST POINT OF THE SIX-POINT AGREEMENT, HOW CAN ANY- THING ELSE BE ACHIEVED UNDER US AEGIS LATER AT GENEVA? US ABILITY TO BRING ABOUT A CHANGE IN ISRAELI ATTITUDE ON THE SIX POINTS IS TOUCHSTONE OF THE FUTURE. THE EUQSTION WAS RAISED TIME AND AGAIN, IS ISRAEL IMPOSING ITS WILL ON THE US?\n9. FONMIN SIAD THAT SECRETARY KISSINGERS VISIT TO CAIRO ON DECEMBER 13 HAS JUST BEEN ANNOUNCED AND THAT WAS GOOD BUT THAT THE PERFORMANCE OF THE ISRAELIS UNDER AMERICAN AUSPICES IS THE CHIEF ITEM.

  sponsored by the United States and the Soviet Union which calls for                        negotiations to start between the parties concerned under appropriate                        auspices aimed at establishing a just and durable peace in the Middle East                        The United States and the Soviet Union have now been informed by the parties                        concerned of their readiness to participate in the peace conference under                        the auspices of the United NationsIt is our understanding that Egypt Israel Jordan and Syria have agreed to                        participate from the outset in the conference which would begin in Geneva on                        December 18 The parties have agreed that the conference should be under the

      Lebanon will be discussed during the first stage of the conferenceIt is our hope that you will find it possible to participate in the opening                        phase of the conference at which it is expected that the governments                        concerned will be represented by their respective Foreign Ministers and                        later by their specially appointed

                  provided this additional paragraph in case Fahmi had any problem with the auspices issue                            Ibid5 I am repeating this internal telegram to Cairo for

revised draft letter Fahmi had exploded Fahmi charged that once again the United States was                            deferring to the Israelis while also giving them 3 billion for weapons                            to kill Arabs Fahmi said he was                            skeptical that the conference would even take place and insisted that                            confining its first phase to initial disengagement was not enough He                            warned that unless large or medium scale disengagement was agreed upon                            and finalized in the upcoming Geneva talks Egypt would not go back to                            the conference Eilts reported                            that he had pointed out that all he was asking was Egypts expeditious                            concurrence in a revised letter containing language that Fahmi himself had earlier accepted as                            satisfactory The Foreign Minister agreed wearily to submit

their readiness to participate in the peace conference under                        the auspices of the United NationsIt is our understanding that Egypt Israel Jordan and Syria have agreed to                        participate from the outset in the conference which would begin in Geneva on                        December 18 The parties have agreed that the conference should be under the                        cochairmanship of the United States and the Soviet Union The parties have                        also agreed that the question of the participation of the Palestinians and                        Lebanon will be discussed during the first stage of the conferenceIt is our hope that you will find it possible to participate in the opening                        phase of the conference at which it is expected that the governments                        concerned will be represented by their respective Foreign Ministers and                        later by their specially appointed representative with Ambassadorial rank                        We also hope that you can make available a representative who would keep you                        fully informed as the conference proceeds Finally we would also appreciate                        it if the United Nations could make appropriate arrangements for the                        necessary conference facilitiesWe request that you circulate this letter to members of the Security Council                        for their information We believe it would be appropriate for the President                        of the Security Council to consult informally with the membership with a                        view to securing a favorable consensus of the CouncilEnd text4 Eilts is also authorized

told Eilts that if Fahmi raised the point that the draft                            letter to the Secretary General made no direct reference to the                            conference being under UN auspices the                            Ambassador was authorized to suggest the following alternative language                            which would become the penultimate paragraph: If as we hope you will                            find it possible to participate as cochairmen the US and the Soviet                            Union would appreciate it if you would agree to serve as convener of the                            conference and preside in the opening phase The Secretary added that                            his own preference was for the draft as it stood but that he had                            provided this additional paragraph in case Fahmi had any problem with the auspices issue                            Ibid5 I am repeating this internal telegram to Cairo for

revised draft letter Fahmi had exploded Fahmi charged that once again the United States was                            deferring to the Israelis while also giving them 3 billion for weapons                            to kill Arabs Fahmi said he was                            skeptical that the conference would even take place and insisted that                            confining its first phase to initial disengagement was not enough He                            warned that unless large or medium scale disengagement was agreed upon                            and finalized in the upcoming Geneva talks Egypt would not go back to                            the conference Eilts reported                            that he had pointed out that all he was asking was Egypts expeditious                            concurrence in a revised letter containing language that Fahmi himself had earlier accepted as                            satisfactory The Foreign Minister agreed wearily to submit

40,0.8674386910710026,Tosec 60241816 Subj: Conversation With                        Israeli Ambassador For Secretary From Sisco1 I gave Dinitz Memorandum of                        Understanding which is reproduced in this telegram for the record saying                        that I assumed Israel would wish to give this matter further study I did                        not find it necessary to elaborate on the individual points since Dinitz found them selfexplanatory and                        provided me with several preliminary comments immediately He focussed on                        para 3 underscoring that their draft made it clear whereas ours did not                        that Israel would refuse to participate in the conference with Syria until                        Syria took the minimal actions indicated therein with respect to POWs I                        limited my remarks to saying that US was keenly aware of the importance                        Israel attaches to this question and that I was sure that POW question was one matter which you would be                        taking up in Damascus Dinitz                        reiterated that this is a highly emotional issue in Israel and that if we                        could accept their formulation it would make it less difficult for Mrs                            Meir in the Cabinet2 Dinitz also focussed on para 8                        stressing as you would expect that they are insisting on unanimity and that                        full omission in original their insistence in this regard did not come                        out of any doubt as to our own position but rather their concern over the                        position of other participants in the conference3 He also made a comment on para 9 saying that phrases like essentially                        nonsubstantive capacity and principal duty left open a possible                        substantive role for the SYG and his                        representative On this one he seemed less concerned than on the other two                        points4 Dinitz said our redraft would be                        carefully studied and that they would send their reaction to you via                            Scowcroft5 Following is the draft which I provided Dinitz:Begin text Memorandum of Understanding This                        Memorandum of Understanding is intended to express how Israel and the United                        States will approach their respective roles at the Geneva conference1 The Governments of Israel and the US agree that the Geneva conference is                        aimed at the attainment of a just and durable peace between the parties                        that this peace will be a contractual peace between Israel and its Arab                        neighbors and that the ultimate objective is full reconciliation between                        the two sides2 In the spirit of the special relationship that exists between our two                        countries the US will consult with Israel on a stepbystep basis with                        respect to any ideas it may wish to explore with the Soviets or with the                        Arabs concerning the settlement3 The US will make every effort along with the Government of Israel to                        seek a prompt resolution of the IsraeliSyrian POW problem This includes efforts with the Arab states as well                        as the USSR The US will make a major                        effort to encourage the Government of Syria to submit a list of Israeli                        POWs to permit the International Committee of the Red Cross to visit them and report that they are being                        treated in conformity with the Geneva Convention and to agree to a joint                        exchange of wounded POWs4 Israel reiterates its decision to observe scrupulously the ceasefire on                        land air and sea on a reciprocal basis The US will exercise its good                        offices in order to assure that the other side will abide by its undertaking                        to observe scrupulously the ceasefire5 All the existing arrangements with regard to the nonmilitary supply to                        the Third Army as well as the City of Suez will be maintained unless                        superseded by other arrangements mutually agreed6 The US will do its utmost to insure that the existing arrangement                        regarding the uninterrupted passage of ships through Babel Mandeb to and                        from Israel will remain in force and that Egypt will not apply any                        blockade measures7 Israel and the US would agree to the participation of Lebanon in the                        conference at an appropriate stage This undertaking is based on the                        assumption that disengagement of forces will be discussed at the outset of                        the conference8 It is understood that any possible additional participation at an                        appropriate phase of the conference will have to be decided upon after full                        consultation between all the initial participants No state group or                        organization will be invited to take part in the conference without full                        consultation between us The US will take fully into account in particular                        Israels views and those of Jordan9 The negotiations in the conference will be conducted between the parties                        concerned as specified in Resolution 338 Israel and the US agree that it                        is their view that the SYG should                        participate in the opening sessions in an essentially nonsubstantive                        capacity and that he can appoint a representative who would remain                        throughout the conference after he has left His principal duty would be to                        keep the SYG informed and to help assure                        that the technical and conference arrangements being provided by the UN                        are in order10 Since the negotiations between the parties are under USUSSR auspices it is expected that the two                        major powers will maintain close contact with each other and the negotiating                        parties At the same time it is the view of both Israel and the US that                        the prime focus should be negotiations between the parties concerned While                        SovietUS participation is to be expected at the beginning and                        subsequently at key points the US will work in concert with Israel to                        maximize opportunities for negotiations between the parties without the                        presence of either of the major powers11 In view of the fact that the Soviet Union does not maintain diplomatic                        relations with Israel the Government of Israel seriously questions the propriety and the feasibility of                        the Soviet Union acting as one of the two powers under whose auspices the                        conference is being held The US notes Israels reservations regarding the                        role of the Soviet Union at the conference The US will make every effort                        in its consultations with the Soviet Union to encourage it to play a                        constructive role at the conference12 As previously indicated to the Israeli Government the US will work to                        assure that Israel will not be faced with any important decisions of                        substance on the issues of a final peace settlement before the Israeli                        election of December 31 The US believes that it will be both desirable                        and necessary for the peace conference to deal with such issues at an early                        appropriate date in January13 The US will do its utmost to prevent any attempt to convene the UN Security Council or any other UN body for the purpose of discussing or taking                        action on any of the outstanding issues which were discussed at Kilometer                        101 or which will be discussed at the peace conference14 Israel and the US agree that nothing in this memorandum alters the text

41,0.8562918512635677,Tosec 60241816 Subj: Conversation With                        Israeli Ambassador For Secretary From Sisco1 I gave Dinitz Memorandum of                        Understanding which is reproduced in this telegram for the record saying                        that I assumed Israel would wish to give this matter further study I did                        not find it necessary to elaborate on the individual points since Dinitz found them selfexplanatory and                        provided me with several preliminary comments immediately He focussed on                        para 3 underscoring that their draft made it clear whereas ours did not                        that Israel would refuse to participate in the conference with Syria until                        Syria took the minimal actions indicated therein with respect to POWs I                        limited my remarks to saying that US was keenly aware of the importance                        Israel attaches to this question and that I was sure that POW question was one matter which you would be                        taking up in Damascus Dinitz                        reiterated that this is a highly emotional issue in Israel and that if we                        could accept their formulation it would make it less difficult for Mrs                            Meir in the Cabinet2 Dinitz also focussed on para 8                        stressing as you would expect that they are insisting on unanimity and that                        full omission in original their insistence in this regard did not come                        out of any doubt as to our own position but rather their concern over the                        position of other participants in the conference3 He also made a comment on para 9 saying that phrases like essentially                        nonsubstantive capacity and principal duty left open a possible                        substantive role for the SYG and his                        representative On this one he seemed less concerned than on the other two                        points4 Dinitz said our redraft would be                        carefully studied and that they would send their reaction to you via                            Scowcroft5 Following is the draft which I provided Dinitz:Begin text Memorandum of Understanding This                        Memorandum of Understanding is intended to express how Israel and the United                        States will approach their respective roles at the Geneva conference1 The Governments of Israel and the US agree that the Geneva conference is                        aimed at the attainment of a just and durable peace between the parties                        that this peace will be a

                      conference ought to be a peace settlement not carrying out any one                                UN resolution Ibid NSC Files Kissinger Office Files Box 136 Country Files Middle

ACCORDING TO ARTICLE BY YOSEF HARIF IN MAARIV, US HAS EXPLAINED TO ISRAEL IN REPLY TO GOI QUERY THAT REFERENCE IN RESOLUTION 338 TO "" AUSPICES"" FOR PEACE TALKS MEANS, AS FAR US IS CONCERNED, THAT US WILL ACT AS CATALYST AT GENEVA, TRYING TO HELP BRIDGE GAPS AND PREVENT CRISES IN COURSE OF CONFERENCE. HARIF SAYS THAT US ADDED THAT IT DID NOT KNOW HOW USSR INTER- PRETS TERM "" AUSPICES.""\n2. HARIF SAYS THAT OPENING SESSION AT PEACE CONFERENCE DEC 18 WILL BE OF CEREMONIAL NATURE ONLY AND WILL BE AT FOREIGN MINISTER LEVEL. DISCUSSION OF MATTERS OF SUBSTANCE WILL BE POSTPONED UNTIL AFTER ISRAELI ELECTIONS. HOWEVER, PERMANENT DELEGATIONS WILL REMAIN IN GENEVA AFTER OPENING SESSION AT LOWER LEVEL.\n3. ACCORDING TO HARIF, UN IS NOW BUSY ORGANIZING SECRETARIAT FOR GENEVA CONFERENCE AND MAKING ARRANGEMENTS FOR USE OF ITS GENEVA BUILDING, AND US IS BEHIND ALL THIS UN ACTIVITY BECAUSE OF ITS CONVICTION THAT VERY FACT OF HOLDING OPENING SESSION WILL CALM SITUATION IN MIDDLE EAST.\n4. HARIF CONTINUES THAT ISRAEL AND US HAVE AGREED THAT CONFERENCE SHOULD OPERATE THROUGH SUBCOMMITTEES COMPRISED OF ISRAEL AND EACH OF ITS NEIGHBORS TO SETTLE BILATERAL ISSUES; APPARENTLY ARAB STATES HAVE AGREED TO THIS. HARIF WRITES THAT OFFICIAL INVITATIONS TO CONFERENCE, TO BE SIGNED BY US AND USSR, WILL BE SENT TO THOSE COUNTRIES WHOSE PARTICIPATION HAS UNCLASSIFIED ALREADY BEEN DECIDED UPON--ISRAEL, EGYPT, SYRIA, AND JORDAN-- AFTER THEIR REACTION IS RECEIVED TO DRAFT INVITATION SUBMITTED TO THEM.\n5. HARIF ADDS THAT INVITATION WAS ALREADY SENT TO UNSYG WALDHEIM WHICH IS SIMILAR TO THOSE SENT TO PARTICIPATING COUNTRIES. ACCORDING TO HARIF, WALDHEIM HAS BEEN INVITED TO TAKE PART IN OPENING CEREMONY, TO APPOINT REPRESENTATIVE ON HIS BEHALF FOR DISCUSSIONS AT CONFERENCE, AND TO PLACE ADMINISTRATIVE SERVICES OF UN AT DISPOSAL OF CONFERENCE PARTICIPANTS. IN REPLY TO GOI QUESTION, IT WAS STATED (HARIF DOES NOT INDICATE BY WHOM) THAT ROLE OF WALDHEIM AND OF HIS REPRESENTATIVE WOULD BE THAT OF OBSERVER ONLY.\n6. ACCORDING TO HARIF, GOI HAS RAISED POINT ABOUT FORMULATION\n8."" HARIF ADDS ISRAEL HAS INFORMED US IT WILL NOT SIT DOWN FOR TALKS WITH SYRIA IF SYRIA DOES NOT FULFILL ITS OBLIGATIONS UNDER GENEVA CONVENTION, MEANING THAT SYRIA MUST IMMEDIATELY SUBMIT LIST OF POWS, INDICATED WHICH ARE WOUNDED, AND PERMIT ICRC VISITS TO POWS. HARIF SAYS THERE HAS ALSO BEEN SUGGESTION THAT ISRAEL NOT PARTICIPATE AT OPENING OF CONFERENCE IF SYRIA DOES NOT START ABIDING BY GENEVA CONVENTION FIRST.\n7. POSSIBILITY IS NOT TO BE RULED OUT, ACCORDING TO HARIF, THAT EVEN BEFORE OPENING SESSION OF CONFERENCE LEBANON WILL ALSO BE INVITED TO PARTICIPATE. HARIF SAYS ISRAELIS ARE PARTICULARLY INTERESTED IN THIS BECAUSE INVITATION TO LEBANON WOULD HIGHLIGHT FACT THAT THIS IS TO BE PEACE CONFERENCE AND NOT MERELY CON- FERENCE TO DISCUSS ISRAELI TROOP WITHDRAWALS\n8. AS FOR POSSIBLE INVITATIONS TO ADDITIONAL PARTICIPANTS, SUCH AS PALESTINIANS, HARIF WRITES THAT US AND ISRAEL HAVE AGREED THAT IF US WANTS TO ISSUE ADDITIONAL INVITATIONS, THIS WILL ONLY BE DONE AFTER UNANIMOUS AGREEMENT OF ORIGINAL PARTICIPANTS HAS BEEN OBTAINED. UNCLASSIFIED 9. HARIF SAYS THAT ISRAEL HAS TOLD US THAT IT SHOULD BE ENSURED THAT SUBSTANTIVE DISCUSSIONS AT CONFERENCE START ON SUBJECT OF NATURE OF PEACE. THIS MEANS, HARIF EXPLAINS, THAT ONLY IN LIGHT OF DEFINITION OF NATURE OF PEACE WILL THERE BE WAY TO DEAL WITH BOUNDARIES FROM SECURITY VIEWPOINT; ONE CAN ONLY EXPECT FLEXIBILITY FROM ISRAEL RE BOUNDARIES IF ISRAEL IS CONVINCED THAT NATURE OF THE PEACE ARABS HAVE IN MIND IS SATISFACTORY TO ISRAEL. HARIF ADDS THAT SO FAR, THERE IS NO AGREEMENT ON THIS POINT.\n0. HARIF CONTINUES THAT IT IS NOW CLEAR THAT FIRST SUBSTANTIVE SUBJECT AT CONFERENCE WILL BE DISENGAGEMENT OF FORCES, IN VIEW OF BREAKDOWN OF KM 101 TALKS. HARIF SAYS IT HAS BEEN POINTED OUT INJERUSALEM THAT SECRETARY KISSINGER REACHED CONCLUSION AT VERY EARLY STAGE THAT THERE WAS HARDLY A CHANCE EGYPT WOULD WANT TO REACH AGREEMENT AT KM 101 BEFORE GENEVA CONFERENCE, EVEN IF ISRAEL SHOWED FLEXIBILITY IN KM 101 TALKS, AS ISRAEL DID. THEREFORE, SECRETARY PROPOSED TRANSFER OF ISSUE OF DISENGAGEMENT TO GENEVA CONFERENCE. HARIF ADDS GOI IS INTERESTED IN CONTINUING KM 101 TALKS BECAUSE IT HAS BEEN POSSIBLE THERE TO DISCUSS VARIOUS OTHER EGYPTIAN-ISRAELI ISSUES AND ALSO BECAUSE THIS MIGHT HELP TO KEEP MIDDLE EAST CALM UNTIL DECEMBER 18.

is reproduced in this telegram for the record saying                        that I assumed Israel would wish to give this matter further study I did                        not find it necessary to elaborate on the individual points since Dinitz found them selfexplanatory and                        provided me with several preliminary comments immediately He focussed on                        para 3 underscoring that their draft made it clear whereas ours did not                        that Israel would refuse to participate in the conference with Syria until                        Syria took the minimal actions indicated therein with respect to POWs I                        limited my remarks to saying that US was keenly aware of the importance                        Israel attaches to this question and that I was sure that POW question was one matter which you would be                        taking up in Damascus Dinitz                        reiterated that this is a highly emotional issue in Israel and that if we                        could accept their formulation it would make it less difficult for Mrs                            Meir in the Cabinet2 Dinitz also focussed on para 8                        stressing as you would expect that they are insisting on unanimity and that                        full omission in original their insistence in this regard did not come                        out of any doubt as to our own position but rather their concern over the                        position of other participants in the conference3 He also made a comment on para 9 saying that phrases like essentially                        nonsubstantive capacity and principal duty left open a possible                        substantive role for the SYG and his                        representative On this one he seemed less concerned than on the other two                        points4 Dinitz said our redraft would be                        carefully studied and that they would send their reaction to you via                            Scowcroft5 Following is the draft which I provided Dinitz:Begin text Memorandum of Understanding This                        Memorandum of Understanding is intended to express how Israel and the United                        States will approach their respective roles at the Geneva conference1 The Governments of Israel and the US agree that the Geneva conference is                        aimed at the attainment of a just and durable peace between the parties                        that this peace will be a contractual peace between Israel and its Arab                        neighbors and that the ultimate objective is full reconciliation between                        the two sides2 In the spirit of the special relationship that exists between our two                        countries the US will consult with Israel on a stepbystep basis with                        respect to any ideas it may wish to explore with the Soviets or with the                        Arabs concerning the settlement3 The US will make every effort along with the Government of Israel to                        seek a prompt resolution of the IsraeliSyrian POW problem This includes efforts with the Arab states as well                        as the USSR The US will make a major                        effort to encourage the Government of Syria to submit a list of Israeli                        POWs to permit the International Committee of the Red Cross to visit them and report that they are being                        treated in conformity with the Geneva Convention and to agree to a joint                        exchange of wounded POWs4 Israel reiterates its decision to observe scrupulously the ceasefire on                        land air and sea on a reciprocal basis The US will exercise its good                        offices in order to assure that the other side will abide by its undertaking                        to observe scrupulously the ceasefire5 All the existing arrangements with regard to the nonmilitary supply to                        the Third Army as well as the City of Suez will be maintained unless                        superseded by other arrangements mutually agreed6 The US will do its utmost to insure that the existing arrangement                        regarding the uninterrupted passage of ships through Babel Mandeb to and                        from Israel will remain in force and that Egypt will not apply any                        blockade measures7 Israel and the US would agree to the participation of Lebanon in the                        conference at an appropriate stage This undertaking is based on the                        assumption that disengagement of forces will be discussed at the outset of                        the conference8 It is understood that any possible additional participation at an                        appropriate phase of the conference will have to be decided upon after full                        consultation between all the initial participants No state group or                        organization will be invited to take part in the conference without full                        consultation between us The US will take fully into account in particular                        Israels views and those of Jordan9 The negotiations in the conference will be conducted between the parties                        concerned as specified in Resolution 338 Israel and the US agree that it                        is their view that the SYG should                        participate in the opening sessions in an essentially nonsubstantive                        capacity and that he can appoint a representative who would remain                        throughout the conference after he has left His principal duty would be to                        keep the SYG informed and to help assure                        that the technical and conference arrangements being provided by the UN                        are in order10 Since the negotiations between the parties are under USUSSR auspices it is expected that the two                        major powers will maintain close contact with each other and the negotiating                        parties At the same time it is the view of both Israel and the US that                        the prime focus should be negotiations between the parties concerned While                        SovietUS participation is to be expected at the beginning and                        subsequently at key points the US will work in concert with Israel to                        maximize opportunities for negotiations between the parties without the                        presence of either of the major powers11 In view of the fact that the Soviet Union does not maintain diplomatic                        relations with Israel the Government of Israel seriously questions the propriety and the feasibility of                        the Soviet Union acting as one of the two powers under whose auspices the                        conference is being held The US notes Israels reservations regarding the                        role of the Soviet Union at the conference The US will make every effort                        in its consultations with the Soviet Union to encourage it to play a                        constructive role at the conference12 As previously indicated to the Israeli Government the US will work to                        assure that Israel will not be faced with any important decisions of                        substance on the issues of a final peace settlement before the Israeli                        election of December 31 The US believes that it will be both desirable                        and necessary for the peace conference to deal with such issues at an early                        appropriate date in January13 The US will do its utmost to prevent any attempt to convene the UN Security Council or any other UN body for the purpose of discussing or taking                        action on any of the outstanding issues which were discussed at Kilometer                        101 or which will be discussed at the peace conference14 Israel and the US agree that nothing in this memorandum alters the text                        of the joint USUSSR letter which will                        be despatched to the UNSYG upon receipt of the approval of the                        parties concerned End textIn telegram

Understanding Dinitz had given him Israeli suggestions on the rules of                            procedure that should govern the conference Sisco had replied that he would study them but noted                            that the United States had not yet decided if it would be necessary for                            the conference to decide formally on rules of procedure The proposed                            rules suggested two initial meetings and then adjournment Shalev who was also present noted                            that there was no specific mention of disengagement as the subject

resolution of the IsraeliSyrian POW problem This includes efforts with the Arab states as well                        as the USSR The US will make a major                        effort to encourage the Government of Syria to submit a list of Israeli                        POWs to permit the International Committee of the Red Cross to visit them and report that they are being                        treated in conformity with the Geneva Convention and to agree to a joint                        exchange of wounded POWs4 Israel reiterates its decision to observe scrupulously the ceasefire on                        land air and sea on a reciprocal basis The US will exercise its good                        offices in order to assure that the other side will abide by its undertaking                        to observe scrupulously the ceasefire5 All the existing arrangements with regard to the nonmilitary supply to                        the Third Army as well as the City of Suez will be maintained unless                        superseded by other arrangements mutually agreed6 The US will do its utmost to insure that the existing arrangement                        regarding the uninterrupted passage of ships through Babel Mandeb to and                        from Israel will remain in force and that Egypt will not apply any                        blockade measures7 Israel and the US would agree to the participation of Lebanon in the                        conference at an appropriate stage This undertaking is based on the                        assumption that disengagement of forces will be discussed at the outset of                        the conference8 It is understood that any possible additional participation at an                        appropriate phase of the conference will have to be decided upon after full                        consultation between all the initial participants No state group or                        organization will be invited to take part in the conference without full                        consultation between us The US will take fully into account in particular                        Israels views and those of Jordan9 The negotiations in the conference will be conducted between the parties                        concerned as specified in Resolution 338 Israel and the US agree that it                        is their view that the SYG should                        participate in the opening sessions in an essentially nonsubstantive                        capacity and that he can appoint a representative who would remain                        throughout the conference after he has left His principal duty would be to                        keep the SYG informed and to help assure                        that the technical and conference arrangements being provided by the UN                        are in order10 Since the negotiations between the parties are under USUSSR auspices it is expected that the two                        major powers will maintain close contact with each other and the negotiating                        parties At the same time it is the view of both Israel and the US that                        the prime focus should be negotiations between the parties concerned While                        SovietUS participation is to be expected at the beginning and                        subsequently at key points the US will work in concert with Israel to                        maximize opportunities for negotiations between the parties without the                        presence of either of the major powers11 In view of the fact that the Soviet Union does not maintain diplomatic                        relations with Israel the Government of Israel seriously questions the propriety and the feasibility of                        the Soviet Union acting as one of the two powers under whose auspices the                        conference is being held The US notes Israels reservations regarding the                        role of the Soviet Union at the conference The US will make every effort                        in its consultations with the Soviet Union to encourage it to play a                        constructive role at the conference12 As previously indicated to the Israeli Government the US will work to                        assure that Israel will not be faced with any important decisions of                        substance on the issues of a final peace settlement before the Israeli                        election of December 31 The US believes that it will be both desirable                        and necessary for the peace conference to deal with such issues at an early                        appropriate date in January13 The US will do its utmost to prevent any attempt to convene the UN Security Council or any other UN body for the purpose of discussing or taking                        action on any of the outstanding issues which were discussed at Kilometer                        101 or which will be discussed at the peace conference14 Israel and the US agree that nothing in this memorandum alters the text                        of the joint USUSSR letter which will                        be despatched to the UNSYG upon receipt of the approval of the                        parties concerned End textIn telegram

               rules suggested two initial meetings and then adjournment Shalev who was also present noted                            that there was no specific mention of disengagement as the subject of                            the initial session although Israel had no objection to that being the                            first subject of discussion He emphasized that the objective of the

IN RECENT CONVERSATION WITH KUWAIT FONMIN SABAH AL-AHMAD, I ASKED HIM HOW HE SAW UPCOMING GENEVA CONFERENCE AND GENERAL AREA SITUATION SHAPING UP AT THIS PARTICULAR MOMENT IN TIME.\n2. SABAH SAID EGYPTIAN PRESIDENT SADAT HAD DONE ALL HE POSSIBLY COULD TO ENCOURAGE PEACEFUL SOLUTION AND HE NOW IN HIGHLY VULNERABLE POSITION. GREAT MANY ARABS THOUGHT HE HAD DANGEROUSLY COMPROMISED HIS POSITION, AND THIS VIEW WOULD OBVIOUSLY TURN OUT TO BE RIGHT IF HE WAS NOW ECLIPSED. US MUST INCREASE ITS PUBLIC SUPPORT OF SADAT, AND THAT MEANT HELPING SADAT TO GET QUICK TANGIBLE RESULTS AT GENEVA CONFERENCE. IF SOMEONE LIKE BAKR OR SADDAM HUSSEIN OF IRAQ WERE TO TAKE OVER REINS IN EGYPT, IT WOULD NOT ONLY SPELL DEEP TROUBLE FOR MODERATE ARABS BUT COULD BRING ABOUT MAJOR NEW US-SOVIET CONFRONTATION.\n3. I SAID, SPEAKING PERSONALLY, I AGREED SADAT NEEDED AND DESERVED SUPPORT BUT OVERALL SITUATION MUST BE SEEN IN PERSPECTIVE. THERE WAS NO WAY ISRAEL WAS GOING TO WITHDRAW AS LONG AS IT BELIEVED THAT BY SO DOING IT WOULD SERIOUSLY WEAKEN ITS DEFENSES. REARMAMENT OF ISRAEL WAS NOT TO PERPETUATE ISRAELI OCCUPATION OF POST 1967 TERRITORIES BUT TO MAKE AS SECURE AS POSSIBLE ISRAEL AS DEFINED BY UN RES 242 -- A RESOLUTION ACCEPTED BY ALL SIDES. WITH PRESENT ISRAELI LEADERSHIP ENCOUNTERING ROUGH SLEDDING INSIDE ISRAEL AND ELECTIONS COMING UP, I SAID, APPEARED TO ME ISRAELI POSITION COULD VERY EASILY BECOME MORE HAWKISH THAN BEFORE IF ITS SECURITY CON- CERNS NOT MET. WE ASSUMED ARABS WOULD REFUSE COMPROMISE THEIR VITAL INTERESTS AND ISRAELIS MUST BE EXPECTED TO FEEL SAME WAY.\n4. FONMIN SAID IN ANY CASE SADAT MUST BE SUPPORTED AT ALL COSTS, AND US SHOULD AVOID ANY ACTION WHICH WEAKENED HIM. AS FOR KUWAITS ROLE IN MID EAST DISPUTE, IT WAS TO PROVIDE FULL ASSISTANCE TO CON- FRONTATION STATES BUT NON-INVOLVEMENT, IN ANY ASPECT, DIRECT OR IN- DIRECT, IN THEIR NEGOTIATIONS WITH ISRAEL. KUWAIT WOULD ACCEPT WHAT- EVER CONFRONTATION STATES WORKED OUT WITH ISRAEL REGARDING RETURN OF THEIR TERRITORIES, "" AND IT NOT UP TO US KUWAITIS"", SABAH SAID, TO ""QUIBBLE ABOUT A FEW METERS OF EGYPTIAN OR SYRIAN LAND HERE OR THERE IF THE EGYPTIANS OR SYRIANS THEMSELVES DO NOT."" HOWEVER, SAID FON CONFIDENTIAL MIN, IN VIEW DEPTH OF PALESTINIAN INFLUENCE IN KUWAIT, GOK IN NO POSITION BE COMPROMISING ON SUBJECT OF PALESTINAINS. THEY WOULD HAVE TO BE ACCOMMODATED SOMEHOW, AND IN ABSENCE SATISFACTORY ACHIEVEMENT OF ""PALESTINAIN RIGHTS"" (WHATEVER THAT MEANT), KUWAIT WOULD CONTINUE SUPPORT AIMS OF PALESTINIANS EVEN IF THEY HAD NO ONE ELSE IN WORLD TO TURN TO.\n5. I SAID KUWAITI NON-INVOLVEMENT IN NEGOTIATIONS WITH ISRAEL MADE SENSE. HOWEVER, ONE WOULD HAVE THOUGHT KUWAITIS WOULD ENCOURAGE, NOT OPPOSE US EFFORTS TO HELP FIND PEACEFUL SOLUTION; AND YET KUWAITIS, ESPECIALLY YOUNGER ONES, SEEMED CURIOUSLY MORE NEGATIVE NOW THAN BEFORE OCTOBER WAR  WHEN PROSPECTS FOR MOVEMENT TOWARD PEACE SEEMED MUCH DIMMER. I SAID I FOUND THIS PHENOMENON RATHER DEPRESSING. IT WAS AS THOUGH KUWAITI YOUTH WAS AFRAID THAT SETTLEMENT WOULD SPELL END OF OPPORTUNITIES FOR MILITANT ACTION OR THAT ARABS ARE ONCE AGAIN ABOUT TO BE HUMILIATED BY UNITED STATES AND ISRAEL. WHY COULD NOT KUWAITIS, WHO LIKED TO THINK BIG, SEE THAT JUST SETTLEMENT WOULD OPEN UP TREMENDOUS NEW POSSI- BILITIES FOR GROWTH AND STRENGTHENING OF ARAB NATION?\n6. FONMIN CONTENTED HIMSLEF WITH REPLY THAT RESENTMENT OF ISRAEL AND US SUPPORT OF ISRAEL WAS DEEP AND OF LONG STANDING. HE ADDED THAT KUWAITIS STILL TRYING GET OVER SHOCK OF MASSIVE US ARMS  RE- SUPPLY OF ISRAEL SINCE EARLY IN OCTOBER WAR, AN ACTION WHICH DEFIED THEIRCOMPREHENSION. IT APPEARED TO MAN IN STREET THAT US MORE ANXIOUS TO DEFEND ISRAEL EVEN THAN USA ITSELF, AND THAT US INTEN- TIONALLY ATTACKING ARABS THROUGH ISRAEL. IN DEMOCRATIC KUWAIT NO ONE NEED BE AFRAID IN EXPRESSING HIS OPINION, HE SAID, NOR COULD ANYONE STOP HIS DOING SO. AS FAR AS OFFICIAL GOK POSITION WAS CONCERNED, SAIDFONMIN, GOVT BELIEVED IT BEST AVOID THOSE CONTACTS AND GRATUITOUS STATEMENTS THAT MIGHT BE HARD TO LIVE WITH LATER. ""OUR SILENCE IS OUR ENCOURAGEMENT"", HE SAID.\n7. I OBSERVED SUCH AN ATTITUDE DID NOT STRIKE A VERY POSITIVE NOTE. HOWEVER, MAIN POINT WAS THAT US EFFORTS MUST BE GIVEN CHANCE TO WORK. PROCESS FINDING EQUITABLE PEACE WOULD TAKE TIME -- PROBABLY LONGER THAN ARABS WOULD LIKE OR SEEMED TO THINK REASONABLE. SABAH JUST SHOOK HIS HEAD.\n8. FONMIN SABAH AGREED WITH ME THAT CODEL VISITS TO KUWAIT WERE A CONFIDENTIAL GOOD THING -- THE MORE THE BETTER. STOLTZFUS\n",690349
44,0.8268393657379058,Tosec 60241816 Subj: Conversation With                        Israeli Ambassador For Secretary From Sisco1 I gave Dinitz Memorandum of                        Understanding which is reproduced in this telegram for the record saying                        that I assumed Israel would wish to give this matter further study I did                        not find it necessary to elaborate on the individual points since Dinitz found them selfexplanatory and                        provided me with several preliminary comments immediately He focussed on                        para 3 underscoring that their draft made it clear whereas ours did not                        that Israel would refuse to participate in the conference with Syria until                        Syria took the minimal actions indicated therein with respect to POWs I                        limited my remarks to saying that US was keenly aware of the importance                        Israel attaches to this question and that I was sure that POW question was one matter which you would be                        taking up in Damascus Dinitz                        reiterated that this is a highly emotional issue in Israel and that if we                        could accept their formulation it would make it less difficult for Mrs                            Meir in the Cabinet2 Dinitz also focussed on para 8                        stressing as you would expect that they are insisting on unanimity and that                        full omission in original their insistence in this regard did not come                        out of any doubt as to our own position but rather their concern over the                        position of other participants in the conference3 He also made a comment on para 9 saying that phrases like essentially                        nonsubstantive capacity and principal duty left open a possible                        substantive role for the SYG and his                        representative On this one he seemed less concerned than on the other two                        points4 Dinitz said our redraft would be                        carefully studied and that they would send their reaction to you via                            Scowcroft5 Following is the draft which I provided Dinitz:Begin text Memorandum of Understanding This                        Memorandum of Understanding is intended to express how Israel and the United                        States will approach their respective roles at the Geneva conference1 The Governments of Israel and the US agree that the Geneva conference is                        aimed at the attainment of a just and durable peace between the parties                        that this peace will be a contractual peace between Israel and its Arab                        neighbors and that the ultimate objective is full reconciliation between                        the two sides2 In the spirit of the special relationship that exists between our two                        countries the US will consult with Israel on a stepbystep basis with                        respect to any ideas it may wish to explore with the Soviets or with the                        Arabs concerning the settlement3 The US will make every effort along with the Government of Israel to                        seek a prompt

JORDANIAN PRIME MINISTER AND FOREIGN MINISTER ZAID RIFAI, OBVIOUSLY WITH EYE TO PROTECTING FLANKS IN ARAB WORLD, GAVE CONSIDERABLY MORE HARD-LINE SPEECH THAN FAHMY, WITH EXTENSIVE ATTACKS ON ISRAEL AND MINIMAL EMPHASIS ON NEED FOR PEACEFUL SETTLEMENT.\n6. WHEN CONFERENCE RECONVENED FOR AFTERNOON SESSION, EBAN DELIVERED MODERATE SPEECH WHICH, WHIILE EXPRESSING SKEPTICISM CONFIDENTIAL RE ARAB INTENTIONS, CONSTITUTED ELOQUENT PLEA FOR RECON- CILIATION. IN ONLY EXERCISE OF RIGHT OF REPLY, FAHMY DELIVERED POLEMICAL, INTEMPERATE AND SOMEWHAT RAMBLING COMMENTARY ON EBANS SPEECK,ACCUSING EBAN AMONG OTHER THINGS OF PLAYING TO ISRAELI DOMESTIC OPINION IN ELECTORAL CAMPAIGN, WHILE HIMSELF OBVIOUSLY MAKING POINTS FOR ARAB HOME CONSUMPTION.\n7. BEFORE ADJOURNING AFTERNOON SESSION, WALDHEIM ANNOUNCED THERE WOULD BE CLOSED MEETING AT 11:00 AM SATURDAY, TO REVIEW WORKING PROCEDURES FOR CONFERENCE. GROMYKO INTERJECTED THAT HE ASSUMED QUESTIONS OF SUBSTANCE ALSO COULD BE RAISED, TO WHICH NO OBJECTIONS WERE RAISED.\n8. FOLLOWING ARE SUMMARIES OF SPEECHES AT TODAYS OPENING SESSION.\n9. WALDHEIM IN HIS OPENING REMARKS REMINDED CONFERENCE PARTI- CIPKKTS OF INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITYS CONCERN REGARDING SUCCESS OF THEIR UNDERTAKING AND POINTED OUT THAT SECURITY COUNCIL HAD EXPRESSED HOPE THAT CONFERENCE WOULD MAKE SPEEDY PROGRESS. UN HAS BEEN SEIZED OF MIDDLE EAST CONFLICT FOR PAST\n1. HE EXPRESSED HOPE THAT CONFERENCE WOULD MAKE PROGRESS ON DISENGAGEMENT, AND AT LATER STAGE ON PEACE, AND OFFERED UN ASSISTANCE IN ATTAINING THESE GOALS.\n0. GROMYKO FOLLOWED WITH RELATIVELY SHORT, RESTRAINED SPEECH. STRESSED DANGER THAT ARAB-ISRAELI CONFLICT PRESENTED TO REGIONAL, AS  WELL AS WORLD PEACE IF THE BASIS CAUSES OF DISPUTE WERE NOT RESOLVED. SAID ARABS WOULD NEVER AGREE TO LOSS OF THEIR TERRITORY THAT WAS OCCUPIED IN 1967, AND SOVIETS WLD GIVE THEM SUPPORT\n1. GROMYKO SAID MOST IMPORTANT PRINCIPLE IN APPROACH TO MIDDLE EAST PEACE IS THAT CITED IN S.C. RES. 242, VIZ. CONFIDENTIAL INADMISSIBILITY OF ACQUISITION OF TERRITORY BY WAR. AS LONG AS ISRAELI FORCES REMAINED ON ARAB TERRITORY, THERE WOULD BE NO PEACE. SAID ANY DOCUMENT DRAFTED BY THIS CONF SHOULD BE CLEAR-CUT DECLARATION TO ISRAEL TO VACATE OCCUPIED TERRITORY. WITHOUT THIS, CONF WOULD NOT PRODUCE RESULTS; WITH IT ALL OTHER PROBLEMS, INCLUDING THAT OF PALESTINIANS, COULD BE READILY RESOLVED.\n2. NOTING VERY EXISTENCE OF ISRAEL HAD BEEN BROUGHT ABOUT BY UN RESOLUTION, GROMYKO SAID IT WAS CLEAR THAT ALL STATES HAVE RIGHT TO EXISTENCE, BUT THIS COULD NOT BE ""UNILATERAL RIGHT"" WHICH IGNORED RIGHTS OF OTHERS. RIGHT OF EXISTENCE ENTAILED MUTUAL OBLIGATIONS WITH OTHER STATES. GROMYKO SAID SC RES. 242 STILL REPRESENTED REALISTIC APPROACH TO PEACE SETTLEMENT. CALLED ON CONF TO PRODUCE ""CONCRETE, REALISTIC PROPOSAL"" WHICH WOULD IMPLEMENT RES. 242. HE SAID AGREEMENT REACHED BETWEEN PARTIES SHOULD BE EMBODIED IN CONF DOCUMENTS, WHICH HE SAID SHOULD BE ""WEIGHTY"" DOCUMENTS, HAVING FORCE OF LAW. OBLIGATION THUS ASSUMED UNDER INTERNATIONAL LAW WOULD BE BEST GUARANTEE FOR MUTUAL SECURITY.IF ADDITIONAL GUARANTEES PROVED NECESSARY, USSR TAKING INTO ACCOUNT INTERESTS OF OTHER PARTIES, WOULD BE WILLING TO ACCEPT ADDITIONAL RESPONSIBILITY OF FURTHER GUARANTEES. HE SAID SECURITY COUNCIL WOULD ALSO HAVE ROLE ALONG THESE LINES WHICH COULD BE WORKED OUT IN THE NEGOTIATIONS.\n3. REFERRING AGAIN TO DANGERS OF RENEWED HOSTILITIES, GROMYKO NEVERTHELESS EXPRESSED HOPE CONF COULD PRODUCE RELIABLE PEACE. SAID SOVIET UNION WAS NOT HOSTILE TO ISRAEL PER SE, ONLY TO POLICY OF ANNEXATION. CONCLUDED BY SAYING SOVIET UNION WOULD DO EVERYTHING IN ITS POWER TO MAKE CONF SUCCEED AND SEE IT PROCEED IN CONSTRUCTIVE, EFFECTIVE MANNER.\n4. EGYPTIAN FOREIGN MINISTER FAHMY DELIVERED GENERALLY MODERATE ADDRESS. FAHMY SAID MIDDLE EAST HAS SUFFERED FROM MILITARISTIC AND EXPANSIONIST POLICY OF ISRAEL WHICH HAS SERIOUSLY ENDANGERED INDEPENDENCE AND TERRITORIAL INTEGRITY OF COUNTRIES IN AREA. HOWEVER, HE DID NOT WISH TO DWELL ON THIS. EGYPT HOPED THAT AS RESULT OF OCTOBER WAR ISRAELIS HAD DECIDED TO ""CHANGE THEIR COURSE TOWARDS THE ROAD TO DURABLE AND JUST PEACE"". FAHMY SAID THAT HIS PRESENCE IN GENEVA CONFIDENTIAL SYMBOLIZED EGYPTS DEEP DESIRE TO RESTORE REGION TO DURABLE AND JUST PEACE. ARAB COUNTRIES HAVE COME TO CONFERENCE ""READY AND PREPARED TO LAY THE CORNERSTONE OF THE EDIFICE OF PEACE IN THE MIDDLE EAST."" FAHMY SAID CHANCES OF REPEATING SUCH A HISTORICAL GATHERING WOULD BE REMOTE AND IF CONF DOES NOT SUCCEED, THERE WILL NO DOUBT BE ""RECOURSE TO OTHER MEANS"" BY ARABS TO LIBERATE THEIR LANDS AND TO RESTORE RIGHTS OF PALESTINIANS.\n5. FAHMY SAID HE VIEWED PARTICIPATION OF SOVIET UNION AND UNITED STATES IN COF AS ""A GOOD OMEN"" AND ""EVIDENCE OF THEIR WISH TO GUARANTEE THAT PEACEFUL AND JUST SETTLEMENT WILL PREVAIL IN MIDDLE EAST"". HE THEN LISTED FOLLOWING FIVE BASIC ""ESSENTIALS"" FOR PEACE:\n7.\n6. FAHMY CLOSED WITH STATEMENT THAT EGYPT IS PREPARED TO HONOR OBLIGATIONS EMANATING FROM RESOLUTION 242 AND WITH CALL FOR US AND USSR TO WORK FOR SUCCESS OF CONF.\n7. PRIME MINISTER RIFAI OF JORDAN LED OFF WITH A BRIEF HISTORICAL REVIEW CHARGING ISRAEL WITH MILITARY EXPANSION AND YET FAILING TO GAIN ACCEPTANCE IN WORLD. HE SAID IT WAS CLEAR THAT SC RES 242 ENDORSED RETURN OF ALL ARAB TERRITORIES OCCUPIED IN 1967, INCLUDING SYRIAN TERRITORY, THROUGH (A) ITS CONFIDENTIAL ENDORSEMENT PRINCIPLE OF INADMISSIBILITY OF ACQUISITION OF TERRITORY BY WAR AND (B) ITS CALL FOR ISRAELI WITHDRAWAL FROM THE (SIC) TERRITORIES OCCUPIED IN 1967. HE SAID IN JORDANS VIEW PRINCIPLE OF WITHDRAWAL IS INDIVISIBLE. RIFAI PROCEEDED TO IDENTIFY FOLLOWING SIX ISSUES IN ""CONSTRUCTION OF PEACE"":\n8. IN CONCLUSION, RIAFI SAID SOLUTION TO ME CONFLICT IS CONFIDENTIAL COMMON CONCERN AMONG ARAB STATES AND IS COLLECTIVE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THEM. JORDAN IS THEREFORE NOT PREPARED TO CONCLUDE ANY PARTIAL SETTLEMENT THAT IT FEELS IS OF JOINT INTEREST WITH OTHER ARABS AT CONFERENCE.\n9. EBAN GAVE ELOQUENT, CONSTRUCTIVE AND FOR MOST PART FORWARD-LOOKING SPEECH OF ABOUT 40 MINUTES DURATION-THE LONGEST OF THE DAY. STRESSED PEACE CONFERENCE WILL BE NEW OPPORTUNITY TO BREAK CYCLE OF VIOLENCE IN MIDDLE EAST. HE DID NOT KNOW IF IT WOULD SUCCEED IN THIS FORMIDABLE TASK, BUT PLEDGED ISRAELS BEST EFFORT. SAID TASK WOULD NOT BE EASY, AND IT WOULD BE UNREALISTIC TO EXPECT RAPID PROGRESS. ISRAEL COULD NOT IGNORE EXPERIENCE OF PAST, BUT ON OTHER HAND IT WOULD NOT ALLOW THAT EXPERIENCE TO PRODUCE DESPAIR.\n0. EBAN SAID CENTRAL QUESTION BEFORE THIS CONFERENCE WOULD BE WHETHER THE STATES CONCERNED COULD BREAK OUT OF OLD DEADLOCKS INTO ""NEW VISION"" OF PEACE FOR MIDDLE EAST. TO START WITH, IT WAS VITAL THAT CEASE-FIRE BE OBSERVED ON LAND, AIR AND SEA. EBAN INVITED CONFEREES TO COMMIT THEMSELVES ANEW TO OBSERVANCE OF CEASE-FIRE. THIS WAS INDISPENSABLE CONDITION FOR FURTHER NEGOTIATIONS. BEYOND THIS, ISRAELS GOAL WAS PEACE TREATY WHICH WOULD DEFINE TERMS OF ISRAELS EXISTENCE IN REGION IN FUTURE YEARS. SIMPLE EXTENSION OF CEASE-FIRE OR ARMISTICE WOULD NOT BE SUFFICIENT, NOR WOULD MERE ABSENCE OF WAR. NEITHER COULD PEACE SETTLEMENT REST ON DOCUMENTS ALONE. EBAN DEFINED ISRAELS GOAL AS CREATION OF ""COMMON REGIONAL INTERESTS OF SUCH INTENSITY"", AND ""SUCH ENTANGLEMENT OF MUTUAL ADVANTAGE"", AS TO PLACE RENEWAL OF WARFARE OUTSIDE OF REALM OF PROBABILITY.\n1. EBAN SAID PEACE TREATY SHOULD BE FREELY ARRIVED AT, SHOULD PUT AN END TO BOYCOTT AND BLOCKADE, PROVIDE FOR PREVENTION OF USE OF FORCE, PROHIBIT ANY HOSTILE ACTION, INCLUDING TERRORISM AND PROCLAIM PERMANENT END OF CONFLICT. EBAN SAID ISRAEL WILL SEEK TO LEARN FROM ARABS AT GENEVA WHETHER THEY SHARE ITS VISION OF PEACE; IF SO THERE WILL STILL BE MANY DIFFICULTIES BUT THE TASK WILL BE MUCH EASIER. DECISIVE TEST FOR ISRAEL, EBAN SAID, WILL BE DEFENSIBILITY OF ITS BOUNDARIES; THERE CANNOT BE RETURN TO FORMER BOUNDARIES OF 1967, ""WHICH SERVED AS TEMPTATION TO AGGRESSION"", BUT CONFIDENTIAL ISRAEL IS READY FOR CONCESSIONS WHICH DO NOT COMPROMISE SECURITY. OVERRIDING THEME OF PEACE CONFERENCE FOR ISRAEL, EBAN SAID, WILL BE SECURITY. ATTAINMENT OF PEACE WILL MAKE POSSIBLE SOLUTION OF REFUGEE PROBLEM THROUGH REGIONAL COOPERATION. ARAB REFUGEE PROBLEM NOT BASICALLY INTRACTABLE AND AT APPROPRIATE STAGE ISRAEL WILL DEFINE ITS CONTRIBUTION TO REFUGEE SOLUTION. EBAN SAID ISRAEL IS OPPOSED TO ""ANY EXPLOSIVE FRAGMENTATION"" OF AREAS BETWEEN MEDITERRANEAN AND DESERT. IN THIS REGION, HE SAID, THERE IS ROOM FOR ONLY TWO STATES, NOT THREE. RE JERUSALEM, EBAN SAID ISRAEL IS DEEPLY AWARE IT IS CRADLE OF TWO OTHER GREAT RELIGIONS AND DOES NOT WANT TO EXERCISE AUTHORITY OVER HOLY PLACES OF ISLAM AND CHRISTIANITY.\n2. EBAN SAID DISENGAGEMENT OF FORCES WAS LOGICAL FIRST TOPIC FOR CONFERENCE TO TAKE UP. HE SAID ABSENCE OF SYRIANS WAS REGRETTABLE, BUT COULD NOT SAY THAT SYRIA COULD QUALIFY FOR PEACE CONFERENCE AS LONG AS IT CONTINUED IN VIOLATION OF BASIC HUMAN DECENCIES. EBAN SAID 42 ISRAELI PRISONERS OF WAR HAD BEEN MURDERED IN COLD BLOOD BY SYRIANS. SAID OBLIGATIONS UNDER 3RD GENEVA CONVENTION WERE UNCONDITIONAL. IN SPITE OF ITS OUTRAGE AT THESE CRIMES, ISRAEL HAD NEVERTHELESS OFFERED SYRIANS EXCHANGE OF POWS, RETURN OF CIVILIANS TO TERRITORY OCCUPIED IN OCTOBER WAR, AND HANDING OVER TO UNEF OF TWO SYRIAN POSITIONS CAPTURED BY ISRAEL BETWEEN OCTOBER 22-24.\n3. EBAN EXPRESSED HOPE THAT IN NEXT STATE CONFERENCE WOULD ADOPT COMPACT, EFFECTIVE PROCEDURES THAT WOULD ENABLE BUSINESS-LIKE PROGRESS TO BE MADE. ISRAEL DID NOT RULE OUT POSSIBILITY OF AGREED, PHASED APPROACH TO PEACE SETTLEMENT BUT SAID CONFERENCE SHOULD NOT BE SATISFIED BY ANYTHING LESS THAN REAL PEACE AS ITS ULTIMATE OBJECTIVE. EBAN SAID ISRAEL ACCEPTED US AND SOVIET AUSPICES AS REALISTIC REFLECTION OF POWER STRUCTURE IN AREA. SAID HE UNDERSTOOD FROM GROMYKOS SPEECH THAT SOVIETS ACCEPTED ISRAELS EXISTENCE, BUT SAID LANGUAGE EMANATING FROM ALGERIAN SUMMIT MADE HIM LESS CERTAIN THAT ARABS HAD MADE SIMILAR COMMITMENT. EBAN CLOSED BY CALLING ON CONFERENCE TO PROVIDE MAXIMUM OPPORTUNITY FOR PARTIES THEMSELVES TO ENGAGE IN DIALOGUE SO THAT THEY COULD REACH ACCORD ON ISSUED DIVIDING THEM. CONFIDENTIAL 24.

gamesmanship frustration and genuine concern Despite his bombast he wants                        a peaceful settlement and has staked his reputation on it Same time he is                        acutely conscious that radical Arab critics are charging Egypt with having                        become soft With competing Arab centers of power such as Algeria Syria                        and moneyrich Saudi Arabia to contend with Egypts objective of retaining                        preeminence in the Arab world can only be retained by continuing to lead                        the pack Syria shows signs of kicking traces and Assads unexpected trip to                        Qadhaafi worries Egyptians To keep others in line Fahmy realizes Egypt                        desperately needs something tangible to point to to justify its current more                        moderate line2 Failure to achieve initial phase disengagement through USsponsored six                        point agreement has come as a blow to Fahmy and his government Rightly or                        wrongly Sadat had expected some                        initial Israeli disengagement prior to the peace conference and that USG would press a reluctant Israel to do so                        Before recent African and Arab forums GOE                        representatives from Sadat down                        boldly gave justificatory assurances that this would happen They must now                        eat crow and attribute awkward position in which they placed themselves to                            USG unwillingness fulfill what they                        conceived as obligation They are fearful they will be fed a bone and lose                        face at home and abroad3 Fahmys warning that unless substantial disengagement is agreed upon and                        finalized at first session of peace talks should not be entirely discounted                        For the sake of form in Arab world and at home Egyptian leadership may find                        it has to do just that Yet Fahmy is still desperately hoping that something                        will come out of first phase talks that GOE                        can use to continue to justify the policy he and Sadat have devised Though rejecting                        adequacy of initial phase disengagement for this purpose it will be noted                        that he significantly threw out thought that either large or medium scale                        disengagement must emerge from the first phase of the conference para 7                            reftel To my knowledge this is                        the first time Fahmy has used the term medium scale disengagement Heretofore his dichotomy has been                        larger and first or initial stage4 Conceivably a facesaving formula may be found by casting whatever                        disengagement proves to be negotiable at upcoming Geneva talks by focusing                        on medium stage disengagement whatever that may be and trying finesse so                        called first or initial phase Fahmy did not define what he meant by                        medium stage disengagement but given his earlier concern about broader                            UNEFmanned belt somewhere around                        Mitla Pass area something along these lines if Israelis will buy it might                        just do the trick5 Fahmy and other senior Egyptians are currently highly sensitive to any                        suggestion Israeli elections should govern pace of negotiations They need                        be discreetly reminded of this salient fact whether they like it or not                        though conceivably time factor could also be finessed by all parties quietly                        agreeing that Christmas Muslim Bairam holidays January 34 and Coptic                        Christmas January 7 offer at least a plausible reason to defer second                        phase of conference until midJanuary We hear from press sources that at                        least some responsible Egyptians are acknowledging that despite current                        high level of tension which GOEinspired                        press is maintaining no change in Egyptian policy likely to be made until                        January 15 or after This may or may not be so6 Meanwhile as previously reported Fahmy remains deeply worried about his                        personal position He believes that his contacts with the army are good but                        seems worried about possible adverse university student reactions He is                        also mindful of his many critics and rivals in Peoples Assembly press and                        elsewhere at home and in radical Arab world and has sometimes spoken of his                        at least five rivals for his job At the moment he still seems to have                            Sadats confidence but the                        President is mercurial and could easily make him a scapegoat The image of                        an omnipresent bitter Mahmoud Riad                        who as Arab League SYG still gives frequent                        vent to how USG let him down is indelible                        in Fahmys mind He is afraid that the pace we envisage may be too slow to                        keep Sadat Arab and public opinion                        in line and him in office Result is he is likely to continue to play it                            toughIn telegram Secto 173214 to Cairo December 10                                Kissinger responded to                                Eilts

JORDANIAN AMBASSADOR ABDUL MUNIM RIFAI CAME TO SEE ME THIS MORNING.  HE FIRST RECOUNTED ROCKY ROAD OF RECENT EGYPTIAN/JORDANIAN RELATIONS, INCLUDING SADATS DISPLEASURE WITH HUSSEIN DURING LAST DAYS OF OCTOBER HOSTILITIES FOR FAILING TO MEET FORMERS ""DEMANDS"" (UNSPECIFIED).  HE THEN ADDRESSED CURRENT STATE OF PLAY BETWEEN THE TWO COUNTRIES WITH PARTICULAR REFERENCE TO UPCOMING PEACE CONFERENCE AND TO PLO PARTICIPATION.\n2.  EGYPTS PERFORMANCE DURING ARAB SUMMIT IN PRESSING FOR SEPARATE PLO ROLE HAD BEEN DISAPPOINTING TO JORDAN. RIFAI HAD BEEN IN AMMAN SINCE THAT TIME AND FOUND HUSSEIN ADAMANT ON REFUSING TO PARTICIPATE IN CONFERENCE IF ARAB STATES INSIST ON SEPARATE PLO REPRESENTATION.  ACCORDINGLY, HE HAD BEEN SENT BACK TO CAIRO TO MAKE CLEAR JORDANIAN POSITION.  SHORTLY AFTER ARRIVING THREE DAYS AGO, HE SAW FAHMY AND STRESSED JORDAN WOULD NOT FEEL ITSELF ABLE TO ATTEND UNLESS EGYPT AND OTHER ARAB STATES CLEARLY DEFINE ITS RIGHTS AND RESPONSIBILITIES ON WEST BANK.  JORDAN HAS RESPONSIBILITY, HE STRESSED, FOR RECOVERY WEST BANK    SECRET  TERRITORIES AND PALESTINIAN REFUGEES NOT ONLY IN JORDAN BUT ELSEWHERE AS WELL.  JORDAN WAS UNCLEAR WHETHER EGYPT WISHED IT TO ATTEND GENEVA TALKS.  WHEN FAHMY COUNTERED THAT JORDAN INCLUDED AMONG ARAB STATES LISTED IN DRAFT LETTER TO SYG AND THAT THIS SHOULD CONSTITUTE EGYPTIAN ENDORSEMENT OF JORDANIAN ATTENDANCE, RIFAI RESPONDED THIS WOULD REPRESENT INVITATION FROM THE TWO POWERS BUT WAS INADEQUATE TO DEMONSTRATE EGYPTIAN CONCURRENCE.  HE ASKED FOR A PUBLIC EGYPTIAN STATEMENT SAYING IT EXPECTED JORDAN TO ATTEND AND REPRESENT WEST BANK AND PALESTINIANS WHILE THERE.  FAHMY ALLEGEDLY CALLED IN AHRAM CORRESPONDENT IN HIS OUTER OFFICE AND DICTATED SHORT STATEMENT TO THE EFFECT WHICH, WHILE SOMEWHAT ANODYNED, RIFAI WAS PREPARED TO ACCEPT.  ALTHOUGH FAHMY INSTRUCTED AHRAM REPORT THIS PUBLIC STATEMENT FOLLOWING DAY, IT HAS NOT YET APPEARED.  HE HAS HAD NO EXPLANATION FROM FAHMY, HENCE EGYPTS POSITION REMAINS UNCLEAR.\n3.  RIFAI IS SCHEDULED TO SEE SADAT TODAY.  AT THAT MEETING HE INTENDS TO REITERATE JORDANIAN POSITION AS HE HAS GIVEN IT TO FAHMY AND OFFER SEVERAL ALTERNATIVES FOR EGYPT TO SHOW ITS DESIRE HAVE JORDAN THERE ON A BASIS ACCEPTABLE TO HUSSEIN:  (A) A PUBLIC GOE STATEMENT SIMILAR TO THAT WHICH FAHMY DICTATED BUT WHICH NEVER APPEARED, (B) A MEETING BETWEEN HUSSEIN AND SADAT IN CAIRO PRIOR TO GENEVA TALKS IN ORDER TO DEMONSTRATE EGYPTIAN SUPPORT OF JORDANIAN POSITION, (C) FAILING THIS, A MEETING BETWEEN REPRESENTATIVES OF THE TWO GOVERNMENTS AT A MINISTERIAL LEVEL TO WORK OUT SOMETHING SATISFACTORY.  IF EGYPTIANS REFUSE ANY OF THESE ALTER- NATIVES, RIFAI WAS PESSIMISTIC THAT HUSSEIN WILL BE WILLING TO ATTEND.  THIS, HE CONTENDED, WOULD BE BAD FOR PEACE CONFERENCE.\n4.  RIFAI ALSO CLAIMED TO HAVE BEEN IN TOUCH WITH PLO REPRESENTATIVES IN CAIRO TWO EVENINGS AGO.  HE HAD POINTED OUT TO THEM HUSSEINS POSITION THAT JORDAN SHOULD IN FIRST INSTANCE REPRESENT ALL PALESTINIANS.  AT A LATER STAGE PALESTINIAN REPRESENTATIVES MIGHT JOIN TALKS.  HOW THIS MIGHT BE DONE SHOULD BE DISCUSSED AT CONFERENCE.  HE CLAIMED PLO REPRESENTATIVES NOT ADVERSE TO HIS IDEAS, SINCE DEEP DIVISIONS EXIST AMONG THEM AS TO WHETHER AND HOW THEY SHOULD PARTICIPATE IN GENEVA TALKS.    SECRET  5.  RIFAI ASKED IF FORMAL INVITATIONS HAVE YET BEEN SENT. I TOLD HIM THAT I WAS SURE US REPRESENTATIVE IN AMMAN DISCUSSING MATTER WITH JORDANIANS BUT IT WAS MY UNDERSTANDING MODALITIES STILL BEING WORKED OUT.  HE COMMENTED THAT IT WAS NOT MERELY A MATTER OF MODALITIES, BUT ALSO FORM WHICH ANY INVITATION TO JORDAN TAKES THAT WILL MATTER WITH HUSSEIN.  HE PERSONALLY BELIEVES JORDAN SHOULD PARTICIPATE, BUT HE HAD TO ACKNOWLEDGE KINGS VIEWS WERE VALID AND HAD FORCEFULLY SOUGHT TO PRESENT THEM HERE.  HE NOTED HUSSEINS STRONG SENSE OF PRIDE, AND OBSERVED MUCH WILL ALSO DEPEND ON RESULTS SECRETARYS VISIT TO AMMAN.\n6.  RIFAI IS SCHEDULED RETURN TO AMMAN TOMORROW.  IF JORDAN PARTICIPATES IN GENEVA TALKS, HE THOUGHT HE MIGHT WELL BE THE JORDANIAN REPRESENTATIVE.\n7.  IN SEPARATE CONVERSATION WITH USINTOFF, JORDANIAN POLITICAL COUNSELOR ALSO MADE POINT THAT KING BELIEVES IT LIKELY THAT A WAY COULD BE FOUND AT GENEVA TO HAVE PALES- TINIANS JOIN TALKS AFTER OPENING SESSIONS.  HE STRESSED THAT HUSSEIN IS DETERMINED THAT JORDAN SHOULD BE REPRESENTED AND IS UNDERTAKING A BROAD DIPLOMATIC CAMPAIGN TO INSURE THAT IT IS.

gamesmanship frustration and genuine concern Despite his bombast he wants                        a peaceful settlement and has staked his reputation on it Same time he is                        acutely conscious that radical Arab critics are charging Egypt with having                        become soft With competing Arab centers of power such as Algeria Syria                        and moneyrich Saudi Arabia to contend with Egypts objective of retaining                        preeminence in the Arab world can only be retained by continuing to lead                        the pack Syria shows signs of kicking traces and Assads unexpected trip to                        Qadhaafi worries Egyptians To keep others in line Fahmy realizes Egypt                        desperately needs something tangible to point to to justify its current more                        moderate line2 Failure to achieve initial phase disengagement through USsponsored six                        point agreement has come as a blow to Fahmy and his government Rightly or                        wrongly Sadat had expected some                        initial Israeli disengagement prior to the peace conference and that USG would press a reluctant Israel to do so                        Before recent African and Arab forums GOE                        representatives from Sadat down                        boldly gave justificatory assurances that this would happen They must now                        eat crow and attribute awkward position in which they placed themselves to                            USG unwillingness fulfill what they                        conceived as obligation They are fearful they will be fed a bone and lose                        face at home and abroad3 Fahmys warning that unless substantial disengagement is agreed upon and                        finalized at first session of peace talks should not be entirely discounted                        For the sake of form in Arab world and at home Egyptian leadership may find                        it has to do just that Yet Fahmy is still desperately hoping that something                        will come out of first phase talks that GOE                        can use to continue to justify the policy he and Sadat have devised Though rejecting                        adequacy of initial phase disengagement for this purpose it will be noted                        that he significantly threw out thought that either large or medium scale                        disengagement must emerge from the first phase of the conference para 7                            reftel To my knowledge this is                        the first time Fahmy has used the term medium scale disengagement Heretofore his dichotomy has been                        larger and first or initial stage4 Conceivably a facesaving formula may be found by casting whatever                        disengagement proves to be negotiable at upcoming Geneva talks by focusing                        on medium stage disengagement whatever that may be and trying finesse so                        called first or initial phase Fahmy did not define what he meant by                        medium stage disengagement but given his earlier concern about broader                            UNEFmanned belt somewhere around                        Mitla Pass

suggestion Israeli elections should govern pace of negotiations They need                        be discreetly reminded of this salient fact whether they like it or not                        though

49,0.7063567700795708,3876 Subject: Middle East Negotiations Ref: Cairo 3870See footnote 6 Document 3801 Fahmys extraordinary performance last night was a mixture of                        gamesmanship frustration and genuine concern Despite his bombast he wants                        a peaceful settlement and has staked his reputation on it Same time he is                        acutely conscious that radical Arab critics are charging Egypt with having                        become soft With competing Arab centers of power such as Algeria Syria                        and moneyrich Saudi Arabia to contend with Egypts objective of retaining                        preeminence in the Arab world can only be retained by continuing to lead                        the pack Syria shows signs of kicking traces and Assads unexpected trip to                        Qadhaafi worries Egyptians To keep others in line Fahmy realizes Egypt                        desperately needs something tangible to point to to justify its current more                        moderate line2 Failure to achieve initial phase disengagement through USsponsored six                        point agreement has come as a blow to Fahmy and his government Rightly or                        wrongly Sadat had expected some                        initial Israeli disengagement prior to the peace conference and that USG would press a reluctant Israel to do so                        Before recent African and Arab forums GOE                        representatives from Sadat down                        boldly gave justificatory assurances that this would happen They must now                        eat crow and attribute awkward position in which they placed themselves to                            USG unwillingness fulfill what they                        conceived as obligation They are fearful they will be fed a bone and lose                        face at home and abroad3 Fahmys warning that unless substantial disengagement is agreed upon and                        finalized at first session of peace talks should not be entirely discounted                        For the sake of form in Arab world and at home Egyptian leadership may find                        it has to do just that Yet Fahmy is still desperately hoping that something                        will come out of first phase talks that GOE                        can use to continue to justify the policy he and Sadat have devised Though rejecting                        adequacy of initial phase disengagement for this purpose it will be noted                        that he significantly threw out thought that either large or medium scale                        disengagement must emerge from the first phase of the conference para 7                            reftel To my knowledge this is                        the first time Fahmy has used the term medium scale disengagement Heretofore his dichotomy has been                        larger and first or initial stage4 Conceivably a facesaving formula may be found by casting whatever                        disengagement proves to be negotiable at upcoming Geneva talks by focusing                        on medium stage disengagement whatever that may be and trying finesse so                        called first or initial phase Fahmy did not define what he meant by                        medium stage disengagement but given his earlier concern about broader                            UNEFmanned belt somewhere around                        Mitla Pass area something along these lines if Israelis will buy it might                        just do the trick5 Fahmy and other senior Egyptians are currently highly sensitive to any                        suggestion Israeli elections should govern pace of negotiations They need                        be discreetly reminded of this salient fact whether they like it or not                        though conceivably time factor could also be finessed by all parties quietly                        agreeing that Christmas Muslim Bairam holidays January 34 and Coptic                        Christmas January 7 offer at least a plausible reason to defer second                        phase of conference until midJanuary We hear from press sources that at                        least some responsible Egyptians are acknowledging that despite current                        high level of tension which GOEinspired                        press is maintaining no change in Egyptian policy likely to be made until                        January 15 or after This may or may not be so6 Meanwhile as previously reported Fahmy remains deeply worried about his                        personal position He believes that his contacts with the army are good but                        seems worried about possible adverse university student reactions He is                        also mindful of his many critics and rivals in Peoples Assembly press and                        elsewhere at home and in radical Arab world and has sometimes spoken of his                        at least five rivals for his job At the moment he still seems to have                            Sadats confidence but the                        President is mercurial and could easily make him a scapegoat The image of                        an omnipresent bitter Mahmoud Riad                        who as Arab League SYG still gives frequent                        vent to how USG let him down is indelible                        in Fahmys mind He is afraid that the pace we envisage may be too slow to                        keep Sadat Arab and public opinion                        in line and him in office Result is he is likely to continue to play it                            toughIn telegram Secto 173214 to Cairo December 10                                Kissinger responded to                                Eilts

Fahmy Vinogradov called                        to say he had prepared a revised draft letter to SYG based on principles enunciated by Fahmy and wanted us to                        submit it to our governments as a joint draft He would send over Soviet                        Embassy officer with text I reminded Vinogradov that Fahmy had specifically stated he had a                        series of principles in mind and that language based on these principles                        could be worked out by our governments While I could not therefore endorse                        any specific text I was willing to review his draft to ascertain whether it                        was consistent with my understanding of Fahmys principles2 Vinogradovs draft revision reads                        as follows:Dear Mr Secretary General:On October 22 1973 the Security Council adopted Resolution 338 and                            339In telegram 3939 from Cairo December                            12 Eilts reported that                            Vinogradov had just telephoned to say that he had shown his new draft to                                Fahmi and asked if it                            accurately incorporated his principles to which the Foreign Minister                            replied that it did Vinogradov said that he had emphasized that this                            was his own personal attempt to formulate acceptable language and was                            not official He also had asked Fahmi about inclusion of a reference to UN Security Council Resolution 339 which                            had not been in any of the earlier drafts The Foreign Minister said                            someone had told him to include it but he could not remember who He                            then agreed that there was no need to include a reference to the                            resolution in the draft letter Ibid jointly sponsored by the                        Soviet Union and the United States which calls for negotiations to start                        between the parties concerned under appropriate auspices aimed at                        establishing a just and durable peace in the Middle East The Soviet Union                        and the United States have now been informed by the parties concerned of                        their readiness to participate in the peace conference The conference                        should be convened under the auspices of the United NationsIt is our understanding that Egypt Israel Jordan and Syria have agreed to                        participate from the outset in the conference which would begin in Geneva on                        December 18 The parties have agreed that the conference should be under the                        cochairmanship of the Soviet Union and the United States The parties have                        also agreed that the question of the participation of the Palestinians and                        Lebanon will be discussed during the first stage of the conferenceIt is our hope that you will find it possible to participate in the opening                        phase of the conference at which it is expected that the governments                        concerned will be represented by their respective Foreign Ministers and                        later by their specially appointed representatives with Ambassadorial rank                        We also hope that you can make available a representative who would keep you                        fully informed as the conference proceeds Finally we would also appreciate                        it if the United Nations could make appropriate arrangements for the                        necessary conference facilitiesIf as we hope you find it possible to participate as cochairmen the Soviet                        Union and the US would appreciate it if you would agree to serve as                        convener of the conference and preside in the opening phaseWe request that you circulate this letter to members of the Security Council                        for their information We believe it would be appropriate for the President                        of the Security Council to consult informally with the membership with a                        view to securing a favorable consensus of the Council3 I sent word to Vinogradov that I would submit his text to the Secretary                        and Washington as he had requested with an indication that it is                        consistent with my understanding of Fahmys principles I could not however endorse any particular text                        since my government would have to make final determinationIn telegram Hakto

                    him that the United States was seeking immediate approval from Israel                            He should also give Dinitz the                            text as soon as possible stressing several points First the letter                            did not state that the conference would be under UN auspices but rather that it would be                            convened under UN auspices There                            would be no substantive role for the Secretary General Second the                            Security Council would be consulted informally Third the United States                            had successfully fought to delete the phrase on the timing of                            Palestinian participation This formulation was neutral and left the                            matter open Finally he should urge Israel not to make the                            SyrianIsraeli POW issue a precondition                            of its participation in

Eilts reported that                            Vinogradov had just telephoned to say that he had shown his new draft to                                Fahmi and asked if it                            accurately incorporated his principles to which the Foreign Minister                            replied that it did Vinogradov said that he had emphasized that this                            was his own personal attempt to formulate acceptable language and was                            not official He also had asked Fahmi about inclusion of a reference to UN Security Council Resolution 339 which                            had not been in any of the earlier drafts The Foreign Minister said                            someone had told him to include it but he could not remember who He                            then agreed that there was no need to include a reference to the                            resolution in the draft letter Ibid jointly sponsored by the                        Soviet

and durable peace in the Middle East The Soviet Union                        and the United States have now been informed by the parties concerned of                        their readiness to participate in the peace conference The conference                        should be convened under the auspices of the United NationsIt is our understanding that Egypt Israel Jordan and Syria have agreed to                        participate from the outset in the conference which would begin in Geneva on                        December 18 The parties have agreed that the conference should be under the                        cochairmanship of the Soviet Union and the United States The parties have                        also agreed that the question of the participation of the Palestinians and                        Lebanon will be discussed during the first stage of the conferenceIt is our hope that you will find it possible to participate in the opening                        phase of the conference at which it is expected that the governments                        concerned will be represented by their respective Foreign Ministers and                        later by their specially appointed representatives with Ambassadorial rank                        We also hope that you can make available a representative who would keep you                        fully informed as the conference proceeds Finally we would also appreciate                        it if the United Nations could make appropriate arrangements for the                        necessary conference

convener of the conference and preside in the opening phaseWe request that you circulate this letter to members of the Security Council                        for their information We believe it would be appropriate for the President                        of the Security Council to consult informally with the membership with a                        view to securing a favorable consensus of the Council3 I sent word to Vinogradov that I would submit his text to the Secretary                        and Washington as he had requested with an indication that it is

stressing several points First the letter                            did not state that the conference would be under UN auspices but rather that it would be                            convened under UN auspices There                            would be no substantive role for the Secretary General Second the                            Security Council would be consulted informally Third the United States                            had successfully fought to delete the phrase on the timing of                            Palestinian participation This formulation was neutral and left the                            matter open Finally he should urge Israel not to make the                            SyrianIsraeli POW issue a precondition                            of its participation in

specially appointed representatives with Ambassadorial rank                        We also hope that you can make available a representative who would keep you                        fully informed as the conference proceeds Finally we would also appreciate                        it if the United Nations could make appropriate arrangements for the                        necessary conference

convener of the conference and preside in the opening phaseWe request that you circulate this letter to members of the Security Council                        for their information We believe it would be appropriate for the President                        of the Security Council to consult informally with the membership with a                        view to securing a favorable consensus of the Council3 I sent word to Vinogradov that I would submit his text to the Secretary                        and Washington as he had requested with an indication that it is

stressing several points First the letter                            did not state that the conference would be under UN auspices but rather that it would be                            convened under

SECURITY COUNCIL CONSULTATIONS ON DRAFT CONSENSUS OR RESOLUTION CONTINUED MORNING DEC 13. PRC AND FRANCE ABSENT. PRESENT TEXT TRANSMITTED AT END THIS MESSAGE. DISCUSSION OF TEXT WAS UNEVENTFUL AND ELIMINATED UNDESIRABLE LANGUAGE INCLUDED AT END OF ORIGINAL OPERATIVE PARA 3 (NOW 4) ""AND TO DECIDE IF ANY CHANGE IN THE NATURE AND SCOPE OF UN PARTICIPATION AT THE PEACE CONFERENCE IS CALLED FOR"".\n2. WHEN INDIAN PERMREP SEN WISHED TO MOVE ON TO DIS- CUSSION OF FORM OF TEXT (CONSENSUS OR RESOLUTION) AND KIND OF MEETING WHICH MIGHT BE HELD, AMB SCHAUFELE STATED THAT WHILE US AWARE AND SYMPATHETIC TO MEMBERS INTEREST IN SC ACTION AS SOON AS POSSIBLE, US COULD NOT AGREE TO TEXT. RATHER HE SAID ANY TEXT WORKED OUT BY SC SHOULD BE BASED ON LETTER WHICH HAS NOT YET ARRIVED. HE EMPHASIZED THAT WORDS OF AMB SEN ""DIFFICULT AND DELICATE NEGOTIATIONS"" ARE SUFFICIENT ARGUMENT FOR SC NOT TO MOVE PRECIPITATELY ON THIS MATTER. FACT THAT AGREED    SECRET\n3. US POSITION SUPPORTED BY USSR AND UK. OTHERS ACCEDED MORE OR LESS GRACEFULLY, ASKING HOW LONG THEY WOULD HAVE TO WAIT. IT WAS RHETORICALLY ASKED HOW PRESENT TEXT COULD HAVE HARMFUL EFFECT ON LETTER OR CONFERENCE. SCHAUFELE POINTED OUT THAT IT HAD ALWAYS BEEN THE INTENTION OF THE US TO INVOLVE SC IN THIS MATTER AND THAT IF WE ASKING FOR FURTHER PATIENCE NOW IT WAS BECAUSE ALL MEMBERS SC SHARED OUR PRIMARY CONCERN THAT NOTHING BE DONE WHICH COULD ENDANGER OR UPSET NEGOTIATION PROCESS. IN 25 YEARS MIDDLE EAST PROBLEM HAS NOT BEEN SOLVED EITHER IN OR OUT OF UN AND CHANCES WE NOW HAVE TO SUCCEED WOULD NOT BE ENDANGERED BY A FURTHER DELAY.\n4. WHILE MOST MEMBERS WERE UNDERSTANDING, YUGOSLAV PERMREP MOJSOV LAUNCHED INTO PERORATION SAYING THAT WE SHOULD BE FRANK TO SAY ONE PARTY, ISRAEL, WAS HOLDING UP NEGOTIATIONS AND THAT SC SHOULD FIX A DEADLINE FOR ACTING ON THIS MATTER. PROPOSED THAT SC ACT ON DRAFT, DELETING OP PARA 1, IF LETTER NOT RECEIVED BY SUCH DEADLING. SAID SC SC SHOULD NOT SUBMIT TO ISRAELI THREATS TO DISRUPT SC OR PEACE CONFERENCE. FURTHERMORE SC SHOULD NOT AGAIN BE PUT IN POSITION OF HAVING TO ACT AS ""RUBBER-STAMP"" OR AT LAST MINUTE. SCHAUFELE POINTED OUT THAT IN TWO DRAFTING SESSIONS SC MEMBERS HAD AMPLY AND VALUABLE OPPORTUNITY TO EXCHANGE VIEWS SO THAT FINAL TEXT SHOULD NOT BE DIFFICULT TO ACHIEVE. TO CONTENTION THAT SYG PLANS DEPART FOR GENEVA DEC 15 HE SAID HE COULD NOT CONCEIVE OF SYG DEPARTURE BEFORE RECEIPT OF LETTER. (THIS CONFIRMED BY ASYG URQUHART LATER.) GENERAL VIEW WAS THAT SC SHOULD BE PREPARED TO MEET IN SOME FASHION AFTERNOON DEC 14.\n5. MOVING ON TO QUESTIONS OF FORM OF TEXT AND OPTIONS FOR HANDLING THIS MATTER, MOST COUNCIL MEMBERS BELIEVED THAT THERE SHOULD BE A RESOLUTION ALTHOUGH US, UK AND USSR OPPOSED THIS CONCEPT AND SAID THEY PREFER CONSENSUS. HOWEVER, AT END OF DISCUSSION THERE WAS NO CLEAR VIEW AND WE BELIEVE THAT CONSENSUS OR AT LEAST ADOPTION OF RESOLUTION    SECRET\n6. VIEWS ON HAVING A MEETING WERE MORE FIRM AND PREVAILING SENTIMENT IS FOR FORMAL MEETING, WHICH OPPOSED BY US AND USSR. SEVERAL POSSIBILITIES WERE RAISED: (1) CLOSED MEETING; (2) OPEN MEETING ON AGENDA ITEM OTHER THAN ""SITUATION IN ME"" TO PRECLUDE REQUEST FOR PARTICIPATION OF NON-MEMBERS; (3) VARIANT OF 2 ABOVE WITH AGREEMENT THAT SHOULD SUCH REQUESTS BE MADE VEN ON NEW ITEM, SC MEMBERS WOULD NOT PERMIT NON-MEMBERS TO SPEAK; (4) OPEN MEETING AND AGREEMENT ON TEXT FOLLOWED BY STATEMENTS.\n7. AS THIS DISCUSSION WENT ON, IDEA WAS GRADUALLY EMERGING THAT THERE BE OPEN MEETING WITH NO STATEMENTS AND NO PARTICIPATION BY NON-MEMBERS. ALL CONCURRED THAT DEBATE ON SUBSTANCE SHOULD BE AVOIDED. MAJOR UNKNOWN IS ATTITUDE OF CHINA WHICH WILL NOT PARTICIPATE AND MAY BELIEVE THAT IT HAS TO MAKE A STATEMENT.  SOVIET REP THEN SAID THAT HE WOULD HAVE TO RESERVE SOVIET POSITION ON WHETHER IT COULD REMAIN SILENT.\n8. ALL OF ABOVE WILL BE CONVEYED TO PRES OF SC BY GUINEA PERMREP BUT WE BELIEVE THAT WE AND PERHAPS OTHERS WILL HAVE TO TALK TO HUANG HUA ABOUT THIS.\n9. FOLLOWING MEETING BRITISH AND AUSTRIANS, WHO, ALONG WITH SOME OTHERS, FIRMLY SUPPORT IDEA THAT THERE BE NO DEBATE AND NO SPEECHES, SUGGESTZD THAT A CLOSED FORMAL MEETING WOULD BE PREFERABLE. HOWEVER THEY HAD FAILED TO ARGUE FOR THIS IN THE MEETING.\n0. ALSO AFTER MEETING, IN DICUSSION WITH SOVIETS QUESTION WAS RAISED WHETHER CHINA AS SC PRESIDENT WOULD BE CONTENT TO MAKE OPENING STATEMENT PRESENTING THE TEXT AND AT SAME TIME DISASSOCIATING PRC FROM MATTER. WE QUESTION WHETHER THIS WOULD BE ACCEPTABLE TO CHINESE.\n1. TEXT OF DRAFT RESOLUTION OR CONSENSUS:\n1.

contained the                            account of Eiltss meeting with                                Fahmi and Vinogradov Ibid1 Following my return to USINT after                        meeting with Fahmy Vinogradov called                        to say he had prepared a revised draft letter to SYG based on principles enunciated by Fahmy and wanted us to                        submit it to our governments as a joint draft He would send over Soviet                        Embassy officer with text I reminded Vinogradov that Fahmy had specifically stated he had a                        series of principles in mind and that language based on these principles                        could be worked out by our governments While I could not therefore endorse                        any specific text I was willing to review his draft to ascertain whether it                        was consistent with my understanding of Fahmys principles2 Vinogradovs draft revision reads                        as follows:Dear Mr Secretary General:On October 22 1973 the Security Council adopted Resolution 338 and                            339In telegram 3939 from Cairo December                            12 Eilts reported that                            Vinogradov had just telephoned to say that he had shown his new draft to                                Fahmi and asked if it                            accurately incorporated his principles to which the Foreign Minister                            replied that it did Vinogradov said that he had emphasized that this                            was his own personal attempt to formulate acceptable language and was                            not official He also had asked Fahmi about inclusion of a reference to UN Security Council Resolution 339 which                            had not been in any of the earlier drafts The Foreign Minister said                            someone had told him to include it but he could not remember who He                            then agreed that there was no need to include a reference to the                            resolution in the draft letter Ibid jointly sponsored by the                        Soviet Union and the United States which calls for negotiations to start                        between the parties concerned under appropriate auspices aimed at                        establishing a just and durable peace in the Middle East The Soviet Union                        and the United States have now been informed by the parties concerned of                        their readiness to participate in the peace conference The conference                        should be convened under the auspices of the United NationsIt is our understanding that Egypt Israel Jordan and Syria have agreed to                        participate from the outset in the conference which would begin in Geneva on                        December 18 The parties have agreed that the conference should be under the                        cochairmanship of the Soviet Union and the United States The parties have                        also agreed that the question of the participation of the Palestinians and                        Lebanon will be discussed during the first stage of the conferenceIt is our hope that you will find it possible to participate in the opening                        phase of

GENEVA PEACE CONFERENCE OPENED WITH NO SURPRISES AT\n2. MORNING SESSION WAS DEVOTED ENTIRELY TO STATEMENTS BY WALDHEIM AND ALL FOREIGN MINISTERS EXCEPT EBAN, WHO SPOKE AT\n3. WALKEIMS OPENING STATEMENT WAS BRIEF AND BLAND. GROMYKO, WHO SPOKE NEXT, GAVE RELATIVELY SHORT AND RESTRAINED SPEECH, STATING STANDARD SOVIET CRITICISM OF ISRAEL AND SUPPORT FOR ARAB NEGOTIATING POSITIONS BUT INCLUDING MORE THAN USUAL EMPHASIS ON NEED TO ACCEPT ISRAELI SOVEREIGNTY AND RIGHT TO NATIONAL EXISTENCE. GROMYKO WAS FOLLOWED BY SECRETARY KISSINGER (FULL TEXT BY SEPTEL).\n4. ORIGINAL PLAN HAD BEEN FOR EGYPTIAN, JORDANIAN AND ISRAELI FOREIGN MINISTERS TO SPEAK AT SECOND OPEN SESSION SATURDAY MORNING, WITH FRIDAY AFTERNOON FREE FOR BILATERAL CONSULTATIONS. EGYPTIAN FOREIGN MINISTER FAHMY, HOWEVER, INSISTED ON SPEAKING FIRST DAY, AND AS CONSEQUENCE SO DID JORDANIAN AND ISRAELI.\n5. FAHMYS SPEECH, WHILE REAFFIRMING ALL STANDARD EGYPTIAN POSITIONS IN UNCOMPROMISING LANGUE, HAD MINIMUM OF RHETORIC AND REITERATED FREQUENTLY THAT EGYPTIAN OBJECTIVE IS PEACEFUL SETTLEMENT  RECOGNIZING SOVEREIGNTY OF ALL STATES IN AREA. JORDANIAN PRIME MINISTER AND FOREIGN MINISTER ZAID RIFAI, OBVIOUSLY WITH EYE TO PROTECTING FLANKS IN ARAB WORLD, GAVE CONSIDERABLY MORE HARD-LINE SPEECH THAN FAHMY, WITH EXTENSIVE ATTACKS ON ISRAEL AND MINIMAL EMPHASIS ON NEED FOR PEACEFUL SETTLEMENT.\n6. WHEN CONFERENCE RECONVENED FOR AFTERNOON SESSION, EBAN DELIVERED MODERATE SPEECH WHICH, WHIILE EXPRESSING SKEPTICISM CONFIDENTIAL RE ARAB INTENTIONS, CONSTITUTED ELOQUENT PLEA FOR RECON- CILIATION. IN ONLY EXERCISE OF RIGHT OF REPLY, FAHMY DELIVERED POLEMICAL, INTEMPERATE AND SOMEWHAT RAMBLING COMMENTARY ON EBANS SPEECK,ACCUSING EBAN AMONG OTHER THINGS OF PLAYING TO ISRAELI DOMESTIC OPINION IN ELECTORAL CAMPAIGN, WHILE HIMSELF OBVIOUSLY MAKING POINTS FOR ARAB HOME CONSUMPTION.\n7. BEFORE ADJOURNING AFTERNOON SESSION, WALDHEIM ANNOUNCED THERE WOULD BE CLOSED MEETING AT 11:00 AM SATURDAY, TO REVIEW WORKING PROCEDURES FOR CONFERENCE. GROMYKO INTERJECTED THAT HE ASSUMED QUESTIONS OF SUBSTANCE ALSO COULD BE RAISED, TO WHICH NO OBJECTIONS WERE RAISED.\n8. FOLLOWING ARE SUMMARIES OF SPEECHES AT TODAYS OPENING SESSION.\n9. WALDHEIM IN HIS OPENING REMARKS REMINDED CONFERENCE PARTI- CIPKKTS OF INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITYS CONCERN REGARDING SUCCESS OF THEIR UNDERTAKING AND POINTED OUT THAT SECURITY COUNCIL HAD EXPRESSED HOPE THAT CONFERENCE WOULD MAKE SPEEDY PROGRESS. UN HAS BEEN SEIZED OF MIDDLE EAST CONFLICT FOR PAST\n1. HE EXPRESSED HOPE THAT CONFERENCE WOULD MAKE PROGRESS ON DISENGAGEMENT, AND AT LATER STAGE ON PEACE, AND OFFERED UN ASSISTANCE IN ATTAINING THESE GOALS.\n0. GROMYKO FOLLOWED WITH RELATIVELY SHORT, RESTRAINED SPEECH. STRESSED DANGER THAT ARAB-ISRAELI CONFLICT PRESENTED TO REGIONAL, AS  WELL AS WORLD PEACE IF THE BASIS CAUSES OF DISPUTE WERE NOT RESOLVED. SAID ARABS WOULD NEVER AGREE TO LOSS OF THEIR TERRITORY THAT WAS OCCUPIED IN 1967, AND SOVIETS WLD GIVE THEM SUPPORT\n1. GROMYKO SAID MOST IMPORTANT PRINCIPLE IN APPROACH TO MIDDLE EAST PEACE IS THAT CITED IN S.C. RES. 242, VIZ. CONFIDENTIAL INADMISSIBILITY OF ACQUISITION OF TERRITORY BY WAR. AS LONG AS ISRAELI FORCES REMAINED ON ARAB TERRITORY, THERE WOULD BE NO PEACE. SAID ANY DOCUMENT DRAFTED BY THIS CONF SHOULD BE CLEAR-CUT DECLARATION TO ISRAEL TO VACATE OCCUPIED TERRITORY. WITHOUT THIS, CONF WOULD NOT PRODUCE RESULTS; WITH IT ALL OTHER PROBLEMS, INCLUDING THAT OF PALESTINIANS, COULD BE READILY RESOLVED.\n2. NOTING VERY EXISTENCE OF ISRAEL HAD BEEN BROUGHT ABOUT BY UN RESOLUTION, GROMYKO SAID IT WAS CLEAR THAT ALL STATES HAVE RIGHT TO EXISTENCE, BUT THIS COULD NOT BE ""UNILATERAL RIGHT"" WHICH IGNORED RIGHTS OF OTHERS. RIGHT OF EXISTENCE ENTAILED MUTUAL OBLIGATIONS WITH OTHER STATES. GROMYKO SAID SC RES. 242 STILL REPRESENTED REALISTIC APPROACH TO PEACE SETTLEMENT. CALLED ON CONF TO PRODUCE ""CONCRETE, REALISTIC PROPOSAL"" WHICH WOULD IMPLEMENT RES. 242. HE SAID AGREEMENT REACHED BETWEEN PARTIES SHOULD BE EMBODIED IN CONF DOCUMENTS, WHICH HE SAID SHOULD BE ""WEIGHTY"" DOCUMENTS, HAVING FORCE OF LAW. OBLIGATION THUS ASSUMED UNDER INTERNATIONAL LAW WOULD BE BEST GUARANTEE FOR MUTUAL SECURITY.IF ADDITIONAL GUARANTEES PROVED NECESSARY, USSR TAKING INTO ACCOUNT INTERESTS OF OTHER PARTIES, WOULD BE WILLING TO ACCEPT ADDITIONAL RESPONSIBILITY OF FURTHER GUARANTEES. HE SAID SECURITY COUNCIL WOULD ALSO HAVE ROLE ALONG THESE LINES WHICH COULD BE WORKED OUT IN THE NEGOTIATIONS.\n3. REFERRING AGAIN TO DANGERS OF RENEWED HOSTILITIES, GROMYKO NEVERTHELESS EXPRESSED HOPE CONF COULD PRODUCE RELIABLE PEACE. SAID SOVIET UNION WAS NOT HOSTILE TO ISRAEL PER SE, ONLY TO POLICY OF ANNEXATION. CONCLUDED BY SAYING SOVIET UNION WOULD DO EVERYTHING IN ITS POWER TO MAKE CONF SUCCEED AND SEE IT PROCEED IN CONSTRUCTIVE, EFFECTIVE MANNER.\n4. EGYPTIAN FOREIGN MINISTER FAHMY DELIVERED GENERALLY MODERATE ADDRESS. FAHMY SAID MIDDLE EAST HAS SUFFERED FROM MILITARISTIC AND EXPANSIONIST POLICY OF ISRAEL WHICH HAS SERIOUSLY ENDANGERED INDEPENDENCE AND TERRITORIAL INTEGRITY OF COUNTRIES IN AREA. HOWEVER, HE DID NOT WISH TO DWELL ON THIS. EGYPT HOPED THAT AS RESULT OF OCTOBER WAR ISRAELIS HAD DECIDED TO ""CHANGE THEIR COURSE TOWARDS THE ROAD TO DURABLE AND JUST PEACE"". FAHMY SAID THAT HIS PRESENCE IN GENEVA CONFIDENTIAL SYMBOLIZED EGYPTS DEEP DESIRE TO RESTORE REGION TO DURABLE AND JUST PEACE. ARAB COUNTRIES HAVE COME TO CONFERENCE ""READY AND PREPARED TO LAY THE CORNERSTONE OF THE EDIFICE OF PEACE IN THE MIDDLE EAST."" FAHMY SAID CHANCES OF REPEATING SUCH A HISTORICAL GATHERING WOULD BE REMOTE AND IF CONF DOES NOT SUCCEED, THERE WILL NO DOUBT BE ""RECOURSE TO OTHER MEANS"" BY ARABS TO LIBERATE THEIR LANDS AND TO RESTORE RIGHTS OF PALESTINIANS.\n5. FAHMY SAID HE VIEWED PARTICIPATION OF SOVIET UNION AND UNITED STATES IN COF AS ""A GOOD OMEN"" AND ""EVIDENCE OF THEIR WISH TO GUARANTEE THAT PEACEFUL AND JUST SETTLEMENT WILL PREVAIL IN MIDDLE EAST"". HE THEN LISTED FOLLOWING FIVE BASIC ""ESSENTIALS"" FOR PEACE:\n7.\n6. FAHMY CLOSED WITH STATEMENT THAT EGYPT IS PREPARED TO HONOR OBLIGATIONS EMANATING FROM RESOLUTION 242 AND WITH CALL FOR US AND USSR TO WORK FOR SUCCESS OF CONF.\n7. PRIME MINISTER RIFAI OF JORDAN LED OFF WITH A BRIEF HISTORICAL REVIEW CHARGING ISRAEL WITH MILITARY EXPANSION AND YET FAILING TO GAIN ACCEPTANCE IN WORLD. HE SAID IT WAS CLEAR THAT SC RES 242 ENDORSED RETURN OF ALL ARAB TERRITORIES OCCUPIED IN 1967, INCLUDING SYRIAN TERRITORY, THROUGH (A) ITS CONFIDENTIAL ENDORSEMENT PRINCIPLE OF INADMISSIBILITY OF ACQUISITION OF TERRITORY BY WAR AND (B) ITS CALL FOR ISRAELI WITHDRAWAL FROM THE (SIC) TERRITORIES OCCUPIED IN 1967. HE SAID IN JORDANS VIEW PRINCIPLE OF WITHDRAWAL IS INDIVISIBLE. RIFAI PROCEEDED TO IDENTIFY FOLLOWING SIX ISSUES IN ""CONSTRUCTION OF PEACE"":\n8. IN CONCLUSION, RIAFI SAID SOLUTION TO ME CONFLICT IS CONFIDENTIAL COMMON CONCERN AMONG ARAB STATES AND IS COLLECTIVE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THEM. JORDAN IS THEREFORE NOT PREPARED TO CONCLUDE ANY PARTIAL SETTLEMENT THAT IT FEELS IS OF JOINT INTEREST WITH OTHER ARABS AT CONFERENCE.\n9. EBAN GAVE ELOQUENT, CONSTRUCTIVE AND FOR MOST PART FORWARD-LOOKING SPEECH OF ABOUT 40 MINUTES DURATION-THE LONGEST OF THE DAY. STRESSED PEACE CONFERENCE WILL BE NEW OPPORTUNITY TO BREAK CYCLE OF VIOLENCE IN MIDDLE EAST. HE DID NOT KNOW IF IT WOULD SUCCEED IN THIS FORMIDABLE TASK, BUT PLEDGED ISRAELS BEST EFFORT. SAID TASK WOULD NOT BE EASY, AND IT WOULD BE UNREALISTIC TO EXPECT RAPID PROGRESS. ISRAEL COULD NOT IGNORE EXPERIENCE OF PAST, BUT ON OTHER HAND IT WOULD NOT ALLOW THAT EXPERIENCE TO PRODUCE DESPAIR.\n0. EBAN SAID CENTRAL QUESTION BEFORE THIS CONFERENCE WOULD BE WHETHER THE STATES CONCERNED COULD BREAK OUT OF OLD DEADLOCKS INTO ""NEW VISION"" OF PEACE FOR MIDDLE EAST. TO START WITH, IT WAS VITAL THAT CEASE-FIRE BE OBSERVED ON LAND, AIR AND SEA. EBAN INVITED CONFEREES TO COMMIT THEMSELVES ANEW TO OBSERVANCE OF CEASE-FIRE. THIS WAS INDISPENSABLE CONDITION FOR FURTHER NEGOTIATIONS. BEYOND THIS, ISRAELS GOAL WAS PEACE TREATY WHICH WOULD DEFINE TERMS OF ISRAELS EXISTENCE IN REGION IN FUTURE YEARS. SIMPLE EXTENSION OF CEASE-FIRE OR ARMISTICE WOULD NOT BE SUFFICIENT, NOR WOULD MERE ABSENCE OF WAR. NEITHER COULD PEACE SETTLEMENT REST ON DOCUMENTS ALONE. EBAN DEFINED ISRAELS GOAL AS CREATION OF ""COMMON REGIONAL INTERESTS OF SUCH INTENSITY"", AND ""SUCH ENTANGLEMENT OF MUTUAL ADVANTAGE"", AS TO PLACE RENEWAL OF WARFARE OUTSIDE OF REALM OF PROBABILITY.\n1. EBAN SAID PEACE TREATY SHOULD BE FREELY ARRIVED AT, SHOULD PUT AN END TO BOYCOTT AND BLOCKADE, PROVIDE FOR PREVENTION OF USE OF FORCE, PROHIBIT ANY HOSTILE ACTION, INCLUDING TERRORISM AND PROCLAIM PERMANENT END OF CONFLICT. EBAN SAID ISRAEL WILL SEEK TO LEARN FROM ARABS AT GENEVA WHETHER THEY SHARE ITS VISION OF PEACE; IF SO THERE WILL STILL BE MANY DIFFICULTIES BUT THE TASK WILL BE MUCH EASIER. DECISIVE TEST FOR ISRAEL, EBAN SAID, WILL BE DEFENSIBILITY OF ITS BOUNDARIES; THERE CANNOT BE RETURN TO FORMER BOUNDARIES OF 1967, ""WHICH SERVED AS TEMPTATION TO AGGRESSION"", BUT CONFIDENTIAL ISRAEL IS READY FOR CONCESSIONS WHICH DO NOT COMPROMISE SECURITY. OVERRIDING THEME OF PEACE CONFERENCE FOR ISRAEL, EBAN SAID, WILL BE SECURITY. ATTAINMENT OF PEACE WILL MAKE POSSIBLE SOLUTION OF REFUGEE PROBLEM THROUGH REGIONAL COOPERATION. ARAB REFUGEE PROBLEM NOT BASICALLY INTRACTABLE AND AT APPROPRIATE STAGE ISRAEL WILL DEFINE ITS CONTRIBUTION TO REFUGEE SOLUTION. EBAN SAID ISRAEL IS OPPOSED TO ""ANY EXPLOSIVE FRAGMENTATION"" OF AREAS BETWEEN MEDITERRANEAN AND DESERT. IN THIS REGION, HE SAID, THERE IS ROOM FOR ONLY TWO STATES, NOT THREE. RE JERUSALEM, EBAN SAID ISRAEL IS DEEPLY AWARE IT IS CRADLE OF TWO OTHER GREAT RELIGIONS AND DOES NOT WANT TO EXERCISE AUTHORITY OVER HOLY PLACES OF ISLAM AND CHRISTIANITY.\n2. EBAN SAID DISENGAGEMENT OF FORCES WAS LOGICAL FIRST TOPIC FOR CONFERENCE TO TAKE UP. HE SAID ABSENCE OF SYRIANS WAS REGRETTABLE, BUT COULD NOT SAY THAT SYRIA COULD QUALIFY FOR PEACE CONFERENCE AS LONG AS IT CONTINUED IN VIOLATION OF BASIC HUMAN DECENCIES. EBAN SAID 42 ISRAELI PRISONERS OF WAR HAD BEEN MURDERED IN COLD BLOOD BY SYRIANS. SAID OBLIGATIONS UNDER 3RD GENEVA CONVENTION WERE UNCONDITIONAL. IN SPITE OF ITS OUTRAGE AT THESE CRIMES, ISRAEL HAD NEVERTHELESS OFFERED SYRIANS EXCHANGE OF POWS, RETURN OF CIVILIANS TO TERRITORY OCCUPIED IN OCTOBER WAR, AND HANDING OVER TO UNEF OF TWO SYRIAN POSITIONS CAPTURED BY ISRAEL BETWEEN OCTOBER 22-24.\n3. EBAN EXPRESSED HOPE THAT IN NEXT STATE CONFERENCE WOULD ADOPT COMPACT, EFFECTIVE PROCEDURES THAT WOULD ENABLE BUSINESS-LIKE PROGRESS TO BE MADE. ISRAEL DID NOT RULE OUT POSSIBILITY OF AGREED, PHASED APPROACH TO PEACE SETTLEMENT BUT SAID CONFERENCE SHOULD NOT BE SATISFIED BY ANYTHING LESS THAN REAL PEACE AS ITS ULTIMATE OBJECTIVE. EBAN SAID ISRAEL ACCEPTED US AND SOVIET AUSPICES AS REALISTIC REFLECTION OF POWER STRUCTURE IN AREA. SAID HE UNDERSTOOD FROM GROMYKOS SPEECH THAT SOVIETS ACCEPTED ISRAELS EXISTENCE, BUT SAID LANGUAGE EMANATING FROM ALGERIAN SUMMIT MADE HIM LESS CERTAIN THAT ARABS HAD MADE SIMILAR COMMITMENT. EBAN CLOSED BY CALLING ON CONFERENCE TO PROVIDE MAXIMUM OPPORTUNITY FOR PARTIES THEMSELVES TO ENGAGE IN DIALOGUE SO THAT THEY COULD REACH ACCORD ON ISSUED DIVIDING THEM. CONFIDENTIAL 24.

want to give you a brief report on the six and one half hour conversation                        I had with President AsadSee Document 393We discussed the date of the opening of the conference and he has no                        objection to a postponement to the 21st After a rather detailed discussion                        on the content of the draft USUSSR                        letter to the Secretary General President Asad said that he is prepared to go along with any                        formulation which is acceptable to youI discussed with him frankly the difficulties which Israel is finding with                        the draft letter and in particular to the reference to the Palestinians in                        the letter I discussed with President Asad the following reformulation of the last sentence in                        paragraph 2 which I hope you will find acceptable It would read The                        parties have also agreed that the question of other participants from the                        Middle East area will be discussed during the first stage of the                        conference If you agree to this revision I will make a major effort in                        Israel on SundayDecember 16 to get its                        approvalHowever I regret to report that I learned for the first time that President                            Asad is very hesitant about                        coming to the conference unless there is prior agreement on the precise line                        of disengagement in the Golan Heights I frankly told President Asad that in my judgment it would be a serious mistake if he decided                        not to participate in the conference I pointed out that getting agreement                        on a specific line of disengagement before the conference would be                        impossible I explained that for example there had been no military                        representative talks between the Syrians and Israelis as there have been                        between your representatives and those of Israel Without some prior                        indication of the position of both sides as was the case in the discussions                        of the EgyptianIsraeli military representatives I could not be expected                        before the 21st to produce such an agreement and that I would not promise                        what I could not produce I did state to President Asad my firm belief that once the                        conference is convened and a SyrianIsraeli subgroup is formed that it                        would be possible for me to make a major effort in the month of January with                        a view to achieving a disengagement agreement on the SyrianIsraeli front as                        we hope and expect on the EgyptianIsraeli frontI hope that you will find a way to communicate with President Asad in light of the above report I hope                        you will urge him to attend the conference If the conference fails now all                        the momentum I have built up and all the hopes we have had will be                        dissipatedIf you agree with revised formulation in the letter given above I intend to                        ask the Soviets to have their Ambassador in Damascus present the draft                        letter to the Syrians and then they can decide how they will respond to the                        Secretary Generals invitation I intend also to ask the Soviets to urge an                        affirmative decision on the Syrians and I hope that you will do the                            sameIn telegram Secto 1416637 from Amman to Cairo

SUMMARY:  YARG FONMIN NUMAN VIEWS ALGIERS CONFERENCES AS SUCCESS THAT LEAVES SADAT A FREE HAND TO CONFIDENTIAL NEGOTIATE IN GENEVA. NUMAN PARTICULARLY GRATIFIED BY CONFERENCES SUPPORT FOR CREATION OF PALESTINIAN ENTITY. HE BELIEVES PALESTINE REPRESENTATION IN GENEVA WILL BE USEFUL; PALESTINIANS CAN DO THEIR OWN TALKING AND OTHER ARAB GOVERNMENTS WILL NO LONGER BE HOSTAGE TO THEIR UNREALISTIC CLAIMS. SYRIANS ARE WOBBLY AND ASADS PERSONAL POSITION IS PRECARIOUS. IT WOULD BE WELL FOR USG SHOW SOME SOLICITUDE TO HELP THEM STAY IN THE GAME. NUMANS PERSONAL RECOMMENDATION IS SOME FORM OF MESSAGE FROM SECRETARY KISSINGER TO SYRIAN FONMIN KHADDAM.\n2. AMBASSADOR SAW DEPPRIMIN/FONMIN NUMAN EVENING NOVEMDIR 30 FOLLOWING RETURN OF YAR DELEGATION TO ALGIERS CONFERENCES.\n3. NUMAN THROUGHT ALGIERS CONFERENCES HAD BEEN VERY SUCCESSFUL. THEY HAD ACHIEVED HOPED-FOR RESULT OF LEAVING SADAT A FREE HAND TO NEGOTIATE IN GENEVA. SUMMIT ENDORSEMENT OF PALESTINE ENTITY, IN FAVOR OF WHICH NUMAN HAD SPOKEN ON THE FLOOR, INTENDED BE HELPFUL TO SADAT. WITH PALESTINIANS SPEAKING ONTHEIR OWN BEHALF IN GENEVA, OTHER ARAB LEADERS WOULD NO LONGER BE HOSTAGE TO THEIR UNREALISTICALLY EXTREME POSITIONS. IN FACE OF CALL FOR PALESTINIAN ENTITY, JORDANS CAPABLE ABDUL-MUNIM RIFAI HAD PLAYED IT COOL. AVOIDING ACRIMONIOUS DEBATE, HE HAD SIMPLY ASKED QUIETLY THAT RECORD SHOW GOJ RESERVED ITS POSITION.\n4. NUMAN GAVE BOUMEDIENNE A LOT OF THE CREDIT FOR SMOOTHNESS OF CONFERENCEDELIBERATIONS. BOUMEDIENNE, HE SAID, HAD SHOWN COMPLETE UNDERSTANDING AND SYMPATHY WITH SADATS OBJECTIVE OF AN HONORABLE, FINAL PEACE SETTLEMENT OBTAINED THROUGH NEGOTIATION. HE HAD WORKED CAPABLY BEHIND THE SCENES TO MAKE SURE THAT OTHER ARAB DIFFERENCES DID NOT INTERFERE WITH CENTRAL OBJECTIVE OF WINNING BROADEST SUPPORT FOR A POLITICAL SOLUTION.\n5. NUMAN SAID HIS ONLY WORRY WAS SYRIA. SYRIAN GOVERNMENT EXPOSED AND WOBBLY. ASADS POSITON VUL- NERABLE. SYRIA HAD IN GOOD FAITH THROWN EVERYTHING IT CONFIDENTIAL HAD INTO THE BATTLE WITH ISRAEL ONLY TO BE CALLED OFF BY A CEASE-FIRE ON WHICH IT HAD NOT BEEN CONSUL- TED. SINCE THE WAR, SYRIAN LOSSES HAD NOT BEEN FULLY MADE UP BY SOVIETS APPARENTLY IN BELIEF THIS WOULD KEEP SARG PLIABLE. SYRIAN REGIME MUCH MORE SENSITIVE TO IRAQI PRESSURES AND ACCUSATIONS THAN SADAT TO QADHAFI. THIS\n6. NUMAN REMARKED THAT ALGIERS CONFERENCES HAD ALSO BEEN USEFUL ON SOME PERIPHERAL ISSUES. HE AND KUWAITI FOREIGN MINISTER HAD JOINED IN CALLING FOR RESTORATION OF RELATIONS BETWEEN ARAB STATES WHERE SUCH RELATIONS DID NOT EXIST. SPECIFICALLY THEY HAD IN MIND ABSENCE OF RELATIONS BETWEEN (A) SAUDI ARABIA AND ABU DHABI AND (B) PDRY AND ABU DHABI AND OMAN. ALGIERS PROVIDED FURTHER OPPORTUNITY FOR QUIET DISCUSSION BET- WEEN FAISALS INTELLIGENCE ADVISER ADHAM AND ABU DHABI FOREIGN MINISTER SUWEIDI, WITH KUWAIT FOREIGN MINISTER IN THE MIDDLE, LOOKING TOWARD FORMULA FOR RESOLUTION OF DIFFERENCES BETWEEN FAISAL AND SHAIKH ZAYID. FURTHER PROGRESS ALSO MADE IN YAR-PUBRY RELATIONS (SEPTEL). LIBYA AND IRAQ WERE NOT MUCH MISSED BUT, OVER SAUDI GRUMBLING, SENSE OF THE MEETING WAS PUT IN THE RECORD STATING CONFERENCE WOULD BE GRATEFUL TO ANY STATE WHICH WILLING MADE CONTACT WITH IRAQ OR LIBYA TO BRING THEM INTO PICTURE AND WIN THEIR SUPPORT FOR CONFERENCE CONCLUSIONS.

THERE FOLLOWS VERBATIME ADVANCE TEXT (UNNECESSARY WORDS OMITTED) OF PRIMIN MEIRS SPEECH DEC 20 BEFORE KNESSET, EXCEPT FOR FIRT THREE PARAGRAPHS WHICH WE HAVE SUMMARIZED.\n2. AFTER ENTAILING VIRTUES OF CEASEFIRE STABILIAZTION AGREEMENT OF NOV 11 AND KM 101 TALKS, MRS MEIR CONTINUED: BEGIN TEXT. THE TALKS HAVE BEEN BROKEN OFF, TO OUR GREAT REGRET, BUT NEED TO STABILIZE CEASEFIRE BY SEPARATION OF FORCES REMAINED. WE EXPRESSED OUR READINESS TO RESUME DISCUSSION OF SUBJECT WHEN PEACE CONFERENCE CONVENES, IN HOPE OF REACHING AN AGREE- MENT. BREAKING- OFF OF TALKS AT KM 101 ON EGYPTS INITIATIVE MADE IT NECESSARY TO EXERCISE REDOUBLED ALERTNESS IN MILITARY AREA, IN VIEW OF POSSIBILITY OF AGRESSIVE MOVES ON PART OF EGYPT. UNCLASSIFIED 3. REGRETTABLY DESPITE EGYPTIAN GOVERNMENTS COMMITMENT TO CEASEFIRE, BREACHES OF CEASEFIRE OCCUR ALMOST EVERY DAY THROUGH FIRE FROM EGYPTIAN ARMY POSITIONS TOWARDS OUR FORCES. HUNDREDS OF SUCH INCIDENTS HAVE TAKEN PLACE SINCE OCT 24, AND THER HAVE EVEN BEEN CASUALTIES. ON THIS OCCASION, I CALL UPON EGYPTIAN AUTHORITIES TO COMPLY WITH THEIR OBLIGATION TO OBSERVE CEASEFIRE-- TO PUT SAFETY-CATCH ON THEIR ARMS.\n4. ALL THIS TIME, US SECRETARY OF STATE KISSINGER, HAS BEEN CONTINUING HIS EFFORTS TO GET AGREEMENT FROM PARTIES CONCERNED TO TAKE PART IN PEACE CONFERENCE BETWEEN OURSELVES AND OUR NEIGHBORS. IN COURSE OF HIS EFFORTS, HE HAS VISITED ARAB CAPITALS AND CAPITAL OF ISRAEL. IN OUR TALKS IN JERUSALEM, FOLLOW- ING UPON MY TALKS WITH HIM IN WASHINGTON, I DISCUSSED WITH SECRETARY OF STATE IMPORTANH ISSURES IN CONNECTION WITH CONFERENCE. QUESTION OF AUSPICES FOR CONFERENCE, STATES WHOSE REPRESENTATIVES WOULD BE INVITED, STAGES OF DISCUSSIONS, AND SO FORTH, WERE DISCUSSED. WE ALSO HELD DETAILED DISCUSSION ON QUESTION OF SEPARATION OF FORCES, AND ISSUE WHICH DR KISSINGER WISHED TO STUDY THOROUGHLY IN CONTACTS WITH AUTHORITIES OF EGYPT AND ISRAEL. THIS DISCUSSION HAS NOT YET BEEN COMPLETED.\n5. SPONSORS OF CONFERENCE--UNITED STATES AND SOVIET UNION-- HAD INTENDED TO CONVENE IT ON DEC 18, BUT THEY HAD TO COMMUNI- CATE WITH GOVERNMENTS CONCERNING THEIR LETTER TO UN SECRETARY GENERAL, WHO IS CONVENING CONFERENCE. AS A RESULT OF THESE DISCUSSIONS WITH THE PARTIES--ISRAEL INCLUDED--THERE WAS A POSTPONEMENT. IN LETER FROM US AND USSR TO UN SECRETARY GENERAL, DATED DEC 18, 1973, WHICH WAS COMPOSED FOLLOWING DELIBERATIONS WITH THE PARTIES, IT IS STATED: (VERBATIM TEXT OF SYGS LETTER OF INVITATION AS CONTAINED USUN 5704 FOLLOWS.)\n6. US SECRETARY OF STATE ATTACHED SUPREME IMPORTANCE TO OPENING CONFERENCE WITHIN MONTH OF DECEMBER. IT APPEARS TO ME THAT HE WAS ANXIOUS OVER POSSIBILITY OF ANY POSTPONEMENT, LEST OBSTACLES CROPPED UP AND POSSIBLY EVEN FIRING WAS RESUMED. WE TOO, FOR OUR PART, WERE NOT INTERESTED INDELAYS OR POSTPONE- MENTS FOR VERY SAME REASONS. OUR FORCES ARE DEPLOYED AGAINST ANY AGGRESSIVE INITIATIVE BY EGYPT OR SYRIA, BUT WE DO NOT WANT RESUMPTION OF WAR. UNCLASSIFIED 7. ISRAEL AGREEMENT WAS, THEREFORE, GIVEN TO OPENING OF CONFERENCE IN DECEMBER, PROVIDED SUBSTATIVE DISCUSSIONS ON VARIOUS ASPECTS OF SUBJECT OF PEACE ARE HELD AT LATER DATE, AFTER ELECTIONS TO EIGHT KNESSET, AND ARE CONDUCTED ON RESPONSIBILITY OF A CABINET WHICH SHALL HAVE RECEIVED CONFIDENCE OF NEW KNESSET. I AM HAPPY TO NOTE THAT THIS CONDI- TION OF OURS HAS BEEN ACCEPTED. CONFERENCE WILL OPEN TOMORROW, FRIDAY, DEC 21, 1973, BEFORE KNESSET ELECTIONS, BUT INITIAL STAGE WILL BE BRIEF AND FORMAL ONLY AND WILL LAST TWO DAYS. AT OPENING CEREMONY, ADDRESSES WILL BE DELIVERED BY FOREIGN MINISTERS OF INVITED STATES, AS WELL AS FOREIGN MINISTERS OF UNITED STATES AND SOVIET UNION AND SECRETARY GENERAL OF UNITED NATIONS. THERE WILL BE AN INTERVAL THEREAFTER, AND CONFERENCE WILL BE RESUMED IN COURSE OF JANUARY.\n8. AS AFORSAID, CONFERENCE STARTS TOMORROW, AND MUCH TO OUR REGRET, DESPITE ALL OUR EFFORTS TO ENSURE THAT THERE WILL BE NO SESSIONS ON SABBATH, NO WAY WAS FOUND TO CHANGE TIMING DETERMINED, AND IT WILL INDEED CONTINUE ALSO ON SATURDAY, DEC 22, 1973.\n9. OPENING STAGE WILL LAST ONLY TWO DAYS, BUT DURING THIS SHORT PERIOD ARRANGEMENTS AND PROCEDURES WILL BE DETERMINED WHICH WILL INFLUENCE ENTIRE COURSE OF CONFERENCE, AND IT DOES NOT APPEAR FEASIBLE TO ME THAT WE CAN AFFORD TO BE ABSENT FROM HALF THE TIME OF DISCUSSIONS. MINISTER FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS ANNOUNCED AT CABINET SESSION THAT ISRAELS REPRESENTATIVES WHO WILL BE COMPELLED-- IN THIS GIVEN SITUATION-TO PARTICIPATE IN DISCUSSIONS ON SATURDAY, WILL, OF COURS, SCRUPULOUSLY REFRAIN FROM DESE- CRATING SABBATH.\n0. ALMOST CERTAINLY, FIRST MATTER TO BE DEALT WITH BY CONFERENCE IN JANUARY 1974 WILL BE DISENGAGEMENT OF FORCES, WHICH IS PART OF CEASEFIRE AGREEMENT (ARTICLE 2 OF SIX-POINT AGREEMENT). I HAVE NOTED THAT PRESIDENT SADAT HAS SAID PUBLICLY THAT HE ALSO IS PREPARED TO MAKE PROGRESS IN DISCUSSIONS ON THIS SUBJECT, AND WE SHALL BE PREPARED TO TAKE PART IN THESE DISCUSSIONS EVEN BEFORE NEW GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN FORMED. AS I HAVE SAID, PRINCI- PAL STAGE OF CONFERENCE WILL BEGIN AND CONTINUE ACCORDING TO DIRECTIVES OF NEW GOVERNMENT. UNCLASSIFIED UNCLASSIFIED\n1. IN ORAL AND WRITTEN CONTACTS WITH PRESIDENT OF UNITED STATES, MR RICHARD NIXON, AND SECRETARY OF STATE, DR KISSINGER, MAIN CONDITIONS AND POLITICAL FRAMEWORK FOR CONVENING OF CONFERENCE HAVE BEEN THOROUGHLY CLARIFIED. IN COURSE OF THESE CONTACTS, WE HAVE AGREED TO DEFINITION OF FUNCTION OF UNITED NATIONS. FUNCTION ALLOTTED TO UN HAS BEEN THOROUGHLY CLARIFIED: AUSPICES OF UN ARE LIMITED TO CONVENING OF CONFERENCE. UN SECRETARY GENERAL, DR WALDHEIM, WILL SERVE AS CONVENER OF CONFERENCE AND CHAIRMAN AT ITS OPENING SESSION. UN SECRETARY GENERAL DISPATCHED INVITATIONS AT REQUEST OF US AND USSR, IN THEIR LETTER WHICH I HAVE ALREADY MENTIONED. HE WILL ENSURE THAT UN ORGANIZATION WILL PLACE AT DISPOSAL OF CONFERENCE SERVICES REQUIRED FOR EFFECTIVE WORKING.\n2. ON DEC 15, SECURITY COUNCIL ADOPTED DISTURBING RESOLU- TION IN REFERENCE TO PEACE CONFERENCE. FOUR OF PERMANENT MEMBERS, INCLUDING US AND USSR, ABSTAINED. LET US RECALL THAT ISRAEL HAS NO DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS WITH FIVE OUT OF TEN STATES THAT VOTED FOR RESOLUTION. I MUST MAKE IT CLEAR THAT ANY ATTEMPT TO INCLUDE SUB- JECTS OF DISCUSSIONS AT PEACE CONFERENCE WITHIN ACTIVITY AND AUTHORITY OF SECURITY COUNCIL WILL BE IN DANGEROUS CONTRADICTION TO BASIS AND PURPOSE OF CONFERENCE, AND WILL MEET WITH EXPLICIT UNCLASSIFIED OPPOSITION ON OUR PART. IT IS INCONCEIVABLE THAT US SHOULD ACQUIESCE IN SUCH A BREACH OF AGREED ASSUMPTIONS. WE SHALL NOT FIND OURSELVES ISOLATED IN FACING SUCH A DANGEROUS MOVE, WHICH VIOLATES CONSENT WHICH IS BASIS OF PEACE CONFERENCE.\n3. ARAB STATES WHICH HAVE BEEN INVITED TO TAKE PART IN CONFERENCE ARE EGYPT, JORDAN AND SYRIA, LEBANON HAS NOT YET BEEN INVITED, BUT I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT IT WILL BE INVITED AT LATER STAGE. EGYPT AND JORDAN HAVE ACCEPTED INVITATION, WHILE SYRIA HAS REPLIED IN NEGATIVE.\n4. WITH GREAT REGRET I HAVE TO INFORM HOUSE THAT SYRIAN RULERS STILL REPLY WITH FLAT REFUSAL TO OUR DEMAND FOR LIBERATION OF OUR PRISONERS. ON OUR PART PROPOSALS HAVE BEEN MADE TO THEM WHICH ARE BEYOND LIMITS OF OUR COMMITMENTS-- BUT IN VAIN. INFLUENTIAL POLITICAL ELEMENTS HAVE REPEATEDLY APPEALED TO SYRIAN RULERS--WITHOUT EFFECT. PRESIDENT OF SYRIA, WHO WAS ASKED TO DISCUSS SUBJECT OF PRISONERS, STATED THAT FROM HUMANITARIAN ASPECT THIS WAS NOT SUBJECT REQUIRING PARTICULAR DISCUSSION. AND NOW SYRIANS HAVE DECLARED THAT THEY WILL NOT BE COMING TO GENEVA.\n5. I DO NOT KNOW HOW SYRIANS EXPLAIN THEIR REFUSAL TO TAKE PART IN PEACE CONFERENCE. EVEN BEFORE THEY CAME OUT WITH THIS STATEMENT WE MADE IT CLEAR- BOTH FROM KNESSET ROSTRUM AND TO REPRESENTATIVES OF US- THAT AS LONG AS NO LIST OF OUR PRISONERS IS RECEIVED BY US AND RED CROSS IS NOT PERMITTED TO VISIT THEM, WE CANNOT SIT DOWN WITH THEM AT GENEVA CONFERENCE AT ANY STAGE.\n6. WE TRIED  TO MAKE CONTACT WITH SYRIANS THROUGH REPRESENTA- TIVES OF US AND OF REDCROSS. THROUGH US REPRESENTATIVE WE LEARNED OF SYRIAN PROPSOAL THAT WE AGREE TO RETURN OF 15,000 SYRIAN CITIZENS TO AREAS CAPTURED BY IDF IN YOM KIPPUR WAR, AND TO RETURN TWO SYRIAN POSITONS ON MT. HERMON. IF WE COMPLIED THERE WOULD BE AN EXCHANGE OF PRISONERS. WE AGREED TO RETURN OF CIVILIANS AND TO STATIONING OF UN FORCES IN TWO POSITIONS REFERRED TO. WHAT IS MORE, IN MY TALK WITH DR. GUYER, ASSISTANT SECRETARY-GENERAL OF UN, I PROPOSED THAT MEETING BETWEEN SENIOR ISRAELI AND SYRIAN OFFICERS BE HELD, SIMILAR TO KILOMETER 101. WE DIDNOT UNCLASSIFIED RECEIVE ANY AFFIRMATIVE REPLY.\n7. I REALIZE AND UNDERSTAND WHAT MUST BE FEELINGS OF FAMILIES WHOSE DEAR ONES HAVE BEEN TAKEN PRISONER BY SYRIANS. ALL OF US ARE AGHAST AT DREADFUL NEWS AND RUMOURS WHICH HAVE REACHED US. WE SHALL NOT CEASE IN OUR EFFORTS TO SECURE INTER- VENTION OF FACTORS WHICH CAN SPEED UP LIBERATION OF OUR SOLDIERS. SYRIAN RULERS ARE ASSUMING TERRIBLE RESPONSIBILITY, AND WE WILL NOT EXEMPT THEM FROM THIS RESPONSIBILITY.\n8. NEGOTIATIONS ON PEACE IN MIDDLE EAST MUST BE CONDUCTED BETWEEN STATES CONCERNED: NAMELY, BETWEEN ISRAEL ON ONE HAND AND ISRAELS NEIGHBOURS-EGYPT, JORDAN, SYRIA AND LEBANON- ON THE OTHER. THERE IS NO REASON TO INVITE TO PARTICIPATE IN THESE NEGOTIATIONS ANY ADDITIONAL STATES BESIDES US AND USSR, WHICH UNDERTOOK SPONSORSHIP OF CONFERENCE. THERE IS NO CONCEIVABLE OBJECTIVE CRITERION BY WHICH ADDITIONAL STATES SHOULD BE INVITED. WE ARE AWARE OF FACT THAT REPRESENTATIVES OF VARIOUS STATES HAVE EXPRESSED THEIR WISH TO TAKE PART IN CONFERENCE. THIS INCLUDES STATES NOT OUTSTANDING IN THEIR NEUTRALITY. ISRAEL GOVENMENT HAS EXPRESSED ITS OPPOSITION TO INVITATION OF ADDITIONAL STATES OR OF NON-SOVEREIGN FACTORS, AND WE ARE CONVINCED THAT BY THIS OPPOSITION WE ARE SAFEGUARDING CONFERENCE AGAINST DANGEROUS COMPLICATIONS.\n9. IT IS ONLY NATURAL THAT WE SHOULD HAVE VOICED OUR EXPLICIT OPPOSITION TO ANY NOTION OF INVITING TERRORIST ORGANIZATIONS UNDER THE AEGIS OF PLO OR ANY OTHER ORGANIZATION, AT ANY STAGE WHATSOEVER. IT IS INCONCEIVABLE THAT WE SHOULD AGREE TO TAKE PART IN CONFERENCE TO WHICH REPRESENTATIVES OF THESE ORGANIZATIONS SHOULD BE INVITED, NOT TO SPEEK OF NEGOTIATING WITH REPRESENTATIVES OF ORGANIZATIONS WHOSE DECLARED AIM IS DESTRUCTION OF STATE OF ISREL. WE HAVE NO COMMON DENOMINATOR WITH ORGANIZATINS THAT ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR ACTS OF TERRORISM AND MURDER. WE SHALL NEGOTIATE WITH REPRESENTATIVES OF NEIGHBOURING STATES, WITH WHICH WE HAVE CEASE-FIRE AGREEMENTS.\n0. WE ARE NOT IGNORING DISTURBING FACT THAT ONE OF POWERS UNDER WHOSE AUSPICES CONFERENCE IS MEETING HAS SEVERED DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS WITH ISRAEL. THIS POWER PLAYED CONSIDERABLE PART IN DEVELOPING ARAB MILITARY STRENGTH AND IN PREPARING EGYPT AND SYRIA FOR WAR.IN COURSE OF CONFERENCE, IT WILL BECOME CLEAR WHETHER THIS POWER IS ACUALLY CONDUCTING ITSELF IN MANNER FITTING TO AIM OF PEACE CONFERENCE.\n1. I AM CONVINCED THAT POLICY OF US AT PEACE CONFERENCE WILL BE GUIDED BY SONCERE GOODWILL AND WILL BE DESIGNED TO OFFER AID TO PARTIES, AS REQUIRED,D IN ORDER TO BRING ABOUT SUCCESSFUL CONCLUSION OF NEGOTIATIONS AND ACHIEVE CONTRACTUAL AND BINDING PEACE TREATY.\n2. ROLE FULFILLED BY US SINCE OCTOBER 6 AND UNTIRING EFFORTS OF SECRETARY OF STATE KISSINGER IN CAIRO, AMMAN AND OTHER ARAB CAPITALS HAVE BEEN OF NO SMALL ASSISTANCE TO CESSATION OF HOSTILITIES AND TO ACHIEVEMENT OF SIX-POINT AGREEMENT REPRESENTING LOGICAL AND OPERATIONAL CONTINUATION OF THE SECURITY COUNCILS CEASE-FIRE RESOLUTION. WE ARE ENCOURAGED BY CLEAR-CUT STAND OF US, AS FREQUENTLY EXPRESSED IN PUBLIC, IN FAVOUR OF DIRECT NEGOTIATIONS BETWEEN PARTIES. UNCLASSIFIED WITH HELP OF THIS CLEAR-CUT POLICY, WE HOPE TO ACHIEVE SIGNIFICANT AND DIRECT NEGOTIATIONS WITH EACH OF ARAB STAES BORDERING UPON ISRAEL, AND TO ADVANCE TOWARDS SETTLEMENT OF QUESTIONS IN DISPUTE.\n3. WE ATTACH SUPREME IMPORANCE TO WHAT IS STATED IN SC RE 338 ON SUBJECT OF NEGOTIATIONS. THIS TIME THERE IS EXPLICIT REFERENCE TO NEGOTIATIONS BETWEEEN PARTIES: UP TO THAT POINT THERE HAD BEEN NO LACK OF ATTEMPTS AT MEDIATION, SPONSORSHIP AND GOOD MFFICES, ALL OF THEM WITHOUT DIRECT NEGOTIATIONS. ISRAEL WILL BE ON WATCH THAT NO MISINTERPRETATION SHALL ARISE ON THIS PMINT, WHICH IS POSITIVE AND SIGNIFICANT INNOVATION IN SECURITY COUNCIL RESOLUTION 338.\n4. GOVERNMENT OF ISRAEL WILL SEND IT AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVES TO PEACE CONFERENCE WITH CLEAR CUT DIRECTIVES TO MAKE EVERY EFFORT TO ADVANCE TOWARDS AND ATTAIN PEACE. SUBSTANTIVE DIRECTIVES WILL BE ISSURE BY NEW GOVERMENT, AND I DO NOT TAKE IT UPON MYSELF TO DEFINE NOW ITS ATTITUDES ON MAJOR POINTS AT ISSURE. HOWEVER, I HOPE AND BELIEVE THAT NEW GOVERN- MENT TO BE ESTABLISHED BY EIGHTH KNESSET AFTER ELECTIONS WILL EXPRESS OUR PEOPLES YEARNINGS OF PEACE WITHIN DEFENSIBLE BORDERS.\n5. ON THRESHHOLD OF CONFERENCE, I SHALL MAKE NO ATTEMPT TO EXAMINE ATTITUES OF GOVERNMENTS OF ARAB STATES. THERE WILL BE TIME FOR THIS IN COURSE OF DISCUSSIONS AT CONFERENCE. INFLU- ENCE OF ALGIERS CONFERENCE, ITS DELIBERATIONS AND RESOLUTIONS, CANNOT BUT GIVE RISE TO CONCERN. HOWEVER, WE SHALL NOT CEASE TO HOPE FOR A TURNING POINT, A NEW APPROACH, FOR THROWING OFF OF SHACKLES OF EXTREME ATTITUDES DEVOID OF ANY SENSE OF REALITY. I WOULD LIKE ARAB STATES TO PROCEED TO PEACE CONFERENCE IN SAME SPIRIT OF SINCERITY, IMBUSED WITH SAME INSPIRATIONS THAT ANIMATE PEOPLE AND GOVERNMENT OF ISRAEL- FOR THEN ROAD TO PEACE WILL BE SMOOTH IN BOTH DIRECTIONS.\n6. SEVENT KNESSET IS CONCLUDING ITS TERM OF OFFICE IN WAKE OF DIFFICULT TRIALS AND SIGNIFICANT VICTORY OF YOM KIPPUR WAR. PEACE CONFERENCE WILL BE OPENING WITH SEVENTH KNESSET NOT YET HAVING COMPLETED ITS TERM. UNCLASSIFIED NO EFFORT MUST BE SPARED TO ENABLE STATE OF ISRAEL-DURING TERM OF EIGHTH KNESSET TO REACH AN AGREEMENT ON SEPARATION OF FORCES AND, WHAT IS MORE, ACHIEVE CNETRAL OBJECTIVES OF OUR POLICY- A LATING PEACE. ONCE STAGE OF SUBSTANTIVE DISCUSSIONS IS REACHED, ISRAELS DELEGATES WILL STRIVE FOR CONTRA- TUAL PEACE BETWEEN PARTIES, WITH DEFENSIBLE BORDERS, AND IN ACCORDANCE WITH GUIDELINES WHICH, IN MY BELIEF, WILL BE EXPRESSED IN BASIC POLICY OF NEXT GOVERNMENT.\n7. ISRAELS PARTICIPATION IN TALKS IS NOT SUBJECT TO ANY PRIOR CONDITIONS. ISRAEL HAS NOT DEMANDED PRIOR ACCEPTANCE OF HER POSITIONS BY OTHER PARTIES, NOR IS SHE ACCEPT- ING BEFOREHAND CONDITIONS OF OTHER PARTIES, AS STATED BY THEM PUBLICLY AND OTHERWISE, BUT EACH SIDE WILL BE FREE TO SUBMIT ITS PROPOSALS ON THE SUBJECTS UNDER DISCUSSION.\n8. WE ARE AWARE OF DIFFICULTIES AND STRUGGLES AHEAD OF US. WE ARE ALERT TO DANGERS. NEVERTHELESS, ISRAELS EMISSARIES WILL GO TO PEACE CONFERENCE SOBERLY, WHOLEHEARTEDLY, AND COURAGEOUSLY. WE SHALL LET NO-ONE TAKE THE NAME OF PEACE IN VAIN. WE SHALL NOT CEASE TO STRIVE FOR A FULL PEACE-IN SIMPLE SENSE OF TERM-A PEACE TO END WARS, WHICH WILL OPEN UP BRIGHT PROSPECTS FOR UNDISTURBED DEVELOPEMTN OF A LIFE OF CREATIVE PROGRESS FOR EACH AND EVERY ONE OF PEOPLES AND STATES IN MIDDLE EAST.

57,0.5450429515488429,Secto 1336628 For Ambassador Eilts From the Secretary Subject: Peace                        Conference Please pass the following oral message to President Sadat through FahmiI want to give you a brief report on the six and one half hour conversation                        I had with President AsadSee Document 393We discussed the date of the opening of the conference and he has no                        objection to a postponement to the 21st After a rather detailed discussion                        on the content of the draft USUSSR                        letter to the Secretary General President Asad said that he is prepared to go along with any                        formulation which is acceptable to youI discussed with him frankly the difficulties which Israel is finding with                        the draft letter and in particular to the reference to the Palestinians in                        the letter I discussed with President Asad the following reformulation of the last sentence in                        paragraph 2 which I hope you will find acceptable It would read The                        parties have also agreed that the question of other participants from the                        Middle East area will be discussed during the first stage of the                        conference If you agree to this revision I will make a major effort in                        Israel on SundayDecember 16 to get its                        approvalHowever I regret to report that I learned for the first time that President                            Asad is very hesitant about                        coming to the conference unless there is prior agreement on the precise line                        of disengagement in the Golan Heights I frankly told President Asad that in my judgment it would be a serious mistake if he decided                        not to participate in the conference I pointed out that getting agreement                        on a specific line of disengagement before the conference would be                        impossible I explained that for example there had been no military                        representative talks between the Syrians and Israelis as there have been                        between your representatives and those of Israel Without some prior                        indication of the position of both sides as was the case in the discussions                        of the EgyptianIsraeli military representatives I could not be expected                        before the 21st to produce such an agreement and that I would not promise                        what I could not produce I did state to President Asad my firm belief that once the                        conference is convened and a SyrianIsraeli subgroup is formed that it                        would be possible for me to make a major effort in the month of January with                        a view to achieving a disengagement agreement on the SyrianIsraeli front as                        we hope and expect on the EgyptianIsraeli frontI hope that you will find a way to communicate with President Asad in light of the above report I hope                        you will urge him to attend the conference If the conference fails now all                        the momentum I have built up and all the hopes we have had will be                        dissipatedIf you agree with revised formulation in the letter given above I intend to                        ask the Soviets to have their Ambassador in Damascus present the draft                        letter to the Syrians and then they can decide how they will respond to the                        Secretary Generals invitation I intend also to ask the Soviets to urge an                        affirmative decision on the Syrians and I hope that you will do the                            sameIn telegram Secto 1416637 from Amman to Cairo

the short letter to the participants and to the Secretary                            General only if it failed to get Israeli approval of the longer draft                            letter and to emphasize that it was imperative for Sadat to weigh in with the Syrians to                            help assure that there would be an affirmative Syrian reply National

and who expressed doubt that                            further intervention with the Syrians would be successful Ibid Box                            639 Country Files Middle East Arab Republic of

ASSISTANT SECRETARY SISCO BRIEFED FRENCH AMBASSADOR FERNAND- LAURANT AND BRITISH AMBASSADOR HILDGARD SEPARATELY DEC. 22 SHORTLY BEFORE SECRETARY AND PARTY EMPLANED FOR HOME.  SISCO SAID SECRETARY REGRETTED NOT BEING ABLE TO DO THIS HIMSELF BUT PRESS OF BUSINESS PREVENTED IT.\n2. SISCO SAID CONFERENCE WENT PRETTY MUCH AS PLANNED AND AS WE EXPECTED. WE WERE DISAPPOINTED THAT THE SYRIANS DID NOT CHOOSE TO PARTICIPATE, BUT ON OTHER HAND THEIR ABSENCE PROBABLY  IMPROVED PROSPECT THAT CONFERENCE COULD FOCUS ON IMMEDIATE PROBLEMS THAT NEED TO BE SOLVED. IN THE FIRST DAYS PUBLIC SESSION, SPEECHES WERE OBVIOUSLY MAINLY FOR HOME CONSUMPTION. SISCO COMMENTED THAT OVERALL ATMOSPHERE HAD BEEN SOMETHING LESS THAN REAL WARMTH. ON PART OF EGYPTIANS IN PARTICULAR, ESPECIALLY GIVEN SYRIAN DECISION STAY AWAY, THERE HAD BEEN    SECRET  CONTINUING CONCERN AND WARINESS ABOUT VISIBLE CONTACT WITH ISRAELIS (SISCO DESCRIBED MINOR CONTRETEMPS ABOUT SEATING ARRANGEMENTS WHICH FORTUNATELY HAD BEEN QUICKLY RESOLVED). HOWEVER, ARABA AS AWELL AS ISRAELIS SEEMED TO REALIZE OPENING OF CONFERENCE WAS HISTORIC MOMENT AND PRESENTED OPPORTUNITY WHICH MUST NOT BE LOST.\n3. SISCO SAID MOST IMPORTANT RESULT OF CONFERENCE HAD BEEN REAL CONSENSUS THAT WAS ACHIEVED ON PLAN FOR ONGOING WORK OF CONFERENCE. AS CONSENSUS STATEMENT READ BY SYG INDICATED, THERE HAD BEEN AGREEMENT THAT CONFERENCE WOULD STAY IN SESSION,  AND THAT REPRESENTATIVES OF THE PARTICIPANTS WOULD REMAIN AVAILABLE AND IN TOUCH AT LEAST AT AMBASSADORIAL LEVEL. EGYPT- ISRAELI WORKING GROUP WOULD BE SET UP TO CONTINUE DISCUSSIONS ON DISENGAGEMENT AND SEPARATION OF FORCES. THIS WOULD BEGIN SOMETIME NEXT WEEK, AND  WOULD NOT WAIT FOR ISRAELI ELECTIONS. ALL THESE ARRANGEMENTS HAD BEEN WELL PREPARED IN ADVANCE IN PRIVATE DISCUSSIONS LAST EVENING AND THIS MORNING, SO THAT CONFERENCE WAS ABLE TO MEET THIS MORNING, WITH ALL THIS BUTTONED DOWN.\n4. BOTH BRITISH AND FRENCH AMBASSADORS ASKED IF SISCO FORESAW WORKING GROUP TALKS PROCEEDING ON SAME PATTERN AS KILOMETER\n5. BOTH BRITISH AND FRENCH ASKED WHETHER ANY WORK MIGHT BE  DONE ON OTHER ASPECTS WHILE EGYPT/ISRAELI DISENGAGEMENT TALKS UNDERWAY. SISCO SAID DOOR HAD BEEN LEFT OPEN FOR THIS, BUT THAT IT WOULD PROBABLY BE PREMATURE NOW. WE OURSELVES DID NOT PRESS  FOR ANYTHING LIKE THIS BECAUSE WE BELIEVE FIRMLY THAT STEP- BY-STEP APPROACH WAS BEST, AND ONCE CONCRETE PROGRESS HAD BEEN    SECRET  ACHIEVED ON GROUND, PSYCHOLOGICAL ATMOSPHERE OF CONFERENCE WOULD CHANGE, MAKING PROGRESS ON OTHER ISSUES MORE FEASIBLE. BRITISH ASKED WHETHER THIS HELD TRUE OF ISRAELI/JORDAN DISCUSSION AS WELL, AND SISCO REPLIED THAT ALTHOUGH WE HOPE SOMETHING WOULD GET STATTED ON JORDAN FRONT AS WELL, WOULD PROBABLY LAG SOMEWHAT BEHIND THE START OF EGYPT/ISRAELI TALKS.\n6.BOTH BRITISH AND FRENCH ASKED OUR ASSESSMENT OF SYRIA VIS-A-VIS CONFERENCE. SISCO SAID THAT OUR JUDGMENT WAS SYRIAN POSTURE WAS ONE OF WATCHFUL WAITING. DOOR HAD BEEN LEFT OPEN FOR THEM, AND OUR JUDGMENT WAS IF SOLID PROGRESS COULD BE MADE ON EGYPTIAN/ISRAELI DISENGAGEMENT, SYRIANS WOULD WANT TO COME IN AT SUBSEQUENT STAGE. ON QUESTION SOVIET ATTITUDE AT CONFERENCE, SISCO TOLD BOTH ENVOYS THAT IT WAS PROBABLY TOO EARLY TO DESCRIBE THIS DEFINITIVELY, ALTHOUGH THEY HAD BEEN COOPERATIVE IN PROCEDURAL PHRASE.

want to give you a brief report on the six and one half hour conversation                        I had with President AsadSee Document 393We discussed the date of the opening of the conference and he has no                        objection to a postponement to the 21st After a rather detailed discussion                        on the content of the draft USUSSR                        letter to the Secretary General President Asad said that he is prepared to go along with any                        formulation which is acceptable to youI discussed with him frankly the difficulties which Israel is finding with                        the draft letter and in particular to the reference to the Palestinians in                        the letter I discussed with President Asad the following reformulation of the last sentence in                        paragraph 2 which I hope you will find acceptable It would read The                        parties have also agreed that the question of other participants from the                        Middle East area will be discussed during the first stage of the                        conference If you agree to this revision I will make a major effort in                        Israel on SundayDecember 16 to get its                        approvalHowever I regret to report that I learned for the first time that President                            Asad is very hesitant about                        coming to the conference unless there is prior agreement on the precise line                        of disengagement in the Golan Heights I frankly told President Asad that in my judgment it would be a serious mistake if he decided                        not to participate in the conference I pointed out that getting agreement                        on a specific line of disengagement before the conference would be                        impossible I explained that for example there had been no military                        representative talks between the Syrians and Israelis as there have been                        between your representatives and those of Israel Without some prior                        indication of the position of both sides as was the case in the discussions                        of the EgyptianIsraeli military representatives I could not be expected                        before the 21st to produce such an agreement and that I would not promise                        what I could not produce I did state to President Asad my firm belief that once the                        conference is convened and a SyrianIsraeli subgroup is formed that it                        would be possible for me to make a major effort in the month of January with                        a view to achieving a disengagement agreement on the SyrianIsraeli front as                        we hope and expect on the EgyptianIsraeli frontI hope that you will find a way to communicate with President Asad in light of the above report I hope                        you will urge him to attend the conference If the conference fails now all                        the momentum I have built up and all the hopes we have had will be                        dissipatedIf you agree with revised formulation in the letter given above I intend to                        ask the Soviets to have their Ambassador in Damascus present the draft                        letter to the Syrians and then they can decide how they will respond to the                        Secretary Generals invitation I intend also to ask the Soviets to urge an                        affirmative decision on the Syrians and I hope that you will do the                            sameIn telegram Secto 1416637 from Amman to Cairo

SUMMARY.  IF SARG CONFIRMS REPORT FROM QUASI- OFFICIAL SYRIAN ARAB NEWS AGENCY THAT IT HAS DECIDED NOT TO PARTICIPATE IN GENEVA CONFERENCE, WE BELIEVE THAT THERE WILL BE MUCH BETTER THAN EVEN CHANCE OF EARLY SYRIAN RESUMPTION OF HOSTILTITIES,  FOR WHICH DAMASCUS IS NOW VERY EXTENSIVELY PREPARED.  SYRIAN AIM WOULD BE MAINLY POLITICAL, VIZ, TO FORCE ISRAEL TO ENTER PEACE CONFERENCE UNDER LESS FAVORABLE TERMS THAN NOW ARRANGED, BUT FIGHTING WOULD ALSO PLEASE SYRIAN HAWKS AND EASE    SECRET  ASADS DOMESTIC STRAINS.  IF SYRIA, RESUMED, WE BELIEVE EGYPT WOULD BE DRAWN IN ALMOST IMMEDIATELY.  SOVIETS WOULD BE UNLIKELY TO WARN-DAMASCUS BEFOREHAND THAT THEY WOULD NOT AID SYRIA IN THE EVENT THAT THE RESUMED HOSTILITIES WENT BADLY; AND, EVEN IF SOVIETS SO WARNED, SYRIANS WOULD PROBABLY NOT CONSIDER SUCH A THREAT CREDIBLE.  END SUMMARY.\n2.  AS WE ASSESS SYRIAN SITUATION, REGIME IS SUSPICIOUS THAT CEASEFIRE AND GENEVA CONFERENCE UNDER PRESENT ARRANGEMENTS AND AGENDA ARE ELEMENTS OF AN AMERICAN- ISRAELI MANEUVER TO FRUSTRATE ARAB EFFORT TO REGAIN OCCUPIED TERRITORIES, AND THAT UNILATERAL EGYPTIAN   ACCEPTANCE OF CEASEFIRE, EXCHANGE OF POWS WITHOUT DISENGAGEMENT, AND WILLINGNESS TO GO TO GENEVA SUGGEST EGYPTIAN READINESS TO CONCLUDE SEPARATE AGREEMENT WITH ISRAEL WITHOUT REGARD TO SYRIAN INTERESTS.  SYRIANS SEEM TO BELIEVE THAT THEIR ARMED FORCE  WERE NOT DEFEATED, LEARNED VALUABLE LESSONS IN OCTOBER, HAVE BEEN ADEQUATELY RESUPPLIED, AND NOW HAVE CAPABILIY TO INFLICT MORE DAMAGE IN ANOTHER ROUND.  ISRAELI REFUS*  TO COMPLY WITH CURRENT SYRIAN DEMANDS  BEARING  ON POSITION OF ISRAELIS IN OCCUPIED SYRIAN TERRITORIES HAS REINFORCED SYRIAN DISTRUST OF US WILLINGNES* TO ""DELIVER"" ISRA*L AT GENEVA AND *URTURED BELIEF THAT MILITARY OPTION MUST B *PURSUED UNTIL US HAS LEARNED THAT SYRIAN:DESIDERAT* CANNOT BE IGNORED.\n3.  ALTHOUGH WE HAVE NO REASON TO DOUBT SADATS GENUINE DESIRE FOR SUCCESS OF CONFERENCE, HE HAS SOME HAWKISH SENTIMENT TO CONTEND WITH IN HIS OWN ARMY, AND IN ANY CASE HE PROBABLY HAS VERY LITTLE LEVERAGE ON ASAD. IF MAJOR HOSTILITIES BREAK OUT ON GOLAN FRONT, WE SEE ALMOST NO POSSIBILITY THAT SUEZ FRONT COULD BE KEPT QUIET.  EGYPT WOULD BE SORELY TEMPTED TO SEEK TO EXPLOIT ISRAELI PREOCCUPATION WITH GOLAN FRONT, AND, IN FACT, IF SADAT CONCLUDES THAT ASADS DECISION TO GO TO WAR IS IRREVERSIBLE, HE MAY WELL RELUCTANTLY\n4.  SYRIAN INSISTENCE ON PRE-GENEVA COMPLIANCE BY ISRAEL WITH SYRIAN DISENGAGEMENT DEMANDS MAY MEAN THAT SYRIA IS OPPOSED ON PRINCIPLE TO PARTICIPATION IN ANY PEACE CONFERENCE WHOSE OUTCOME IS NOT PRE- DETERMINED IN ARAB FAVOR. BAATIST DOGMA AND PALISTINENIAN ASSOCIATIONS MAY HAVE LED REGIME TO PLAY ITS TRADITIONAL SPOILERS ROLE AND TO TRY TO SCUTTLE THE NEGOTIATING APPROACH .  OBJECT WOULD BE TO FORCE     ISRAEL TO CONFERENCE TABLE, AFTER NEW BATTLES, UNDER     MUCH GREATER INTERNATIONAL PRESSURE TO COMMIT ITSELF IN     ADVANCE TO WITHDRAW FROM VIRTUALLY ALL THE OCCUPIED     TERRITORIES.\n5.  SOVIETS HAVE BEEN URGING SYRIA TO GO TO GENEVA, PROBABLY ON ASSURANCE OF FIRM SOVIET SUPPORT FOR THEIR OBJECTIVES.  WE DOUBT, HOWEVER, THAT SOVIETS WOULD GO FURTHER TO WARN SYRIANS BEFOREHAND THAT RESORT TO WAR NOW WOULD ENTAIL LOSS OF SOVIET SUPPORT MILITARY SUPPORT EVEN IN EVENT SYRIANS FACED MAJOR DEFEAT. IF MOSCOW UNEXPECTEDLY TRIED SUCH A LINE, DAMASCUS WOULD PROBABLY JUDGE THAT SOVIETS ARE TOO DEEPLY COMMITTED TO ARABS TO CARRY OUT THREAT AND TO ABANDON THEIR PROTEGES IN TIME OF NEED, WITH CONSEQUENT GREAT DAMAGE TO SOVIET POSITION THROUGHOUT AREA.  \n6.  IN THESE CIRCUMSTANCES, RELATIVELY LITTLE OUTSIDE LEVERAGE IS AVAILABLE TO DISSUADE SYRIAN LEADERSHIP FROM ATTACK, IF THAT IS ITS INCLINAION, AS WE BELIEVE IT VERY PROBABLY IS.  INTERNALLY THE PRESSURES IN DAMASCUS ALL POINT TO RESUMED HOSTILITIES AS THE BEST OPTION TO ACHIEVE REGIME OBJECTIVES, BOTH AGAINST ISRAEL AND DOMESTIC RIVALS.  NUMEROUS REPORTS ATTEST    SECRET  TO THOROUGHGOING PREPARATIONS DURING LAST TEN DAYS FOR NEW BATTLE, AND WE BELIEVE ASAD WOULD WANT TO ACT BEFORE GENEVA CONFERENCE HAS ACTUALLY STARTED, SINCE HIS ABILI*Y TO DISRUPT PROCEEDINGS IS PROBABLY NOW AT MAXIMUM.  PRETEXT FOR NEW FIGHTING WILL NOT BE HARD TO MANUFACTURE, AND MOST OF ARAB WORLD IN ITS PRESENT MOOD WILL ACCEPT IT AS TRUE *  \n7.  MORE DETAILED CIA-DIA-INR REVIEW OF ARAB AND ISRAELI MILITARY CAPABILITIES AND POSSIBLE BATTLEFIELD SCENARIOS WILL BE SENT TOSEC DECEMBER 19.  RUSH\n",681094

ASSISTANT SECRETARY SISCO BRIEFED FRENCH AMBASSADOR FERNAND- LAURANT AND BRITISH AMBASSADOR HILDGARD SEPARATELY DEC. 22 SHORTLY BEFORE SECRETARY AND PARTY EMPLANED FOR HOME.  SISCO SAID SECRETARY REGRETTED NOT BEING ABLE TO DO THIS HIMSELF    SECRET  BUT PRESS OF BUSINESS PREVENTED IT.\n2. SISCO SAID CONFERENCE WENT PRETTY MUCH AS PLANNED AND AS WE EXPECTED. WE WERE DISAPPOINTED THAT THE SYRIANS DID NOT CHOOSE TO PARTICIPATE, BUT ON OTHER HAND THEIR ABSENCE PROBABLY  IMPROVED PROSPECT THAT CONFERENCE COULD FOCUS ON IMMEDIATE PROBLEMS THAT NEED TO BE SOLVED. IN THE FIRST DAYS PUBLIC SESSION, SPEECHES WERE OBVIOUSLY MAINLY FOR HOME CONSUMPTION. SISCO COMMENTED THAT OVERALL ATMOSPHERE HAD BEEN SOMETHING LESS THAN REAL WARMTH. ON PART OF EGYPTIANS IN PARTICULAR, ESPECIALLY GIVEN SYRIAN DECISION STAY AWAY, THERE HAD BEEN CONTINUING CONCERN AND WARINESS ABOUT VISIBLE CONTACT WITH ISRAELIS (SISCO DESCRIBED MINOR CONTRETEMPS ABOUT SEATING ARRANGEMENTS WHICH FORTUNATELY HAD BEEN QUICKLY RESOLVED). HOWEVER, ARABA AS AWELL AS ISRAELIS SEEMED TO REALIZE OPENING OF CONFERENCE WAS HISTORIC MOMENT AND PRESENTED OPPORTUNITY WHICH MUST NOT BE LOST.\n3. SISCO SAID MOST IMPORTANT RESULT OF CONFERENCE HAD BEEN REAL CONSENSUS THAT WAS ACHIEVED ON PLAN FOR ONGOING WORK OF CONFERENCE. AS CONSENSUS STATEMENT READ BY SYG INDICATED, THERE HAD BEEN AGREEMENT THAT CONFERENCE WOULD STAY IN SESSION,  AND THAT REPRESENTATIVES OF THE PARTICIPANTS WOULD REMAIN AVAILABLE AND IN TOUCH AT LEAST AT AMBASSADORIAL LEVEL. EGYPT- ISRAELI WORKING GROUP WOULD BE SET UP TO CONTINUE DISCUSSIONS ON DISENGAGEMENT AND SEPARATION OF FORCES. THIS WOULD BEGIN SOMETIME NEXT WEEK, AND  WOULD NOT WAIT FOR ISRAELI ELECTIONS. ALL THESE ARRANGEMENTS HAD BEEN WELL PREPARED IN ADVANCE IN PRIVATE DISCUSSIONS LAST EVENING AND THIS MORNING, SO THAT CONFERENCE WAS ABLE TO MEET THIS MORNING, WITH ALL THIS BUTTONED DOWN.\n4. BOTH BRITISH AND FRENCH AMBASSADORS ASKED IF SISCO FORESAW WORKING GROUP TALKS PROCEEDING ON SAME PATTERN AS KILOMETER\n5. BOTH BRITISH AND FRENCH ASKED WHETHER ANY WORK MIGHT BE  DONE ON OTHER ASPECTS WHILE EGYPT/ISRAELI DISENGAGEMENT TALKS UNDERWAY. SISCO SAID DOOR HAD BEEN LEFT OPEN FOR THIS, BUT THAT IT WOULD PROBABLY BE PREMATURE NOW. WE OURSELVES DID NOT PRESS  FOR ANYTHING LIKE THIS BECAUSE WE BELIEVE FIRMLY THAT STEP- BY-STEP APPROACH WAS BEST, AND ONCE CONCRETE PROGRESS HAD BEEN ACHIEVED ON GROUND, PSYCHOLOGICAL ATMOSPHERE OF CONFERENCE WOULD CHANGE, MAKING PROGRESS ON OTHER ISSUES MORE FEASIBLE. BRITISH ASKED WHETHER THIS HELD TRUE OF ISRAELI/JORDAN DISCUSSION AS WELL, AND SISCO REPLIED THAT ALTHOUGH WE HOPE SOMETHING WOULD GET STATTEDON JORDAN FRONT AS WELL, WOULD PROBABLY LAG SOMEWHAT BEHIND THE START OF EGYPT/ISRAELI TALKS.\n6. BOTH BRITISH AND FRENCH ASKED OUR ASSESSMENT OF SYRIA VIS-A-VIS CONFERENCE. SISCO SAID THAT OUR JUDGMENT WAS SYRIAN POSTURE WAS ONE OF WATCHFUL WAITING. DOOR HAD BEEN LEFT OPEN FOR THEM, AND OUR JUDGMENT WAS IF SOLID PROGRESS COULD BE MADE ON EGYPTIAN/ISRAELI DISENGAGEMENT, SYRIANS WOULD WANT TO COME IN AT SUBSEQUENT STAGE. ON QUESTION SOVIET ATTITUDE AT CONFERENCE, SISCO TOLD BOTH ENVOYS THAT IT WAS PROBABLY TOO EARLY TO DESCRIBE THIS DEFINITIVELY, ALTHOUGH THEY HAD BEEN COOPERATIVE IN PROCEDURAL PHRASE.

other colleaguesSee                                Documents 398 and 399 Mrs Meir                        called Cabinet into session at 1:00 am MondayDecember 17 and Cabinet approved action described below2 Please tell Dobrynin immediately                        that the Israelis have agreed to the text of the letter in paragraph 5                        below to which President Sadat had                        previously agreed3 Please ask Dobrynin to have the                        Soviet Ambassador in Syria present the letter to the Syrian Government and                        seek Syrian agreement December 17 Remind Dobrynin that Asad                        told me that any text agreeable to Sadat would be agreeable to him4 In addition please point out to Dobrynin that Brezhnev gave us his word of honor that the prisoners would                        be released shortly after the ceasefireSee                                Documents 221 and 222 If Soviet promises are to mean anything it is                        essential that the Syrians produce a list of prisoners by the opening of the                        conference If this is not done we cannot guarantee that Israel will stay                        at the conferenceIn telegram Secto 173 to Beirut for Buffum December 17 Kissinger instructed the Ambassador to                            give Assad an oral message that stated that Israel had agreed to a                            slightly modified version of the draft letter to the Secretary General                            and that advised him that it was in Syrias interest to attend the                            conference Kissinger added that                            based on his talks with the Israelis he believed there were good                            prospects for progress on disengagement on the SyrianIsraeli front The                            Secretary emphasized however that although Israel was prepared to                            engage in serious and concrete discussions on disengagement of forces                            with Syria at Geneva it could not do so unless Syria provided a list of                            POWs and permitted a visit by the Red Cross National Archives                                Nixon Presidential                            Materials NSC Files Box 1179                                Harold

USUSSR letter                        to Waldheim now reads as follows:Begin textDear Mr Secretary General:On October 22 1973 the Security Council adopted Resolution 338 jointly                        sponsored by the Soviet Union and the United States which calls for negotiations to start between the                        parties concerned under appropriate auspices aimed at establishing a just                        and durable peace in the Middle East The Soviet Union and the United States                        have now been informed by the parties concerned of their readiness to                        participate in the peace conference The convening of the conference should                        be under the auspices of the United NationsIt is our understanding that Egypt Israel Jordan and Syria have agreed to                        participate from the outset in the conference which would begin in Geneva on                        December 21 The parties have agreed that the conference should be under the                        cochairmanship of the Soviet Union and the United States The parties have                        also agreed that the question of other participants from the Middle East                        area will be discussed during the first stage of the conferenceIt is our hope that you will find it possible to participate in the opening                        phase of the conference at which it is expected that the governments                        concerned will be represented by their respective Foreign Ministers and                        later by their specially appointed representatives with Ambassadorial rank                        We also hope that you can make available a representative who would keep you                        fully informed as the conference proceeds Finally we would also appreciate                        it if the United Nations could make appropriate arrangements for the                        necessary conference facilitiesIf as we hope you find it possible to participate as cochairmen the Soviet                        Union and the US would appreciate it if you would agree to serve as                        convener of the conference and preside in the opening phaseWe request that you circulate this letter to members of the Security Council                        for their information We believe it would be appropriate for the President                        of the Security Council to consult informally with the membership with a                        view to securing a favorable consensus of the Council End                            text6 You should call Dobrynins                        attention to the minor change from the previous draft of the final sentence                        of the first paragraph of the letter Whereas it used to read: The                        conference should be convened under the auspices of the United Nations it                        now reads: The convening of the conference should be under the auspices of                        the United Nations Should the Soviets object to this change tell                            Dobrynin we will go back

Minister Rifai who said that it was                            quite clear from their earlier discussion that Jordan would agree to any                            text acceptable to the Secretary but

THERE FOLLOWS VERBATIME ADVANCE TEXT (UNNECESSARY WORDS OMITTED) OF PRIMIN MEIRS SPEECH DEC 20 BEFORE KNESSET, EXCEPT FOR FIRT THREE PARAGRAPHS WHICH WE HAVE SUMMARIZED.\n2. AFTER ENTAILING VIRTUES OF CEASEFIRE STABILIAZTION AGREEMENT OF NOV 11 AND KM 101 TALKS, MRS MEIR CONTINUED: BEGIN TEXT. THE TALKS HAVE BEEN BROKEN OFF, TO OUR GREAT REGRET, BUT NEED TO STABILIZE CEASEFIRE BY SEPARATION OF FORCES REMAINED. WE EXPRESSED OUR READINESS TO RESUME DISCUSSION OF SUBJECT WHEN PEACE CONFERENCE CONVENES, IN HOPE OF REACHING AN AGREE- MENT. BREAKING- OFF OF TALKS AT KM 101 ON EGYPTS INITIATIVE MADE IT NECESSARY TO EXERCISE REDOUBLED ALERTNESS IN MILITARY AREA, IN VIEW OF POSSIBILITY OF AGRESSIVE MOVES ON PART OF EGYPT. UNCLASSIFIED 3. REGRETTABLY DESPITE EGYPTIAN GOVERNMENTS COMMITMENT TO CEASEFIRE, BREACHES OF CEASEFIRE OCCUR ALMOST EVERY DAY THROUGH FIRE FROM EGYPTIAN ARMY POSITIONS TOWARDS OUR FORCES. HUNDREDS OF SUCH INCIDENTS HAVE TAKEN PLACE SINCE OCT 24, AND THER HAVE EVEN BEEN CASUALTIES. ON THIS OCCASION, I CALL UPON EGYPTIAN AUTHORITIES TO COMPLY WITH THEIR OBLIGATION TO OBSERVE CEASEFIRE-- TO PUT SAFETY-CATCH ON THEIR ARMS.\n4. ALL THIS TIME, US SECRETARY OF STATE KISSINGER, HAS BEEN CONTINUING HIS EFFORTS TO GET AGREEMENT FROM PARTIES CONCERNED TO TAKE PART IN PEACE CONFERENCE BETWEEN OURSELVES AND OUR NEIGHBORS. IN COURSE OF HIS EFFORTS, HE HAS VISITED ARAB CAPITALS AND CAPITAL OF ISRAEL. IN OUR TALKS IN JERUSALEM, FOLLOW- ING UPON MY TALKS WITH HIM IN WASHINGTON, I DISCUSSED WITH SECRETARY OF STATE IMPORTANH ISSURES IN CONNECTION WITH CONFERENCE. QUESTION OF AUSPICES FOR CONFERENCE, STATES WHOSE REPRESENTATIVES WOULD BE INVITED, STAGES OF DISCUSSIONS, AND SO FORTH, WERE DISCUSSED. WE ALSO HELD DETAILED DISCUSSION ON QUESTION OF SEPARATION OF FORCES, AND ISSUE WHICH DR KISSINGER WISHED TO STUDY THOROUGHLY IN CONTACTS WITH AUTHORITIES OF EGYPT AND ISRAEL. THIS DISCUSSION HAS NOT YET BEEN COMPLETED.\n5. SPONSORS OF CONFERENCE--UNITED STATES AND SOVIET UNION-- HAD INTENDED TO CONVENE IT ON DEC 18, BUT THEY HAD TO COMMUNI- CATE WITH GOVERNMENTS CONCERNING THEIR LETTER TO UN SECRETARY GENERAL, WHO IS CONVENING CONFERENCE. AS A RESULT OF THESE DISCUSSIONS WITH THE PARTIES--ISRAEL INCLUDED--THERE WAS A POSTPONEMENT. IN LETER FROM US AND USSR TO UN SECRETARY GENERAL, DATED DEC 18, 1973, WHICH WAS COMPOSED FOLLOWING DELIBERATIONS WITH THE PARTIES, IT IS STATED: (VERBATIM TEXT OF SYGS LETTER OF INVITATION AS CONTAINED USUN 5704 FOLLOWS.)\n6. US SECRETARY OF STATE ATTACHED SUPREME IMPORTANCE TO OPENING CONFERENCE WITHIN MONTH OF DECEMBER. IT APPEARS TO ME THAT HE WAS ANXIOUS OVER POSSIBILITY OF ANY POSTPONEMENT, LEST OBSTACLES CROPPED UP AND POSSIBLY EVEN FIRING WAS RESUMED. WE TOO, FOR OUR PART, WERE NOT INTERESTED INDELAYS OR POSTPONE- MENTS FOR VERY SAME REASONS. OUR FORCES ARE DEPLOYED AGAINST ANY AGGRESSIVE INITIATIVE BY EGYPT OR SYRIA, BUT WE DO NOT WANT RESUMPTION OF WAR. UNCLASSIFIED 7. ISRAEL AGREEMENT WAS, THEREFORE, GIVEN TO OPENING OF CONFERENCE IN DECEMBER, PROVIDED SUBSTATIVE DISCUSSIONS ON VARIOUS ASPECTS OF SUBJECT OF PEACE ARE HELD AT LATER DATE, AFTER ELECTIONS TO EIGHT KNESSET, AND ARE CONDUCTED ON RESPONSIBILITY OF A CABINET WHICH SHALL HAVE RECEIVED CONFIDENCE OF NEW KNESSET. I AM HAPPY TO NOTE THAT THIS CONDI- TION OF OURS HAS BEEN ACCEPTED. CONFERENCE WILL OPEN TOMORROW, FRIDAY, DEC 21, 1973, BEFORE KNESSET ELECTIONS, BUT INITIAL STAGE WILL BE BRIEF AND FORMAL ONLY AND WILL LAST TWO DAYS. AT OPENING CEREMONY, ADDRESSES WILL BE DELIVERED BY FOREIGN MINISTERS OF INVITED STATES, AS WELL AS FOREIGN MINISTERS OF UNITED STATES AND SOVIET UNION AND SECRETARY GENERAL OF UNITED NATIONS. THERE WILL BE AN INTERVAL THEREAFTER, AND CONFERENCE WILL BE RESUMED IN COURSE OF JANUARY.\n8. AS AFORSAID, CONFERENCE STARTS TOMORROW, AND MUCH TO OUR REGRET, DESPITE ALL OUR EFFORTS TO ENSURE THAT THERE WILL BE NO SESSIONS ON SABBATH, NO WAY WAS FOUND TO CHANGE TIMING DETERMINED, AND IT WILL INDEED CONTINUE ALSO ON SATURDAY, DEC 22, 1973.\n9. OPENING STAGE WILL LAST ONLY TWO DAYS, BUT DURING THIS SHORT PERIOD ARRANGEMENTS AND PROCEDURES WILL BE DETERMINED WHICH WILL INFLUENCE ENTIRE COURSE OF CONFERENCE, AND IT DOES NOT APPEAR FEASIBLE TO ME THAT WE CAN AFFORD TO BE ABSENT FROM HALF THE TIME OF DISCUSSIONS. MINISTER FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS ANNOUNCED AT CABINET SESSION THAT ISRAELS REPRESENTATIVES WHO WILL BE COMPELLED-- IN THIS GIVEN SITUATION-TO PARTICIPATE IN DISCUSSIONS ON SATURDAY, WILL, OF COURS, SCRUPULOUSLY REFRAIN FROM DESE- CRATING SABBATH.\n0. ALMOST CERTAINLY, FIRST MATTER TO BE DEALT WITH BY CONFERENCE IN JANUARY 1974 WILL BE DISENGAGEMENT OF FORCES, WHICH IS PART OF CEASEFIRE AGREEMENT (ARTICLE 2 OF SIX-POINT AGREEMENT). I HAVE NOTED THAT PRESIDENT SADAT HAS SAID PUBLICLY THAT HE ALSO IS PREPARED TO MAKE PROGRESS IN DISCUSSIONS ON THIS SUBJECT, AND WE SHALL BE PREPARED TO TAKE PART IN THESE DISCUSSIONS EVEN BEFORE NEW GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN FORMED. AS I HAVE SAID, PRINCI- PAL STAGE OF CONFERENCE WILL BEGIN AND CONTINUE ACCORDING TO DIRECTIVES OF NEW GOVERNMENT. UNCLASSIFIED UNCLASSIFIED\n1. IN ORAL AND WRITTEN CONTACTS WITH PRESIDENT OF UNITED STATES, MR RICHARD NIXON, AND SECRETARY OF STATE, DR KISSINGER, MAIN CONDITIONS AND POLITICAL FRAMEWORK FOR CONVENING OF CONFERENCE HAVE BEEN THOROUGHLY CLARIFIED. IN COURSE OF THESE CONTACTS, WE HAVE AGREED TO DEFINITION OF FUNCTION OF UNITED NATIONS. FUNCTION ALLOTTED TO UN HAS BEEN THOROUGHLY CLARIFIED: AUSPICES OF UN ARE LIMITED TO CONVENING OF CONFERENCE. UN SECRETARY GENERAL, DR WALDHEIM, WILL SERVE AS CONVENER OF CONFERENCE AND CHAIRMAN AT ITS OPENING SESSION. UN SECRETARY GENERAL DISPATCHED INVITATIONS AT REQUEST OF US AND USSR, IN THEIR LETTER WHICH I HAVE ALREADY MENTIONED. HE WILL ENSURE THAT UN ORGANIZATION WILL PLACE AT DISPOSAL OF CONFERENCE SERVICES REQUIRED FOR EFFECTIVE WORKING.\n2. ON DEC 15, SECURITY COUNCIL ADOPTED DISTURBING RESOLU- TION IN REFERENCE TO PEACE CONFERENCE. FOUR OF PERMANENT MEMBERS, INCLUDING US AND USSR, ABSTAINED. LET US RECALL THAT ISRAEL HAS NO DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS WITH FIVE OUT OF TEN STATES THAT VOTED FOR RESOLUTION. I MUST MAKE IT CLEAR THAT ANY ATTEMPT TO INCLUDE SUB- JECTS OF DISCUSSIONS AT PEACE CONFERENCE WITHIN ACTIVITY AND AUTHORITY OF SECURITY COUNCIL WILL BE IN DANGEROUS CONTRADICTION TO BASIS AND PURPOSE OF CONFERENCE, AND WILL MEET WITH EXPLICIT UNCLASSIFIED OPPOSITION ON OUR PART. IT IS INCONCEIVABLE THAT US SHOULD ACQUIESCE IN SUCH A BREACH OF AGREED ASSUMPTIONS. WE SHALL NOT FIND OURSELVES ISOLATED IN FACING SUCH A DANGEROUS MOVE, WHICH VIOLATES CONSENT WHICH IS BASIS OF PEACE CONFERENCE.\n3. ARAB STATES WHICH HAVE BEEN INVITED TO TAKE PART IN CONFERENCE ARE EGYPT, JORDAN AND SYRIA, LEBANON HAS NOT YET BEEN INVITED, BUT I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT IT WILL BE INVITED AT LATER STAGE. EGYPT AND JORDAN HAVE ACCEPTED INVITATION, WHILE SYRIA HAS REPLIED IN NEGATIVE.\n4. WITH GREAT REGRET I HAVE TO INFORM HOUSE THAT SYRIAN RULERS STILL REPLY WITH FLAT REFUSAL TO OUR DEMAND FOR LIBERATION OF OUR PRISONERS. ON OUR PART PROPOSALS HAVE BEEN MADE TO THEM WHICH ARE BEYOND LIMITS OF OUR COMMITMENTS-- BUT IN VAIN. INFLUENTIAL POLITICAL ELEMENTS HAVE REPEATEDLY APPEALED TO SYRIAN RULERS--WITHOUT EFFECT. PRESIDENT OF SYRIA, WHO WAS ASKED TO DISCUSS SUBJECT OF PRISONERS, STATED THAT FROM HUMANITARIAN ASPECT THIS WAS NOT SUBJECT REQUIRING PARTICULAR DISCUSSION. AND NOW SYRIANS HAVE DECLARED THAT THEY WILL NOT BE COMING TO GENEVA.\n5. I DO NOT KNOW HOW SYRIANS EXPLAIN THEIR REFUSAL TO TAKE PART IN PEACE CONFERENCE. EVEN BEFORE THEY CAME OUT WITH THIS STATEMENT WE MADE IT CLEAR- BOTH FROM KNESSET ROSTRUM AND TO REPRESENTATIVES OF US- THAT AS LONG AS NO LIST OF OUR PRISONERS IS RECEIVED BY US AND RED CROSS IS NOT PERMITTED TO VISIT THEM, WE CANNOT SIT DOWN WITH THEM AT GENEVA CONFERENCE AT ANY STAGE.\n6. WE TRIED  TO MAKE CONTACT WITH SYRIANS THROUGH REPRESENTA- TIVES OF US AND OF REDCROSS. THROUGH US REPRESENTATIVE WE LEARNED OF SYRIAN PROPSOAL THAT WE AGREE TO RETURN OF 15,000 SYRIAN CITIZENS TO AREAS CAPTURED BY IDF IN YOM KIPPUR WAR, AND TO RETURN TWO SYRIAN POSITONS ON MT. HERMON. IF WE COMPLIED THERE WOULD BE AN EXCHANGE OF PRISONERS. WE AGREED TO RETURN OF CIVILIANS AND TO STATIONING OF UN FORCES IN TWO POSITIONS REFERRED TO. WHAT IS MORE, IN MY TALK WITH DR. GUYER, ASSISTANT SECRETARY-GENERAL OF UN, I PROPOSED THAT MEETING BETWEEN SENIOR ISRAELI AND SYRIAN OFFICERS BE HELD, SIMILAR TO KILOMETER 101. WE DIDNOT UNCLASSIFIED RECEIVE ANY AFFIRMATIVE REPLY.\n7. I REALIZE AND UNDERSTAND WHAT MUST BE FEELINGS OF FAMILIES WHOSE DEAR ONES HAVE BEEN TAKEN PRISONER BY SYRIANS. ALL OF US ARE AGHAST AT DREADFUL NEWS AND RUMOURS WHICH HAVE REACHED US. WE SHALL NOT CEASE IN OUR EFFORTS TO SECURE INTER- VENTION OF FACTORS WHICH CAN SPEED UP LIBERATION OF OUR SOLDIERS. SYRIAN RULERS ARE ASSUMING TERRIBLE RESPONSIBILITY, AND WE WILL NOT EXEMPT THEM FROM THIS RESPONSIBILITY.\n8. NEGOTIATIONS ON PEACE IN MIDDLE EAST MUST BE CONDUCTED BETWEEN STATES CONCERNED: NAMELY, BETWEEN ISRAEL ON ONE HAND AND ISRAELS NEIGHBOURS-EGYPT, JORDAN, SYRIA AND LEBANON- ON THE OTHER. THERE IS NO REASON TO INVITE TO PARTICIPATE IN THESE NEGOTIATIONS ANY ADDITIONAL STATES BESIDES US AND USSR, WHICH UNDERTOOK SPONSORSHIP OF CONFERENCE. THERE IS NO CONCEIVABLE OBJECTIVE CRITERION BY WHICH ADDITIONAL STATES SHOULD BE INVITED. WE ARE AWARE OF FACT THAT REPRESENTATIVES OF VARIOUS STATES HAVE EXPRESSED THEIR WISH TO TAKE PART IN CONFERENCE. THIS INCLUDES STATES NOT OUTSTANDING IN THEIR NEUTRALITY. ISRAEL GOVENMENT HAS EXPRESSED ITS OPPOSITION TO INVITATION OF ADDITIONAL STATES OR OF NON-SOVEREIGN FACTORS, AND WE ARE CONVINCED THAT BY THIS OPPOSITION WE ARE SAFEGUARDING CONFERENCE AGAINST DANGEROUS COMPLICATIONS.\n9. IT IS ONLY NATURAL THAT WE SHOULD HAVE VOICED OUR EXPLICIT OPPOSITION TO ANY NOTION OF INVITING TERRORIST ORGANIZATIONS UNDER THE AEGIS OF PLO OR ANY OTHER ORGANIZATION, AT ANY STAGE WHATSOEVER. IT IS INCONCEIVABLE THAT WE SHOULD AGREE TO TAKE PART IN CONFERENCE TO WHICH REPRESENTATIVES OF THESE ORGANIZATIONS SHOULD BE INVITED, NOT TO SPEEK OF NEGOTIATING WITH REPRESENTATIVES OF ORGANIZATIONS WHOSE DECLARED AIM IS DESTRUCTION OF STATE OF ISREL. WE HAVE NO COMMON DENOMINATOR WITH ORGANIZATINS THAT ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR ACTS OF TERRORISM AND MURDER. WE SHALL NEGOTIATE WITH REPRESENTATIVES OF NEIGHBOURING STATES, WITH WHICH WE HAVE CEASE-FIRE AGREEMENTS.\n0. WE ARE NOT IGNORING DISTURBING FACT THAT ONE OF POWERS UNDER WHOSE AUSPICES CONFERENCE IS MEETING HAS SEVERED DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS WITH ISRAEL. THIS POWER PLAYED CONSIDERABLE PART IN DEVELOPING ARAB MILITARY STRENGTH AND IN PREPARING EGYPT AND SYRIA FOR WAR.IN COURSE OF CONFERENCE, IT WILL BECOME CLEAR WHETHER THIS POWER IS ACUALLY CONDUCTING ITSELF IN MANNER FITTING TO AIM OF PEACE CONFERENCE.\n1. I AM CONVINCED THAT POLICY OF US AT PEACE CONFERENCE WILL BE GUIDED BY SONCERE GOODWILL AND WILL BE DESIGNED TO OFFER AID TO PARTIES, AS REQUIRED,D IN ORDER TO BRING ABOUT SUCCESSFUL CONCLUSION OF NEGOTIATIONS AND ACHIEVE CONTRACTUAL AND BINDING PEACE TREATY.\n2. ROLE FULFILLED BY US SINCE OCTOBER 6 AND UNTIRING EFFORTS OF SECRETARY OF STATE KISSINGER IN CAIRO, AMMAN AND OTHER ARAB CAPITALS HAVE BEEN OF NO SMALL ASSISTANCE TO CESSATION OF HOSTILITIES AND TO ACHIEVEMENT OF SIX-POINT AGREEMENT REPRESENTING LOGICAL AND OPERATIONAL CONTINUATION OF THE SECURITY COUNCILS CEASE-FIRE RESOLUTION. WE ARE ENCOURAGED BY CLEAR-CUT STAND OF US, AS FREQUENTLY EXPRESSED IN PUBLIC, IN FAVOUR OF DIRECT NEGOTIATIONS BETWEEN PARTIES. UNCLASSIFIED WITH HELP OF THIS CLEAR-CUT POLICY, WE HOPE TO ACHIEVE SIGNIFICANT AND DIRECT NEGOTIATIONS WITH EACH OF ARAB STAES BORDERING UPON ISRAEL, AND TO ADVANCE TOWARDS SETTLEMENT OF QUESTIONS IN DISPUTE.\n3. WE ATTACH SUPREME IMPORANCE TO WHAT IS STATED IN SC RE 338 ON SUBJECT OF NEGOTIATIONS. THIS TIME THERE IS EXPLICIT REFERENCE TO NEGOTIATIONS BETWEEEN PARTIES: UP TO THAT POINT THERE HAD BEEN NO LACK OF ATTEMPTS AT MEDIATION, SPONSORSHIP AND GOOD MFFICES, ALL OF THEM WITHOUT DIRECT NEGOTIATIONS. ISRAEL WILL BE ON WATCH THAT NO MISINTERPRETATION SHALL ARISE ON THIS PMINT, WHICH IS POSITIVE AND SIGNIFICANT INNOVATION IN SECURITY COUNCIL RESOLUTION 338.\n4. GOVERNMENT OF ISRAEL WILL SEND IT AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVES TO PEACE CONFERENCE WITH CLEAR CUT DIRECTIVES TO MAKE EVERY EFFORT TO ADVANCE TOWARDS AND ATTAIN PEACE. SUBSTANTIVE DIRECTIVES WILL BE ISSURE BY NEW GOVERMENT, AND I DO NOT TAKE IT UPON MYSELF TO DEFINE NOW ITS ATTITUDES ON MAJOR POINTS AT ISSURE. HOWEVER, I HOPE AND BELIEVE THAT NEW GOVERN- MENT TO BE ESTABLISHED BY EIGHTH KNESSET AFTER ELECTIONS WILL EXPRESS OUR PEOPLES YEARNINGS OF PEACE WITHIN DEFENSIBLE BORDERS.\n5. ON THRESHHOLD OF CONFERENCE, I SHALL MAKE NO ATTEMPT TO EXAMINE ATTITUES OF GOVERNMENTS OF ARAB STATES. THERE WILL BE TIME FOR THIS IN COURSE OF DISCUSSIONS AT CONFERENCE. INFLU- ENCE OF ALGIERS CONFERENCE, ITS DELIBERATIONS AND RESOLUTIONS, CANNOT BUT GIVE RISE TO CONCERN. HOWEVER, WE SHALL NOT CEASE TO HOPE FOR A TURNING POINT, A NEW APPROACH, FOR THROWING OFF OF SHACKLES OF EXTREME ATTITUDES DEVOID OF ANY SENSE OF REALITY. I WOULD LIKE ARAB STATES TO PROCEED TO PEACE CONFERENCE IN SAME SPIRIT OF SINCERITY, IMBUSED WITH SAME INSPIRATIONS THAT ANIMATE PEOPLE AND GOVERNMENT OF ISRAEL- FOR THEN ROAD TO PEACE WILL BE SMOOTH IN BOTH DIRECTIONS.\n6. SEVENT KNESSET IS CONCLUDING ITS TERM OF OFFICE IN WAKE OF DIFFICULT TRIALS AND SIGNIFICANT VICTORY OF YOM KIPPUR WAR. PEACE CONFERENCE WILL BE OPENING WITH SEVENTH KNESSET NOT YET HAVING COMPLETED ITS TERM. UNCLASSIFIED NO EFFORT MUST BE SPARED TO ENABLE STATE OF ISRAEL-DURING TERM OF EIGHTH KNESSET TO REACH AN AGREEMENT ON SEPARATION OF FORCES AND, WHAT IS MORE, ACHIEVE CNETRAL OBJECTIVES OF OUR POLICY- A LATING PEACE. ONCE STAGE OF SUBSTANTIVE DISCUSSIONS IS REACHED, ISRAELS DELEGATES WILL STRIVE FOR CONTRA- TUAL PEACE BETWEEN PARTIES, WITH DEFENSIBLE BORDERS, AND IN ACCORDANCE WITH GUIDELINES WHICH, IN MY BELIEF, WILL BE EXPRESSED IN BASIC POLICY OF NEXT GOVERNMENT.\n7. ISRAELS PARTICIPATION IN TALKS IS NOT SUBJECT TO ANY PRIOR CONDITIONS. ISRAEL HAS NOT DEMANDED PRIOR ACCEPTANCE OF HER POSITIONS BY OTHER PARTIES, NOR IS SHE ACCEPT- ING BEFOREHAND CONDITIONS OF OTHER PARTIES, AS STATED BY THEM PUBLICLY AND OTHERWISE, BUT EACH SIDE WILL BE FREE TO SUBMIT ITS PROPOSALS ON THE SUBJECTS UNDER DISCUSSION.\n8. WE ARE AWARE OF DIFFICULTIES AND STRUGGLES AHEAD OF US. WE ARE ALERT TO DANGERS. NEVERTHELESS, ISRAELS EMISSARIES WILL GO TO PEACE CONFERENCE SOBERLY, WHOLEHEARTEDLY, AND COURAGEOUSLY. WE SHALL LET NO-ONE TAKE THE NAME OF PEACE IN VAIN. WE SHALL NOT CEASE TO STRIVE FOR A FULL PEACE-IN SIMPLE SENSE OF TERM-A PEACE TO END WARS, WHICH WILL OPEN UP BRIGHT PROSPECTS FOR UNDISTURBED DEVELOPEMTN OF A LIFE OF CREATIVE PROGRESS FOR EACH AND EVERY ONE OF PEOPLES AND STATES IN MIDDLE EAST.

              previously agreed3 Please ask Dobrynin to have the                        Soviet Ambassador in Syria present the letter to the Syrian Government and                        seek Syrian

conference should be under the                        cochairmanship of the Soviet Union and the United States The parties have                        also agreed that the question of other

WE AGREE IT WOULD BE DESIRABLE CONDUCT BRIEFING OF ALLIES ON MIDDLE EAST PRIOR TO DISCUSSIONS WITH SECRETARY AT NAC MINISTERIAL.  YOU SHOULD THEREFORE CALL MEETING OF NAC FOR DEC 5 FOR BRIEFING ALONG FOLLOWING LINES.        A.  STATUS OF CEASEFIRE.  WITH EGYPTIAN STATEMENT THAT IT WAS DISCONTINUING MILITARY REPRESENTATIVE TALKS AT KILO- METER 101, THERE WERE COUPLE OF DAYS OF INTENSIFIED BUT STILL MINOR ARMED INCIDENTS BETWEEN ISRAELIS AND EGYPTIANS, PROBABLY STEMMING MAINLY FROM NERVOUSNESS ON BOTH SIDES THAT CEASEFIRE MIGHT BREAK DOWN.  THERE IS SOME PROSPECT KILOMETER 101 TALKS WILL BE RESUMED, AND US IS WORKING TO THIS END. UN FORCE IS SLOWLY GETTING INTO PLACE BUT THE STRENGTH OF BOTH SIDES AND GENERAL NERVOUSNESS IS SUCH THAT CEASEFIRE WILL REQUIRE CAREFUL NURTURING.        B.  PEACE CONFERENCE PLANS.  IT LOOKS REASONABLY HOPE- FUL PEACE CONFERENCE WILL CONVENE AT GENEVA ABOUT DEC 18.    SECRET  WE CANNOT REPORT FORMAL APPROVAL OF PARTIES AS YET SINCE NUMBER OF DETAILS REMAIN TO BE WORKED OUT.  WE AND SOVIETS HAVE BEEN IN CLOSE TOUCH THROUGHOUT IN EFFORT TO WORK OUT DETAILS AND IN GENERAL SOVIET ATTITUDE HAS BEEN HELPFUL.   IN OUR VIEW MILREP TALKS HAVE BROKEN VALUABLE GROUND, WHICH SHOULD FACILITATE NEGOTIATIONS ON THIS ISSUE AT PEACE CONFERENCE.   C.  OIL EMBARGO.  WE HAVE NO NEW DECISIONS BY OIL PRO- DUCERS TO REPORT AT THIS TIME.  NEVERTHELESS WE BELIEVE ARAB GOVERNMENTS ARE WEIGHING WITH INCREASING SERIOUSNESS OUR STATEMENT THAT WE CANNOT PLAY ROLE THEY EXPECT US TO UNDER THREAT OF OIL EMBARGO.  WE ARE CONTINUING OUR DIS- CUSSIONS WITH THEM.   D.  ON THE SYRIAN FRONT WE HAD HOPED THAT EGYPTIAN-ISRAELI AGREEMEN ON POW EXCHANGE WOULD PROMOTE SIMILAR AGREEMENT WITH SYRIANS BUT AFTER SOME INITIAL EXCHANGES BETWEEN THE TWO IN EARLY NOVEMBER THERE HAS BEEN NO RECENT PROGRESS TO REPORT.   E.  SECRETARYS MIDDLE EAST TRIP.  SECRETARY IS PLANNING SECOND TRIP TO VARIOUS MIDDLE EAST CAPITALS BETWEEN HIS APPEARANCE AT NATO MINISTERIAL AND PROJECTED CONVENING OF PEACE CONFERENCE DEC 18.  MAIN PURPOSE IN ALL CAPITALS WILL BE TO DISCUSS ARRANGEMENTS FOR PEACE CONFERENCE AND EXCHANGE IDEAS AS TO HOW CONFERENCE CAN BEST FACILITATE NEGOTIATIONS BETWEEN PARTIES ON SUBSTANTIVE ISSUES.   F.  SECRETARY WILL OF COURSE BE PREPARED TO DISCUSS MIDDLE EAST DURING MINISTERIAL MEETING.  \n2.  IN YOUR CONSULTATIONS YOU SHOULD STRIKE A STRAIGHTFOR- WARD FACTUAL APPROACH AVOIDING ANY APPEALS TO THE EURO- PEANS TO COOPERATE.  THIS MEETING SHOULD BE A FACTUAL RUN- DOWN AS TO WHERE MATTERS ARE, AND YOU SHOULD TRY TO AVOID CHARACTERIZING THESE FACTS ONE WAY OR ANOTHER OR SPECULAT- ING ON THEM.  MAKING IT STRICTLY A FACTUAL PRESENTATION WILL MINIMIZE THE POSSIBILITY THAT ANY OF THE INFORMATION YOU PROVIDE CAN BE DISTORTED IN ARAB CAPITALS TO OUR    SECRET  DETRIMENT.  YOU SHOULD ALSO GET ACROSS POINT WE BELIEVE IT IS IMPORTANT INFORMATION CONVEYED BE HANDLED DISCREETLY AND IN CONFIDENTIAL MANNER.   KISSINGER\n",682302

below2 Please tell Dobrynin immediately                        that the Israelis have agreed to the text of the letter in paragraph 5                        below to which President Sadat had                        previously agreed3 Please ask Dobrynin to have the                        Soviet Ambassador in Syria present the letter to the Syrian Government and                        seek Syrian agreement December 17 Remind Dobrynin that Asad                        told me that any text agreeable to Sadat would be agreeable to him4 In addition please point out to Dobrynin that Brezhnev gave us his word of honor that the prisoners would                        be released shortly after the ceasefireSee                                Documents 221 and 222 If Soviet promises are to mean anything it is                        essential that the Syrians produce a list of prisoners by the opening of the                        conference If this is not done we cannot guarantee that Israel will stay                        at the conferenceIn telegram Secto 173 to Beirut for Buffum December 17 Kissinger instructed the Ambassador to                            give Assad an oral message that stated that Israel had agreed to a                            slightly modified version of the draft letter to the Secretary General                            and that advised him that it was in Syrias interest to attend the                            conference Kissinger added that                            based on his talks with the Israelis he believed there were good                            prospects for progress on disengagement on the SyrianIsraeli front The                            Secretary emphasized however that although Israel was prepared to                            engage in serious and concrete discussions on disengagement of forces                            with Syria at Geneva it could not do so unless Syria provided a list of                            POWs

                     and durable peace in the Middle East The Soviet Union and the United States                        have now been informed by the parties concerned of their readiness to                        participate in the peace conference The convening of the conference should                        be under the auspices of the United NationsIt is our understanding that Egypt Israel Jordan and Syria have agreed to                        participate from the outset in the conference which would begin in Geneva on                        December 21 The parties have agreed that the conference should be under the                        cochairmanship of the Soviet Union and the United States The parties have                        also agreed that the question of other participants from the Middle East                        area will be discussed during the first stage of the conferenceIt is our hope that you will find it possible to participate in the opening                        phase of the conference at which it is expected that the governments                        concerned will be represented by their respective Foreign Ministers and                        later by their specially appointed representatives with Ambassadorial rank                        We also hope that you can make available a representative who would keep you

conference facilitiesIf as we hope you find it possible to participate as cochairmen the Soviet                        Union and the US would appreciate it if you would agree to serve as                        convener of the conference and preside in the opening phaseWe request that you circulate this letter to members of the Security Council                        for their information We believe it would be appropriate for the President                        of the Security Council to consult informally with the membership with a                        view to securing a favorable consensus of the Council End                            text6 You should call Dobrynins                        attention to the minor change from the previous draft of the final sentence

FOLLOWING IS EMBASSY SUMMARY OF DEC 28 EBAN INTERVIEW CONDUCTED BY DAVAR CORRESPONDENTS TADMOR AND BLOCH ON GENEVA CONFERENCE AND IMPLICATIONS OF KNESSET ELECTION FOR MIDEAST PEACE PROSPECTS.\n2. US-SOVIET MIDEAST ROLE. EBAN SAID THAT AMERICANS AND SOVIETS ARE UNITED AS CO-CHAIRMEN BY THEIR DESIRE TO PREVENT MIDDLE EAST FROM REMAINING WAR AREA AND CAUSING DETERIORATING OF SUPERPOWERS RELATIONS. BOTH WANT TO DEFUSE DANGEROUS SITUATION CREATED BY UNCLASSIFIED  CLOSE PROXIMITY OF EGYPTIAN AND ISRAELI FORCES. WAR HAS TURNED CLOCK BACK ON DETENTE. ENERGY CRISIS ALSO HAS HAD MODERATING PSYCHOLOGICAL INFLUENCE ON GENEVA CONFERENCE.\n3. GENEVA CONFERENCE--OPENING PHASE. EBAN SAID THAT OPEING SESSION HAS CREATED UPRECEDENTED ATMOSPHERE OF EXPECTATION. SEVERE JUDG- MENT AWAITS WHOEVER WOULD BE RESPONSIBLE FOR FAILURE OF CONFERENCE. CONFERENCE HAS CREATED NEW FRAMEWORK FOR HANDLING MIDEAST CONFLICT BY LIMITING PARTICIPATION ONLY TO THOSE PARTIES DIRECTLY CONCERNED AND BY ADOPTION OF PRINCIPLE OF CONSENSUS. WHERAS IN SECURITY COUNCIL ARABS SOUGHT ADOPTION OF ANTI-ISRAELI DECISIONS, PARTIES AT GENEVA ARE SEEKING TO ARRIVE AT CONSENSUS, PROVIDING ISRAEL WITH MAXIMUM DEFENSE AGAINST COERCION.\n4. TIMING OF DISENGAGEMENT TALKS. EBAN SAID THAT DECISION TO START DISENGAGEMENT TALKS BEFORE JAN 1 WAS TAKEN IN CLOSED SESSION OF FOREIGN MINISTERS. KISSINGER AND GROMYKO INVESTED CONSIDERABLE EFFORT IN PERSUADING ISRAEL TO ENTER INTO THESE TALKS EVER BEFORE JAN 1. DESENGAGEMENT TALKS ARE IMPORTANT TO EGYPTIANS, SOVIETS AND AMERICANS BECAUSE THEY CREAT LINK IN A CHAIN WHICH PROMISES CONTINUATION OF THE CONFERENCE. EGYPT HAS BEEN CONCERNED BY SYRIAN NON-PARTICIPATION AT OPENING PHASE. JORDANIAN PARTICIPATION ONLY UNDERSCORED EGYPTS ISOLATION, WITH LIBYA, IRAQ, PALESTINIANS AND OTHERS REGARDING WAR AS PREFERABLE TO A PEACE CONFERENCE.\n5. SEPARATION OF FORCES. GENEVA TALKS WILL CONTINUE ON PATTERN ESTABLISHED AT KILOMETER 101. AMERICANS HAVE REJECTED SOVIET ATTEMPT TO INVOLVE THEMSELVES DIRECTLY. GROMYKO HAD TOLD EBAN THAT WITHDRAWAL, MEANING A SERIOUS SEPARATION, NOT JUST WITHDRAWAL FROM WEST BANK TO EAST BANK OF SUEZ CANAL, WAS VITAL FOR PEACE. SOVIETS AND EGYPTIANS WANT A WIDE BUFFER ZONE AND REOPENING OF SUEZ CANAL TO NEUTRALIZE DANGER OF WAR.\n6. PROSPECTS FOR ISRAEL-EGYPT AGREEMENT. EBAN SAID THAT GAP BETWEEN ISRAELIS AND EGYPTIANS WAS STILL WIDE. FAHMI WAS NOT ENTHUSIASTIC ABOUT ISRAELI DEFINITION OF SUBSTANCE OF PEACE. SINE EGYPTIANS DO NOT ACCEPT ISRAELS PEACE DEMANDS IN FULL, THEY CAN- NOT EXPECT THAT ISRAEL SHOUL* ACCEPT THEIR DEMAND FOR COMPLETE WITHDRAWAL. FIRST DECISION OF NEW ISRAELI GOVERNMENT IN JANUARY WILL BE TO DECIDE TO WHAT POINT IN SINAI ISRAEL WOULD BE PREPARED TO WITHDRAW WITHIN FRAMEWORK OF SEPARATION OF FORCES AGREEMENT-- UNCLASSIFIED  AND *HAT WILL BE COUNTER-VALUE DEMANDED. ISRAEL DOES NOT YET KNOW TO WHAT EXTENT AMERICANS WILL TRY TO CURTAIL MOMENTUM OF WITHDRAWAL WHICH SOVIETS AND EGYPTIANS WILL EXPECT.\n7. ISRAEL-SOVIET RELATIONS. AT THIS STAGE THERE IS NO POSSIBILITY OF RESUMPTION OF DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS. THIS WILL BE A REALISTIC SUBJECT ONLY AS A RESULT OF SERIOUS PROGRESS--THAT IS, A ""SIZABLE WITHDRAWAL"" FROM OUR PRESENT POSITIONS ON EGYPTIANS FRONT. BUT SOVIETS ARE INTERESTED IN MAINTAINING DIRECT TALKS WITH ISRAEL. SOVIET MOTIVATIONS ARE: A) DESIRE TO CONSOLIDATE THEIR POSITION AT GENEVA CONFERENCE; B) LACK OF SOVIET MOBILITY IN PREPARATIONS FOR CONFERENCE WHILE KISSINGER WAS ABLE TO MOVE EASILY ON BOTH SIDES; C) A REMAINDER TO ARABS THAT SOVIETS IDENTIFY WITH THEIR DEMAND FOR RETURN OF ALL TERRITORIES BUT NOT WITH ARAB PHILO- SOPHY OF WIPING ISRAEL OFF MAP. SOVIETS REGARD ISRAEL AS MIDDLE EAST COUNTRY ENTITLED TO LIVE IN PEACE AND SECURITY; D) SOVIETS BELIEVE THEY HAVE SOMETHING TO OFFER ISRAEL IN HER PRESENT ISOLATED INTERNATIONAL POSITION--TO HELP ISRAEL REHABILITATE HER POLITICAL POSITION IN WORLD.\n8. ISRAEL-JORDAN. EBAN SAID THAT HE HAS NO OBJECTION IN PRIN- CIPLE TO RIFAIS PROPOSAL, WHICH CAME AS A SUPRISE, BUT THAT THERE HAD TO BE PROCESS OF CONSULTATION BEFORE ESTABLISHMENT OF ANY WORKING GROUP. ON SUBSTANCE, ONE DID NOT HAVE TO TAKE LITERALLY PROPOSAL TO DISCUSS DISENGAGEMENT OF FORCES. WHAT IS MEANT IS THAT THERE SHOULD BE AN ISRAELI-JORDANIAN DISCUSSION ON AN INTERIM SETTLEMENT WITHOUT JORDAN HAVING TO WAIT IN LINE FOR ITS TURN. IN ANY CASE SETTLEMENT WITH EGYPT ALONE CANNOT BE STABLE FOR ANY LENGTH OF TIME IF IT COMES TO PASS AT ALL.\n9. PALESTINIANS. THIS ISSUE PLAYED LESS IMPORTANT ROLE AT GENEVA OPEINING THAN ISRAEL HAD ANTICIPATED. CONFERENCE CONSISTED OF REPRESENTATIVES OF STATES, NOT ORGANIZATIONS. JORDANIAN DELE- GATION HAD INCLUDED SEVEN PALESTINIANS.\n0. UN AUSPICES. SUSPICIONS ABOUT UN AUSPICES HAVE TURNED OUT TO BE EXAGGERATED.\n1. SYRIAN PARTICIPATION. IT IS STILL POSSIBLE THAT SYRIANS WILL ATTEND THE CONFERENCE. FOR TIME BEING THEY HAVE NOT ASKED TO CANCEL FACT THAT THEY PARTICIPATE IN GENEVA CONFERENCE. UNCLASSIFIED  12. KNESSET ELECTION. THERE ARE HARDLY APPROPRIATE WORDS TO DESCRIBE HOW FATEFUL ELECTION RESULTS REALLY ARE. VERY THOUGHT THAT BEGIN AND TAMIR (LIKUD) WOULD BE SITTING IN GENEVA, WITH THEIR DOGMATIC ATTITUDE, IS NIGHTMARE FOR ANYONE WHO HAS SERIOUS APPROACH TO CAUSE OF PEACE. ANOTHER DANGER IS THAT PRESENT LEADERSHIP MAY BE HAMPERED BY SUCH A MINUTE DIFFERENCE IN VOTES BETWEEN ALIGNMENT AND LIKUD, WITH NATIONAL RELIGIOUS PARTY (NRP) VASCILLATING BETWEEN THEM, THAT IT MAY BE FORCED TO SET UP IMPOTENT GOVERNMENT. GIVEN VIEWS OF RELIGIOUS PARTIES, LABOR ALIGNMENT MAY HAVE TO SEEK CHANNELS TO LIBERAL PARTY (LIKUD), WHICH IS LESS DOGMATIC THAN NRP IN POLITICAL AFFAIRS. KEATING\n",682140

SUMMARY. YAR PRESIDENT EXPRESSES GRATIFICATION WITH US ECONOMIC ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS. CRITICIZES\n2. I CALLED ON PRESIDENT IRYANI DECEMBER 23 TO PAY RESPECTS FOR FORTHCOMING MOSLIM HOLIDAY. THIS BEING ALSO APPROXIMATELY THE ONE YEAR ANNIVERSARY OF MY PRESEN- TATION OF CREDENTIALS, I DELIVERED TO PRESIDENT A LETTER SUMMARIZING PROGRESS MADE IN U.S. ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS, DIRECT AND INDIRECT. I WARMLY PRAISED COOPERATION RECEIVED FROM YEMENI OFFICIALS PRINCIPALLY CONCERNED WITH DEVELOPMENT MATTERS AND EXPRESSED HOPE THAT WHATEVER    SECRET\n3. PRESIDENT EXPRESSED APPRECIATION FOR U.S. ASSISTANCE, NOTING WITH A SMILE AN ARAB PROVERB THAT QUOTE SUCCESS IS THE KEY TO MORE UNQUOTE. SAID HE REALIZED NEED FOR CONTINUITY IN DEVELOPMENT MINISTRIES AND INTENDED RETAIN KEY OFFICIALS IN PRESENT JOBS INDEFINITELY.\n4. PRESIDENT SWITCHED QUICKLY TO SUBJECT MOST ON HIS MIND: SECRETARY KISSINGERS VISIT TO MIDDLE EAST; GENEVA CONFERENCE AND PROSPECTS FOR PEACE. OBVIOUSLY REFLECTING HIS DISCUSSION THREE DAYS EARLIER WITH SYRIAN FONMIN KHADDAM (SANAA 2424), HE COMMENTED THERE COULD BE NO LASTING PEACE IN MIDDLE EAST THAT DID NOT TAKE INTO ACCOUNT CONCERNS OF SYRIA AND THE PALESTINIANS.\n5. I REPLIED THAT SYRIAS REFUSAL GO TO GENEVA MUCH TO BE REGRETTED.  IT SEEMED THAT SYRIA  STILL TRYING TO PLAY THE OLD GAME OF SEEKING COMMITMENT ON CONCESSIONS PRIOR TO NEGOTION. USG COMMITTED TO WORK FOR IMPLEMENTATION OF RESOLUTION 242 IN CONTEXT OF A NEGOTIATION. GENEVA WAS THE ARENA IN WHICH SYRIA COULD PRESS ITS INTERESTS. IF IT DID NOT GO, IT WAS UNLIKELY THESE INTERESTS WOULD BE ADVANCED. SADAT HAS APPRECIATED THIS FACT AND HAD GOTTEN OUT OF THE INITIAL MEETINGS ESTABLISHMENT OF A MILITARY WORKING GROUP TO STUDY DISENGAGEMENT OF FORCES. YEMENI RELATIONS WITH SYRIA WERE CLOSE AND I HOPED YEMEN WOULD USE ITS INFLUENCE IN EFFORT PERSUADE SYRIA TO JOIN.\n6. PRESIDENT SAID HE HAD TALKED TO KHADDAM IN THIS SENSE. HOWEVER, KHADDAM HAD SAID DR. KISSINGER HAD HELD OUT LITTLE HOPE FOR ISRAELI WITHDRAWAL IN GOLAN AND THUS SYRIA HAD DECIDED TI NOT WORTHWHILE TAKE THE DOMESTIC POLITICAL RISKS OF ATTENDANCE AT GENEVA. IF GENEVA DISCUSSIONS PRODUCED SOME FIRST STEPS IN ISRAELI WITHDRAWAL, SYRIA MIGHT BE PERSUADED RECONSIDER. YARG WOULD CONTINUE WORK AT THIS. (PRESIDENTIAL POLITICAL ADVISER) NUMAN SEEING KHADDAM IN DAMASCUS    SECRET\n7. PRESIDENT SAID PEACE IN MIDDLE EAST, WHICH ALL SENSIBLE ARABS WANTED, ONLY ACHIEVABLE BY CONTINUED U.S. LEADER- SHIP AND USE OF U.S. LEVERAGE ON ISRAEL. IN THIS REGARD, ARABS FELT IT UNFORTUNATE THAT JUST AS NEGOTIATIONS BEGINNING U.S. PROVIDING ISRAEL WITH MORE THAN TWO BILLION DOLLARS IN NEW MILITARY ASSISTANCE. THIS NOT LIKELY INDUCE ISRAELI FLEXIBILITY IN NEGOTIATION.\n8. I REPLIED THAT U.S. SUPPORT OF ISRAEL IS A FACT, BUT SO IS OUR DESIRE FOR FRIENDSHIP WITH ARABS. NO SINGLE ARMS OR AID TRANSACTION WILL DETERMINE THE OUT- COME OF NEGOTIATIONS. THAT IS A FUNCTION OF U.S. SUSTAINED DETERMINATION AND COMMITMENT TO THE SEARCH FOR AN EQUITABLE PEACE, AND OF ALL PARTIES WILLINGNESS COMPROMISE REALISTICALLY. DR. KISSINGERS TWO VISITS TO THE MIDDLE EAST REFLECTED USGS COMMITMENT AND DETERMINATION.\n9. PRESIDENT AGREED. HE SAID HE WAS VERY MUCH CONCERNED, HOWEVER, THAT RUSSIA PLAYING AN OPPORTUNISTIC GAME TO EXPAND TIS INFLUENCE IN AREA. IF U.S. ABLE BRING SYRIA AND PALESTINIANS INTO NEGOTIATIONS AND IF PEACE WERE ATTAINED, THIS DANGER WIOULD BE AVERTED. ARABS WANTED AMERICAN FRIENDSHIP.  WITH PEACE, ARAB STATES QUOTE FROM MOROCCO TO GULF WILL BE WITH YOU UNQUOTE.\n0. IN MORE PHILOSOPHICAL VEIN, PRESIDENT SAID THAT SADATS BEHAVIOR SINCE OCTOBER COULD MARK A TURNING POINT IN ARAB HISTORY. HE HAS LED EGYPT AWAY FROM EMPTY RHETORIC AND SELF-DELUSION. AN OVERWHELMING MAJORITY IN ARAB WORLD HAVE APPLAUDED. IF HE SUCCEEDS IN OBTAINING A JUST PEACE, THIS NEW REALISM CAN SPREAD TO    SECRET\n",681409

SUMMARY. SYRIAN FOREIGN MINISTER INFORMS YARG THAT SINCE SECRETARY KISSINGER HAD BEEN UNABLE OFFER SYRIA ANYTHING CONCRETE ON RETURN OF ITS TERRITORY OR ON PALESTINIANS, SYRIA SAW NO REASON TAKE THE CONSIDERABLE POLITICAL RISKS OF ATTENDING GENEVA CONFERENCE. SYRIAN/EGYPTIAN RELATIONS NOT GOOD. SYRIA PLEASED, NEVERTHELESS, BY ADVANCE IN BILATERAL RELATIONS WITH U.S. SYMBOLIZED BY SECRETARYS VISIT AND AGREEMENT TO PLACE U.S. DIPLOMATS IN USINT SECTION IN DAMASCUS. IN YEMENI VIEW, UNDERLYING REASON FOR SYRIAS NON-ATTENDANCE AT GENEVA IS FEELING THAT IT HAS NOT BEEN SUFFICIENTLY CONSULTED ON KEY DECISIONS AND THAT USSR, US AND EGYPT ARE NOT INTERESTED IN ITS CONCERNS. YARG PRESIDENTIAL POLITICAL ADVISER NUMAN WILL BE SEEING KHADDAM IN DAMASCUS NEXT WEEK AND WOULD APPRECIATE RECEIVING STATEMENT OF US VIEWS BEFORE THEN. END SUMMARY.    SECRET\n2. PRESIDENTIAL POLITICAL ADVISER MUHAMMAD NUMAN ASKED ME TO CALL EVENING DECEMBER 20. HE AND PRESIDENT IRYANI HAD JUST CONCLUDED TWO HOUR MEETING WITH SYRIAN FOREIGN MINISTER KHADDAM WHO HAD EXPLAINED REASONS FOR SYRIAS REFUSAL ATTEND GENEVA CONFERENCE.\n3. ACCORDING TO NUMAN, KHADDAM TOLD YEMENIS THAT SECRETARY KISSINGERS VISIT TO DAMASCUS HAD BEEN A SUB- STANTIVE DISAPPOINTMENT. SECRETARY HAD NOT BEEN ABLE TO SAY ANYTHING CONCRETE ON MATTERS OF PCINCIPAL INTEREST TO SYRIA: SYRIAN TERRITORY AND PALESTINIAN RIGHTS. SECRETARY HAD DWELT ON ARRANGEMENTS FOR GENEVA. NEITHER HAD AMBASSADOR BUFFUM, ON FOLLOW-UP VISIT, BEEN ABLE SATISFY SYRIAS CONVCERNS OVER LACK OF SUBSTANTIVE COMMITMENT. SYRIAN-EGYPTIAN RELATIONS NOT GOOD. SYRIANS FELT US AND USSR PLACING ALL BETS ON EGYPT AND COUNTING ON IT TO PULL SYRIA ALONG WITHOUT REALLY CONSULTING OR CARING ABOUT SYRIAN PREOCCUPATIONS. KHADDAM SAID SYRIA PLEASE BY PERSONAL RAPPORT WHICH HAS DEVELOPED WITH SECRETARY, AND WITH ADVANCE IN BILATERAL RELATIONS REPRESENTED BY AGREEMENT ASSIGN U.S. DIPLOMATS TO USINT DAMASCUS.\n4. NUMAN SAID HE AND PRESIDENT IRYANI CAME AWAY FROM MEETING WITH KHADDAM WITH FEELING THAT SYRIAS PROBLEM IS ACTUALLY MORE PSYCHOLOGICAL THAN SUBSTANTIVE. SYRIA FOUGHT HARD, TOOK HEAVY LOSSES, AND LOST MORE TERRITORY. A FULL PARTNER IN BATTLE, IT CONSIDERS THAT IT HAS NOT BEEN TREATED BY EGYPT AS A FULL PARTNER IN DIPLOMACY.\n5. YARG WILL SEND REPRESENTATIVE TO SADAT, PROBABLY DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER MAKKI, IN NEXT FEW DAYS TO URGE EGYPT AND SYRIA RECONCILE PRESENT DIFFERENCES AND COOPERATE MORE CLOSELY ON APPROACH TO GENEVA AND PEACE.\n6. NUMAN ADVISED THAT HE PROCEEDING BEIRUT DECEMBER 21 FOR FEW DAYS VACATION WITH FAMILYOM HE HAD AGREED WITH KHADDAM THAT HE WOULD GO TO DAMASCUS SOMETIME IN WEEK    SECRET\n7. I TOLD NUMAN THAT WITHOUT KNOWLEDGE OF WHAT HAD TRANSPIRED DURING SECRETARYS VISIT TO DAMASCUS, IT NEVERTHELESS SEEMED TO ME FROM KHADDAMS REMARKS THAT SYRIA REPEATING THE OLD ARAB MISTAKE OF TRYING TO GET COMMITMENTS IN ADVANCE OF NEGOTIATION. USG INDEED COMMITTED TO WORK FOR IMPLEMENTATION OF 242 BUT IN CONTEXT OF NEGOTIATION. THIS IS WHAT GENEVA IS ALL ABOUT AND SYRIANS SHOULD BE PRESSING THEIR SUB- STANTIVE CONCERNS IN THAT AREA.\n8. NUMAN REMARKED THAT INABILITY OF US, USSR, AND EGYPT PERSUADE SYRIA GO TO GENEVA IS VERY WORRISOME. GIVEN POSITION OF IRAQ, AND NOW SYRIA, WHERE WOULD EGYPT BE IF ALGERIA SHOULD NOW HAVE SECOND THOUGHTS? SADAT IS OUT IN FRONT MOVING RESOLUTELY IN PURSUIT OF WHAT HE SEES AS EGYPTS INTERESTS. THERE IS DANGER IN HIS PULLING AWAY FROM THE BASE OF ARAB SUPPORT WHICH WAS CREATED IN ALGIERS. SUPPORT WILL ERODE IF OTHER ARABS COME TO BELIEVE THAT EGYPT IS CONCERNED ONLY ABOUT SOME TERRITORIAL SOLUTION IN SINAI AND REOPENING SUEZ CANAL AND IS NOT PUTTING ITS LEADERSHIP ON THE LINE IN REGARD TO SYRIAN TERRITORY, JUSTICE FOR PALESTINIANS AND JERUSALEM.\n9. ACTION REQUESTED:  I WOULD BE GRATEFUL IF AMBASSADOR BUFFUM COULD SEE NUMAN. NUMANS PERSONAL RELATIONS WITH KHADDAM ARE QUITE CLOSE AND THIS CHANNEL CAN PERHAPS PROVIDE SOME USEFUL ADDITIONAL INSIGHT INTO SYRIAN VIEWS. DEPARTMENT AND/OR GENEVA MAY WISH FEED IN FURTHER THOUGHTS. CRAWFORD\n",693443

SUMMARY: KING HUSUEIN INTERVIEW WITH LEIMONDE CORRESPONDENT AND LORIENT-LE JOUC EDITOR EDOUARD SAAB APPEARED HERE IN LORIENT AND AN NAHAR DEC 11.  KING REITERATED GOJ INTENTION NOT TO ATTEND GENEVA PEACE TALKS IF EGYPT AND SYRIA FAIL TO ""CLARIFY"" ALGIERS SUMMIT CONFERENCES ""EQUIVOCAL DECISION"" (I.E., RECOG- NITION OF PLO AS SOLE REP OF PALESTINIANS) TO JORDANS SATISFACTION.  MUCH OF INTERVIEW CONSISTED OF SENTIMENTS SIMILAR TO THOSE REPORTED AMMAN 6522 AND PREVIOUS. HOWEVER, IN CONTRAST TO HIS RECENT ""NONCHALANT"" ATTITUDE RE PROSPECT THAT EAST AND WEST BANKS MIGHT BECOME SEPARATED, KING SPOKE HEATEDLY AND AT LENGTH ON HISTORICAL AND GEORGRAPHICAL UNITY OF TWO BANKS AND DEBT WHICH PALESTINE CAUSE OWES TO HASHEMITES. HE EQUIVOCATED WHEN ASKED IF HE RETAINED CONFIDENCE IN JORDANS RELATIONSHIP WITH U.S.  FOLLOWING IS CONFIDENTIAL PRECIS OF KINGS MOST SIGNIFICANT REMARKS.  END SUMMARY.\n2. VEIPEACE TALKS: KING SAID GOJ HAD BEEN INFORMED OF CERTAIN ""PROCEDURAL DETAILS"" FOR GENEVA CONFERENCE, BUT THAT IT HAD NOT YET BEEN FORMALLY INVITED TO ATTEND.  IN ANY EVENT, HE SAID, JORDANIAN PARTICIPATION WOULD DEPEND ON WHETHER OTHER ARAB GOVTS., NOTABLY SYRIA AND EGYPT, COULD SATISFACTORILY ""CLARIFY"" ALGIERS SUMMITS ""EQUIVOCAL DECISION"" TO RECOGNIZE PLO AS SOLE PALESTINIAN REP.  ""BEFORE GOING TO GENEVA, WE MUST COORDINATE OUR POLICY AND ALL OUR INITIATIVES WITH EGYPT AND SYRIA.  WE MUST KNOW WHY WE ACCEPT NEGOTIATIONS, OR WHY WE REFUSE THEM, AND WE MUST UNDERSTAND BOTH THE REASONS FOR OUR CHOICE AND THE CONSEQUENCES THAT WILL FLOW FROM THAT CHOICE.""\n3. PLO-GOJ RELATIONS: KING MOCKED PLO CLAIM TO SPEAK FOR ALL PALESTICIANS, NOTED GOJ HAD ALWAYS REFRAINED FROM MAKING SUCH SWEEPING CLAIM, FOR ITSELF, AND INSISTED QUESTION OF SOLE REPRESENTIVITY COULD ONLY BE DECIDED BY REFERENDUM FOLLOWING ISRAELI WITHDRAWAL FROM OCCUPIED TERRITORIES.  AT SAME TIME, HE SAID GOJ WAS  WILLING CONSIDER ANY AND ALL PROPOSALS FOR INTE- GRATION OF REPS ""OF ALL POLITICAL CURRENTS WITHIN PALESTINE RESISTANCE"" IN JORDANIAN DELEGATION AT GENEVA.  ASKED IF THIS IS REALISTIC POSSIBILITY IN VIEW OF PAST GOJ-FEDAYEEN RELATIONS, KING REPLIED: ""I ENVISAGE AN ASSOCIATION FOR BETTER OR WORSE.  WHY NOT FORGET THE PAST, SINCE RESPONSIBILITY FOR EVENTS OF SEPTEMBER (1970) WAS AT LEAST SHARED.  AS MATTER OF FACT, THOSE ARMED CLASHES NEVER OPPOSED MUR TWO PEOPLES, BUT WERE BETWEEN A GOVT. THREATENED WITH DESTRUCTION AND ANARCHIST GROUPS WHICH WERE AT ODDS AMONG THEMSELVES AND DID NOT KNOW WHAT THEY WANTED"".\n4. FUTURE STATUS OF WEST BANK: AFTER REITERATING HIS PROMISE TO ACCORD SELF-DETERMINATION TO WEST BANK PALESTINIANS FOLLOWING ISRAELI WITHDRAWAL, KING NOTED HEATEDLY THAT ""NO ONE CAN DENY WHAT HASPEMITES HAVE DONE FOR PALESTINE SINCE BEGINNING OF THIS CENTURY. CONFIDENTIAL WE HAVE GIVEN EVERYTHING IN LIVES AND TREASURE, AND ON THIS SUBJECT WE TAKE NO LESSONS FROM ANYONE.\n5. OCTOBER WAR: AFTER DEFENDING JORDANS ROLE IN OCTOBER WAR ON GROUNDS THAT OVERRIDING NEED TO DEFEND EAST JORDAN WITH LIMIED MEANS LEFT GOJ WITH ONLY LIMITED MILITARY POTENTIAL, KING NOTED EGYPT AND SYRIA HAD NEVER INFORMED HIM THAT FIGHTING WOULD BEGIN ON OCT. 6 OR ANY OTHER DATE.  SAID THAT IN HIS CAIRO TALKS WITH SADAT AND ASSAD IN EARLY SEPTEMBER, ""WE TALKED ABOUT EVERYTHING EXCEPT WAR . . . NOT ONE WORD ABOUT H-HOUR FOR THE BATTLE"".  KING ALSO DENIGRATED FEDAYEEN MILITARY PERFORMANCE DURING OCTOBER FIGHTING, POINTING OUT HIS REFUSAL TO ALLOW COMMANDOS TO TRANSIT EAST JORDAN STEMMED FROM BELIEF THAT ""ONLY PLACE FOR FEDAYEEN ON BATTLEFIELD WAS INSIDE PALESTINE"" AND THAT THEY HAD MADE NO CONTRIBUTION IN THIS RESPECT.\n6. RELATIONS WITH U.S.: ASKED IF HE WAS SATISFIED WITH EVOLUTION IN JORDAN(S RALATIONSHIP WITH U.S., KING RESPONDED COLDLY: ""WE PUT OUR CONFIDENCE IN NO ONE.

YOU HAVE AGREED MEET JORDANIAN CHIEF OF STAFF, MAJOR GENERAL ZAID BIN SHAKER, MONDAY 24 DECEMBER.  MEETING WILL COME IN AFTERMATH DOD ARMS CONFERENCE, WHICH JORDANIANS CONSIDER DISAPPOINTING.  IN ADDITION BACKGROUND IN THIS CABLE, NEA WILL PROVIDE TALKING POINTS FOR YOUR MEETING. REQUEST GUIDANCE TO PARA 7 OPTIONS.  \n2.  BACKGROUND:  CONFERENCE WAS INTENDED FINALIZE FY 74 MAP PROGRAM AND PROJECT NEW PROGRAM TO FOLLOW THREE YEAR, DOLLARS 120 MILLION MILITARY ASSISTANCE PROGRAM BEGUN 1970 AND 1971.  DOD SENT TEAM (WITH STATE REPRESENTATION) TO JORDAN IN APRIL 1973 TO STUDY FOLLOW-ON NEEDS.  SUBSEQUENTLY STATE SENT DOLLARS 40 MILLION FY 75 MAP REQUEST TO OMB. GOJ REPEATEDLY ESCALATED ITS STATEMENTS OF NEEDS, HOWEVER,    SECRET  AND AFTER OCTOBER WAR -- AND TWO WEEKS BEFORE CONFERENCE -- PRESENTED DOLLARS 1.4 BILLION RPT BILLION LIST INCLUDING, FOR THE FIRST TIME, AIR DEFENSE MISSILES: HAWK, CHAPPARRAL, AND REDEYE.  IN LIGHT OF LARGE JORDANIAN REQUESTS, STATE CABLED THAT JANUARY CONFERENCE DATE WOULD BE PREFERABLE; BUT IF THEY PREFERRED WE COULD HEAR OUT THE JORDANIANS IN DECEMBER, ALBEIT WITHOUT MAKING DECISIONS.  THEY OPTED FOR   DECEMBER DATE.  YOUR GUIDANCE CALLED FOR US TO BE AS ""FORTHCOMING AS POSSIBLE WITHIN CONGRESSIONAL RESTRAINTS"" AND NOT TO LET DELEGATION LEAVE TOWN WITH ""SOUR TASTE IN THEIR MOUTHS.""  \n3.  INCONCLUSIVE TALKS:  CONFERENCE TOOK PLACE DECEMBER\n8.  WE OPENED BY MAKING CLEAR WE SOUGHT DETERMINE JORDANIAN REQUIREMENTS AND POSSIBLE USG OPTIONS AND WERE PREPARED LISTEN CAREFULLY AND SYMPATHETICALLY TO JORDANIAN REQUESTS.  WE STATED WE WOULD OBVIOUSLY TAKE AS POINT OF DEPARTURE OUR PAST PLANNING ABOUT LEVELS OF FUNDING AND EQUIPMENT MIXES, BUT WE WOULD LOOK WITH OPEN  MIND ON ANY RPT ANY JORDANIAN REQUEST.  WE EXPLAINED CONGRESSIONAL RESTRAINTS BUT SAID USG WAS NOT ONLY WILLING BUT DETERMINED TO DO ALL IT COULD TO SUPPORT A CLOSE FRIEND LIKE JORDAN. WE EXPRESSED FULL AWARENESS OF JORDANIAN POLITICAL REALI- TIES AND OUR UNDERSTANDING THAT JORDAN FACED THREATS AND DECISIONS IN FUTURE AS DIFFICULT AS ANY FACED IN PAST. WE EMPHASIZED WE HAD MUTUAL INTEREST IN DEFENDING INDEPEN- DENCE, INTEGRITY AND SECURITY OF HASHEMITE KINGDOM OF JORDAN.  APPOINTMENTS WERE ARRANGED FOR BIN SHAKER WITH MR. CLEMENTS, ADMIRAL MOORER AND ACTING ASSISTANT SECRETARY DAVIES TO STRESS OUR ASSURANCES.  \n4.  THE JORDANIANS, HOWEVER, DECLINED TO BREAK DOWN THEIR LIST INTO PRIORITIES OR INTO ANNUAL PACKAGES UNTIL WE PROVIDED A FIGURE FOR MAP AND CREDIT IN FY 75.  THIS PRO- DUCED A KIND OF STALEMATE WHICH SEVERAL DOD MILITARY OFFICERS FOUND UNREASONABLE.  AT END OF FIRST DAY, IN MOVE NOT CLEARED WITH STATE REPS, ONE DOD OFFICER HANDED SHARIF ZAID A FY 75 PROPOSAL WHICH SUGGESTED NO RPT NO AIRCRAFT OR AIR DEFENSE MISSILES WOULD BE INCLUDED.  IT WAS CLEARLY A PACKAGE OF UNDER DOLLARS 40 MILLION.  SHARIF    SECRET  ZAID WAS VISIBLY ANGERED BY THIS PROPOSAL.  TALKS NEXT DAY WERE CLEARLY INCONCLUSIVE AND DISAPPOINTING TO JORDANIANS.  ACTING SECRETARY RUSH, HOWEVER, BOTH CALLED AND WROTE MR. CLEMENTS TO SUGGEST A NUMBER OF WAYS (WHICH ARE MENTIONED BELOW) OF SALVAGING THE CONFERENCE.  \n5.  AFTERMATH OF THE CONFERENCE:  IN THREE DAYS THAT FOLLOWED THE CONFERENCE DOD, WITH PRODDING BY STATE, CAME UP WITH ATTRACTIVE PACKAGE FOR BIN SHAKER TO TAKE BACK TO AMMAN.  IN MEETING WITH UNDER SECRETARY DONALDSON, ON THURSDAY 20 DECEMBER, BIN SHAKER SAID HE DISAPPOINTED WITH TALKS ON FY 75 BUT DECLARED HIMSELF SATISFIED WITH THE FY 74 PROGRAM AND THE FOLLOWING OTHER ""SWEETNERS"":   (A)  AN FY 74 PROGRAM WITH TWO ITEMS -- 1000 M60 MACHINE   GUNS AND 36 TOW LAUNCHERS (PLUS MISSILES) -- WHICH JORDAN HAD SOUGHT AS PRIORITY SUBSTITUTES FOR OTHER ITEMS. (SEE PARA 8 FOR BACKGROUND ON TOW DELIVERY.)   (B)  OFFER TO SELL 130 M48A1 TANKS AND ASSOCIATED EQUIP- MENT AT A ROCK-BOTTOM PRICE OF DOLLARS 21,870 FOR EACH TANK.  JORDAN WILL REHABILITATE THESE TANKS RATHER THAN SEEKING DIVERSION OF THE MORE MODERN M48A3 TANKS FROM U.S. ARMY STOCKS.   (C)  OFFER TO SELL, WITH SHORTENED DELIVERY  TIMES, ABOUT\n5.  THIS OFFER WAS UNEXPECTED AND VERY WELCOME.   (F)  OFFER TO SEND AN AIR DEFENSE TEAM TO STUDY JORDANS NEEDS.   (G)  PROMISE TO PROVIDE JORDAN IN THE NEAR FUTURE WITH    SECRET  FIRM FY 75 PROPOSALS, BASED ON CREDIT AND GRANT AID, AS PROVIDED BY CONGRESS AND OTHER CONSIDERATIONS.   UNDER SECRETARY DONALDSON STATED HE HAD BEEN ASKED BY SECRETARY TO TAKE A PERSONAL AND DIRECT INTEREST IN JORDAN PROGRAM.  \n6.  FINALLY, AT STATE INITIATIVE, AN INFORMAL RUMP SESSION WAS HELD IN THE WATERGATE HOTEL, WITH THE RESULT THAT THE JORDANIANS PRESENTED A SCALED DOWN (DOLLARS 26L MILLION) FY 75 REQUEST.  THIS CONTAINS NO RPT NO AIR DEFENSE MISSILES, AND OFFERS GOOD BASIS FOR FURTHER DISCUSSIONS. DOD IS ACCORDINGLY THINKING OF SENDING AN ISA TEAM TO AMMAN AFTER NEW YEAR TO PRESENT USG PROPOSALS.  THIS WILL ALLOW TIME FOR COORDINATION WITH YOU FOLLOWING OPENING OF THE GENEVA CONFERENCE.  \n7.  ANALYSIS AND POSSIBLE OPTIONS:  JORDANIANS CAME WITH UNREASONABLE EXPECTATIONS AT A TIME WHEN WE WERE UNABLE MAKE COMMITMENTS.  IN PART BECAUSE OF OUR OPENHANDEDNESS WITH THE ISRAELIS, AND THE SOVIET GENEROSITY WITH SYRIA AND EGYPT, THE JORDANIANS WERE GENERALLY INFLEXIBLE ABOUT THEIR REQUESTS DURING THE FORMAL TALKS.  DOD WAS RESPONSIVE,   HOWEVER, ALBEIT BELATEDLY.  WHILE BIN SHAKER CONTINUES TO EXPRESS DISAPPOINTMENT, THIS IS IN PART A TACTIC.  AT A MINIMUM, HE SHOULD NOW HAVE A MORE SOBER ESTIMATE OF OUR ABILITY TO RESPOND; HE SHOULD NOT RPT NOT HAVE ANY DOUBTS ABOUT OUR WILLINGNESS AND DETERMINATION TO DO SO TO THE FULLEST EXTENT POSSIBLE.  THE USG IS NOW IN A POSITION TO DESIGN A PROGRAM TO PRESENT TO KING HUSSEIN TO ASSURE THE GOJ THAT WE WILL DO EVERYTHING POSSIBLE TO MEET JORDANS NEEDS IN THE COMING, CRUCIAL SETTLEMENT PERIOD. OUR OPTIONS IN THE MEETING WITH BIN SHAKER WOULD THUS SEEM TO BE AS FOLLOWS:   (A)  REPEAT EARLIER ASSURANCES, AS AT THE CONFERENCE, WITH- OUT MAKING ANY COMMITMENTS.   (B)  INFORM THE GOJ THAT, DESPITE THE LACK OF A PRESIDEN- TIAL DECISION ON FY 75 BUDGET, WE EXPECT THE JORDAN PRO-    SECRET  GRAM TO HAVE AT LEAST THE DOLLARS 40 MILLION WE REQUESTED FROM OMB.   (C)  STATE YOU WILL SEEK TO INCREASE MILITARY ASSISTANCE TO JORDAN ABOVE THE DOLLARS 40 MILLION FY 74 LEVEL.  \n8.  BACKGROUND ON TOW DELIVERIES:  AFTER U.S. ARMY PROTESTS ABOUT DIVERTING ALL 36 TOW  LAUNCHERS AND 648 MISSILES FROM ACTIVE UNITS, DOD AGREED TO AIRLIFT 18 LAUNCHERS (AND HALF THE MISSILES) TO JORDAN AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.  DELIVERY IS NOW SCHEDULED FOR DECEMBER 23, SUBJECT TO OVERFLIGHT CLEARANCES.  THE NEXT 18 LAUNCHERS AND MISSILES WILL BE TAKEN FROM PRODUCTION AND SHOULD BE AVAILABLE FOR SHIPMENT IN MARCH.  CHIEF OF STAFF BIN SHAKER ASSENTED TO THESE ARRANGEMENTS EVEN THOUGH THE GOJ HAD EARLIER BEEN TOLD THAT ALL THE MISSILES AND LAUNCHERS WOULD BE AIRLIFTED AT ONCE.

from me to Prime Minister Meir2 Begin textDear Madam Prime MinisterI want to bring you up to date on the latest developments with regard to                        Syrian participation in the conference at GenevaWe have just been informed by Ambassador Eilts that the Egyptians sent Foreign Minister Fahmy to                        Damascus yesterday to seek Syrian agreement Fahmy ran into the same problem                        with President Asad as I didnamely                        that he wants prior agreement on SyrianIsraeli disengagement before sending                        a Syrian delegation to the conference In these circumstances the Egyptians                        have asked that the first sentence of the second paragraph of the letter to                        the Secretary General regarding the parties agreeing to attend the                        conference be revised so Egypt can attend the conference in any caseFahmy also insists on staying with the original language about UN auspices in the last sentence of paragraph                        onenamely The conference should be convened under the auspices of the                        United NationsThe language in the previous                            draft reads: The convening of the conference should be under the                            auspices of the United Nations To deprive the Syrians of using                        a change in this sentence as a pretext for not going to Geneva I have                        agreedas you said we couldto restore the original language quoted above                        We would have no objection to Israels declaring publicly that the UN auspices apply only to convening the                        conference and we shall support this interpretationWith respect to the other change suggested by Fahmy in the interest of speed                        we have tentatively agreed to the new language quoted below This does not                        change the substance and will make it possible to convene the conference                        without Syrian participation if the latter do not respond positively to                            Waldheim The absence of Syria                        from the conference would of course relieve you of the nightmare you                        described to me and enable you to make progress

THERE FOLLOWS VERBATIME ADVANCE TEXT (UNNECESSARY WORDS OMITTED) OF PRIMIN MEIRS SPEECH DEC 20 BEFORE KNESSET, EXCEPT FOR FIRT THREE PARAGRAPHS WHICH WE HAVE SUMMARIZED.\n2. AFTER ENTAILING VIRTUES OF CEASEFIRE STABILIAZTION AGREEMENT OF NOV 11 AND KM 101 TALKS, MRS MEIR CONTINUED: BEGIN TEXT. THE TALKS HAVE BEEN BROKEN OFF, TO OUR GREAT REGRET, BUT NEED TO STABILIZE CEASEFIRE BY SEPARATION OF FORCES REMAINED. WE EXPRESSED OUR READINESS TO RESUME DISCUSSION OF SUBJECT WHEN PEACE CONFERENCE CONVENES, IN HOPE OF REACHING AN AGREE- MENT. BREAKING- OFF OF TALKS AT KM 101 ON EGYPTS INITIATIVE MADE IT NECESSARY TO EXERCISE REDOUBLED ALERTNESS IN MILITARY AREA, IN VIEW OF POSSIBILITY OF AGRESSIVE MOVES ON PART OF EGYPT. UNCLASSIFIED 3. REGRETTABLY DESPITE EGYPTIAN GOVERNMENTS COMMITMENT TO CEASEFIRE, BREACHES OF CEASEFIRE OCCUR ALMOST EVERY DAY THROUGH FIRE FROM EGYPTIAN ARMY POSITIONS TOWARDS OUR FORCES. HUNDREDS OF SUCH INCIDENTS HAVE TAKEN PLACE SINCE OCT 24, AND THER HAVE EVEN BEEN CASUALTIES. ON THIS OCCASION, I CALL UPON EGYPTIAN AUTHORITIES TO COMPLY WITH THEIR OBLIGATION TO OBSERVE CEASEFIRE-- TO PUT SAFETY-CATCH ON THEIR ARMS.\n4. ALL THIS TIME, US SECRETARY OF STATE KISSINGER, HAS BEEN CONTINUING HIS EFFORTS TO GET AGREEMENT FROM PARTIES CONCERNED TO TAKE PART IN PEACE CONFERENCE BETWEEN OURSELVES AND OUR NEIGHBORS. IN COURSE OF HIS EFFORTS, HE HAS VISITED ARAB CAPITALS AND CAPITAL OF ISRAEL. IN OUR TALKS IN JERUSALEM, FOLLOW- ING UPON MY TALKS WITH HIM IN WASHINGTON, I DISCUSSED WITH SECRETARY OF STATE IMPORTANH ISSURES IN CONNECTION WITH CONFERENCE. QUESTION OF AUSPICES FOR CONFERENCE, STATES WHOSE REPRESENTATIVES WOULD BE INVITED, STAGES OF DISCUSSIONS, AND SO FORTH, WERE DISCUSSED. WE ALSO HELD DETAILED DISCUSSION ON QUESTION OF SEPARATION OF FORCES, AND ISSUE WHICH DR KISSINGER WISHED TO STUDY THOROUGHLY IN CONTACTS WITH AUTHORITIES OF EGYPT AND ISRAEL. THIS DISCUSSION HAS NOT YET BEEN COMPLETED.\n5. SPONSORS OF CONFERENCE--UNITED STATES AND SOVIET UNION-- HAD INTENDED TO CONVENE IT ON DEC 18, BUT THEY HAD TO COMMUNI- CATE WITH GOVERNMENTS CONCERNING THEIR LETTER TO UN SECRETARY GENERAL, WHO IS CONVENING CONFERENCE. AS A RESULT OF THESE DISCUSSIONS WITH THE PARTIES--ISRAEL INCLUDED--THERE WAS A POSTPONEMENT. IN LETER FROM US AND USSR TO UN SECRETARY GENERAL, DATED DEC 18, 1973, WHICH WAS COMPOSED FOLLOWING DELIBERATIONS WITH THE PARTIES, IT IS STATED: (VERBATIM TEXT OF SYGS LETTER OF INVITATION AS CONTAINED USUN 5704 FOLLOWS.)\n6. US SECRETARY OF STATE ATTACHED SUPREME IMPORTANCE TO OPENING CONFERENCE WITHIN MONTH OF DECEMBER. IT APPEARS TO ME THAT HE WAS ANXIOUS OVER POSSIBILITY OF ANY POSTPONEMENT, LEST OBSTACLES CROPPED UP AND POSSIBLY EVEN FIRING WAS RESUMED. WE TOO, FOR OUR PART, WERE NOT INTERESTED INDELAYS OR POSTPONE- MENTS FOR VERY SAME REASONS. OUR FORCES ARE DEPLOYED AGAINST ANY AGGRESSIVE INITIATIVE BY EGYPT OR SYRIA, BUT WE DO NOT WANT RESUMPTION OF WAR. UNCLASSIFIED 7. ISRAEL AGREEMENT WAS, THEREFORE, GIVEN TO OPENING OF CONFERENCE IN DECEMBER, PROVIDED SUBSTATIVE DISCUSSIONS ON VARIOUS ASPECTS OF SUBJECT OF PEACE ARE HELD AT LATER DATE, AFTER ELECTIONS TO EIGHT KNESSET, AND ARE CONDUCTED ON RESPONSIBILITY OF A CABINET WHICH SHALL HAVE RECEIVED CONFIDENCE OF NEW KNESSET. I AM HAPPY TO NOTE THAT THIS CONDI- TION OF OURS HAS BEEN ACCEPTED. CONFERENCE WILL OPEN TOMORROW, FRIDAY, DEC 21, 1973, BEFORE KNESSET ELECTIONS, BUT INITIAL STAGE WILL BE BRIEF AND FORMAL ONLY AND WILL LAST TWO DAYS. AT OPENING CEREMONY, ADDRESSES WILL BE DELIVERED BY FOREIGN MINISTERS OF INVITED STATES, AS WELL AS FOREIGN MINISTERS OF UNITED STATES AND SOVIET UNION AND SECRETARY GENERAL OF UNITED NATIONS. THERE WILL BE AN INTERVAL THEREAFTER, AND CONFERENCE WILL BE RESUMED IN COURSE OF JANUARY.\n8. AS AFORSAID, CONFERENCE STARTS TOMORROW, AND MUCH TO OUR REGRET, DESPITE ALL OUR EFFORTS TO ENSURE THAT THERE WILL BE NO SESSIONS ON SABBATH, NO WAY WAS FOUND TO CHANGE TIMING DETERMINED, AND IT WILL INDEED CONTINUE ALSO ON SATURDAY, DEC 22, 1973.\n9. OPENING STAGE WILL LAST ONLY TWO DAYS, BUT DURING THIS SHORT PERIOD ARRANGEMENTS AND PROCEDURES WILL BE DETERMINED WHICH WILL INFLUENCE ENTIRE COURSE OF CONFERENCE, AND IT DOES NOT APPEAR FEASIBLE TO ME THAT WE CAN AFFORD TO BE ABSENT FROM HALF THE TIME OF DISCUSSIONS. MINISTER FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS ANNOUNCED AT CABINET SESSION THAT ISRAELS REPRESENTATIVES WHO WILL BE COMPELLED-- IN THIS GIVEN SITUATION-TO PARTICIPATE IN DISCUSSIONS ON SATURDAY, WILL, OF COURS, SCRUPULOUSLY REFRAIN FROM DESE- CRATING SABBATH.\n0. ALMOST CERTAINLY, FIRST MATTER TO BE DEALT WITH BY CONFERENCE IN JANUARY 1974 WILL BE DISENGAGEMENT OF FORCES, WHICH IS PART OF CEASEFIRE AGREEMENT (ARTICLE 2 OF SIX-POINT AGREEMENT). I HAVE NOTED THAT PRESIDENT SADAT HAS SAID PUBLICLY THAT HE ALSO IS PREPARED TO MAKE PROGRESS IN DISCUSSIONS ON THIS SUBJECT, AND WE SHALL BE PREPARED TO TAKE PART IN THESE DISCUSSIONS EVEN BEFORE NEW GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN FORMED. AS I HAVE SAID, PRINCI- PAL STAGE OF CONFERENCE WILL BEGIN AND CONTINUE ACCORDING TO DIRECTIVES OF NEW GOVERNMENT. UNCLASSIFIED UNCLASSIFIED\n1. IN ORAL AND WRITTEN CONTACTS WITH PRESIDENT OF UNITED STATES, MR RICHARD NIXON, AND SECRETARY OF STATE, DR KISSINGER, MAIN CONDITIONS AND POLITICAL FRAMEWORK FOR CONVENING OF CONFERENCE HAVE BEEN THOROUGHLY CLARIFIED. IN COURSE OF THESE CONTACTS, WE HAVE AGREED TO DEFINITION OF FUNCTION OF UNITED NATIONS. FUNCTION ALLOTTED TO UN HAS BEEN THOROUGHLY CLARIFIED: AUSPICES OF UN ARE LIMITED TO CONVENING OF CONFERENCE. UN SECRETARY GENERAL, DR WALDHEIM, WILL SERVE AS CONVENER OF CONFERENCE AND CHAIRMAN AT ITS OPENING SESSION. UN SECRETARY GENERAL DISPATCHED INVITATIONS AT REQUEST OF US AND USSR, IN THEIR LETTER WHICH I HAVE ALREADY MENTIONED. HE WILL ENSURE THAT UN ORGANIZATION WILL PLACE AT DISPOSAL OF CONFERENCE SERVICES REQUIRED FOR EFFECTIVE WORKING.\n2. ON DEC 15, SECURITY COUNCIL ADOPTED DISTURBING RESOLU- TION IN REFERENCE TO PEACE CONFERENCE. FOUR OF PERMANENT MEMBERS, INCLUDING US AND USSR, ABSTAINED. LET US RECALL THAT ISRAEL HAS NO DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS WITH FIVE OUT OF TEN STATES THAT VOTED FOR RESOLUTION. I MUST MAKE IT CLEAR THAT ANY ATTEMPT TO INCLUDE SUB- JECTS OF DISCUSSIONS AT PEACE CONFERENCE WITHIN ACTIVITY AND AUTHORITY OF SECURITY COUNCIL WILL BE IN DANGEROUS CONTRADICTION TO BASIS AND PURPOSE OF CONFERENCE, AND WILL MEET WITH EXPLICIT UNCLASSIFIED OPPOSITION ON OUR PART. IT IS INCONCEIVABLE THAT US SHOULD ACQUIESCE IN SUCH A BREACH OF AGREED ASSUMPTIONS. WE SHALL NOT FIND OURSELVES ISOLATED IN FACING SUCH A DANGEROUS MOVE, WHICH VIOLATES CONSENT WHICH IS BASIS OF PEACE CONFERENCE.\n3. ARAB STATES WHICH HAVE BEEN INVITED TO TAKE PART IN CONFERENCE ARE EGYPT, JORDAN AND SYRIA, LEBANON HAS NOT YET BEEN INVITED, BUT I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT IT WILL BE INVITED AT LATER STAGE. EGYPT AND JORDAN HAVE ACCEPTED INVITATION, WHILE SYRIA HAS REPLIED IN NEGATIVE.\n4. WITH GREAT REGRET I HAVE TO INFORM HOUSE THAT SYRIAN RULERS STILL REPLY WITH FLAT REFUSAL TO OUR DEMAND FOR LIBERATION OF OUR PRISONERS. ON OUR PART PROPOSALS HAVE BEEN MADE TO THEM WHICH ARE BEYOND LIMITS OF OUR COMMITMENTS-- BUT IN VAIN. INFLUENTIAL POLITICAL ELEMENTS HAVE REPEATEDLY APPEALED TO SYRIAN RULERS--WITHOUT EFFECT. PRESIDENT OF SYRIA, WHO WAS ASKED TO DISCUSS SUBJECT OF PRISONERS, STATED THAT FROM HUMANITARIAN ASPECT THIS WAS NOT SUBJECT REQUIRING PARTICULAR DISCUSSION. AND NOW SYRIANS HAVE DECLARED THAT THEY WILL NOT BE COMING TO GENEVA.\n5. I DO NOT KNOW HOW SYRIANS EXPLAIN THEIR REFUSAL TO TAKE PART IN PEACE CONFERENCE. EVEN BEFORE THEY CAME OUT WITH THIS STATEMENT WE MADE IT CLEAR- BOTH FROM KNESSET ROSTRUM AND TO REPRESENTATIVES OF US- THAT AS LONG AS NO LIST OF OUR PRISONERS IS RECEIVED BY US AND RED CROSS IS NOT PERMITTED TO VISIT THEM, WE CANNOT SIT DOWN WITH THEM AT GENEVA CONFERENCE AT ANY STAGE.\n6. WE TRIED  TO MAKE CONTACT WITH SYRIANS THROUGH REPRESENTA- TIVES OF US AND OF REDCROSS. THROUGH US REPRESENTATIVE WE LEARNED OF SYRIAN PROPSOAL THAT WE AGREE TO RETURN OF 15,000 SYRIAN CITIZENS TO AREAS CAPTURED BY IDF IN YOM KIPPUR WAR, AND TO RETURN TWO SYRIAN POSITONS ON MT. HERMON. IF WE COMPLIED THERE WOULD BE AN EXCHANGE OF PRISONERS. WE AGREED TO RETURN OF CIVILIANS AND TO STATIONING OF UN FORCES IN TWO POSITIONS REFERRED TO. WHAT IS MORE, IN MY TALK WITH DR. GUYER, ASSISTANT SECRETARY-GENERAL OF UN, I PROPOSED THAT MEETING BETWEEN SENIOR ISRAELI AND SYRIAN OFFICERS BE HELD, SIMILAR TO KILOMETER 101. WE DIDNOT UNCLASSIFIED RECEIVE ANY AFFIRMATIVE REPLY.\n7. I REALIZE AND UNDERSTAND WHAT MUST BE FEELINGS OF FAMILIES WHOSE DEAR ONES HAVE BEEN TAKEN PRISONER BY SYRIANS. ALL OF US ARE AGHAST AT DREADFUL NEWS AND RUMOURS WHICH HAVE REACHED US. WE SHALL NOT CEASE IN OUR EFFORTS TO SECURE INTER- VENTION OF FACTORS WHICH CAN SPEED UP LIBERATION OF OUR SOLDIERS. SYRIAN RULERS ARE ASSUMING TERRIBLE RESPONSIBILITY, AND WE WILL NOT EXEMPT THEM FROM THIS RESPONSIBILITY.\n8. NEGOTIATIONS ON PEACE IN MIDDLE EAST MUST BE CONDUCTED BETWEEN STATES CONCERNED: NAMELY, BETWEEN ISRAEL ON ONE HAND AND ISRAELS NEIGHBOURS-EGYPT, JORDAN, SYRIA AND LEBANON- ON THE OTHER. THERE IS NO REASON TO INVITE TO PARTICIPATE IN THESE NEGOTIATIONS ANY ADDITIONAL STATES BESIDES US AND USSR, WHICH UNDERTOOK SPONSORSHIP OF CONFERENCE. THERE IS NO CONCEIVABLE OBJECTIVE CRITERION BY WHICH ADDITIONAL STATES SHOULD BE INVITED. WE ARE AWARE OF FACT THAT REPRESENTATIVES OF VARIOUS STATES HAVE EXPRESSED THEIR WISH TO TAKE PART IN CONFERENCE. THIS INCLUDES STATES NOT OUTSTANDING IN THEIR NEUTRALITY. ISRAEL GOVENMENT HAS EXPRESSED ITS OPPOSITION TO INVITATION OF ADDITIONAL STATES OR OF NON-SOVEREIGN FACTORS, AND WE ARE CONVINCED THAT BY THIS OPPOSITION WE ARE SAFEGUARDING CONFERENCE AGAINST DANGEROUS COMPLICATIONS.\n9. IT IS ONLY NATURAL THAT WE SHOULD HAVE VOICED OUR EXPLICIT OPPOSITION TO ANY NOTION OF INVITING TERRORIST ORGANIZATIONS UNDER THE AEGIS OF PLO OR ANY OTHER ORGANIZATION, AT ANY STAGE WHATSOEVER. IT IS INCONCEIVABLE THAT WE SHOULD AGREE TO TAKE PART IN CONFERENCE TO WHICH REPRESENTATIVES OF THESE ORGANIZATIONS SHOULD BE INVITED, NOT TO SPEEK OF NEGOTIATING WITH REPRESENTATIVES OF ORGANIZATIONS WHOSE DECLARED AIM IS DESTRUCTION OF STATE OF ISREL. WE HAVE NO COMMON DENOMINATOR WITH ORGANIZATINS THAT ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR ACTS OF TERRORISM AND MURDER. WE SHALL NEGOTIATE WITH REPRESENTATIVES OF NEIGHBOURING STATES, WITH WHICH WE HAVE CEASE-FIRE AGREEMENTS.\n0. WE ARE NOT IGNORING DISTURBING FACT THAT ONE OF POWERS UNDER WHOSE AUSPICES CONFERENCE IS MEETING HAS SEVERED DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS WITH ISRAEL. THIS POWER PLAYED CONSIDERABLE PART IN DEVELOPING ARAB MILITARY STRENGTH AND IN PREPARING EGYPT AND SYRIA FOR WAR.IN COURSE OF CONFERENCE, IT WILL BECOME CLEAR WHETHER THIS POWER IS ACUALLY CONDUCTING ITSELF IN MANNER FITTING TO AIM OF PEACE CONFERENCE.\n1. I AM CONVINCED THAT POLICY OF US AT PEACE CONFERENCE WILL BE GUIDED BY SONCERE GOODWILL AND WILL BE DESIGNED TO OFFER AID TO PARTIES, AS REQUIRED,D IN ORDER TO BRING ABOUT SUCCESSFUL CONCLUSION OF NEGOTIATIONS AND ACHIEVE CONTRACTUAL AND BINDING PEACE TREATY.\n2. ROLE FULFILLED BY US SINCE OCTOBER 6 AND UNTIRING EFFORTS OF SECRETARY OF STATE KISSINGER IN CAIRO, AMMAN AND OTHER ARAB CAPITALS HAVE BEEN OF NO SMALL ASSISTANCE TO CESSATION OF HOSTILITIES AND TO ACHIEVEMENT OF SIX-POINT AGREEMENT REPRESENTING LOGICAL AND OPERATIONAL CONTINUATION OF THE SECURITY COUNCILS CEASE-FIRE RESOLUTION. WE ARE ENCOURAGED BY CLEAR-CUT STAND OF US, AS FREQUENTLY EXPRESSED IN PUBLIC, IN FAVOUR OF DIRECT NEGOTIATIONS BETWEEN PARTIES. UNCLASSIFIED WITH HELP OF THIS CLEAR-CUT POLICY, WE HOPE TO ACHIEVE SIGNIFICANT AND DIRECT NEGOTIATIONS WITH EACH OF ARAB STAES BORDERING UPON ISRAEL, AND TO ADVANCE TOWARDS SETTLEMENT OF QUESTIONS IN DISPUTE.\n3. WE ATTACH SUPREME IMPORANCE TO WHAT IS STATED IN SC RE 338 ON SUBJECT OF NEGOTIATIONS. THIS TIME THERE IS EXPLICIT REFERENCE TO NEGOTIATIONS BETWEEEN PARTIES: UP TO THAT POINT THERE HAD BEEN NO LACK OF ATTEMPTS AT MEDIATION, SPONSORSHIP AND GOOD MFFICES, ALL OF THEM WITHOUT DIRECT NEGOTIATIONS. ISRAEL WILL BE ON WATCH THAT NO MISINTERPRETATION SHALL ARISE ON THIS PMINT, WHICH IS POSITIVE AND SIGNIFICANT INNOVATION IN SECURITY COUNCIL RESOLUTION 338.\n4. GOVERNMENT OF ISRAEL WILL SEND IT AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVES TO PEACE CONFERENCE WITH CLEAR CUT DIRECTIVES TO MAKE EVERY EFFORT TO ADVANCE TOWARDS AND ATTAIN PEACE. SUBSTANTIVE DIRECTIVES WILL BE ISSURE BY NEW GOVERMENT, AND I DO NOT TAKE IT UPON MYSELF TO DEFINE NOW ITS ATTITUDES ON MAJOR POINTS AT ISSURE. HOWEVER, I HOPE AND BELIEVE THAT NEW GOVERN- MENT TO BE ESTABLISHED BY EIGHTH KNESSET AFTER ELECTIONS WILL EXPRESS OUR PEOPLES YEARNINGS OF PEACE WITHIN DEFENSIBLE BORDERS.\n5. ON THRESHHOLD OF CONFERENCE, I SHALL MAKE NO ATTEMPT TO EXAMINE ATTITUES OF GOVERNMENTS OF ARAB STATES. THERE WILL BE TIME FOR THIS IN COURSE OF DISCUSSIONS AT CONFERENCE. INFLU- ENCE OF ALGIERS CONFERENCE, ITS DELIBERATIONS AND RESOLUTIONS, CANNOT BUT GIVE RISE TO CONCERN. HOWEVER, WE SHALL NOT CEASE TO HOPE FOR A TURNING POINT, A NEW APPROACH, FOR THROWING OFF OF SHACKLES OF EXTREME ATTITUDES DEVOID OF ANY SENSE OF REALITY. I WOULD LIKE ARAB STATES TO PROCEED TO PEACE CONFERENCE IN SAME SPIRIT OF SINCERITY, IMBUSED WITH SAME INSPIRATIONS THAT ANIMATE PEOPLE AND GOVERNMENT OF ISRAEL- FOR THEN ROAD TO PEACE WILL BE SMOOTH IN BOTH DIRECTIONS.\n6. SEVENT KNESSET IS CONCLUDING ITS TERM OF OFFICE IN WAKE OF DIFFICULT TRIALS AND SIGNIFICANT VICTORY OF YOM KIPPUR WAR. PEACE CONFERENCE WILL BE OPENING WITH SEVENTH KNESSET NOT YET HAVING COMPLETED ITS TERM. UNCLASSIFIED NO EFFORT MUST BE SPARED TO ENABLE STATE OF ISRAEL-DURING TERM OF EIGHTH KNESSET TO REACH AN AGREEMENT ON SEPARATION OF FORCES AND, WHAT IS MORE, ACHIEVE CNETRAL OBJECTIVES OF OUR POLICY- A LATING PEACE. ONCE STAGE OF SUBSTANTIVE DISCUSSIONS IS REACHED, ISRAELS DELEGATES WILL STRIVE FOR CONTRA- TUAL PEACE BETWEEN PARTIES, WITH DEFENSIBLE BORDERS, AND IN ACCORDANCE WITH GUIDELINES WHICH, IN MY BELIEF, WILL BE EXPRESSED IN BASIC POLICY OF NEXT GOVERNMENT.\n7. ISRAELS PARTICIPATION IN TALKS IS NOT SUBJECT TO ANY PRIOR CONDITIONS. ISRAEL HAS NOT DEMANDED PRIOR ACCEPTANCE OF HER POSITIONS BY OTHER PARTIES, NOR IS SHE ACCEPT- ING BEFOREHAND CONDITIONS OF OTHER PARTIES, AS STATED BY THEM PUBLICLY AND OTHERWISE, BUT EACH SIDE WILL BE FREE TO SUBMIT ITS PROPOSALS ON THE SUBJECTS UNDER DISCUSSION.\n8. WE ARE AWARE OF DIFFICULTIES AND STRUGGLES AHEAD OF US. WE ARE ALERT TO DANGERS. NEVERTHELESS, ISRAELS EMISSARIES WILL GO TO PEACE CONFERENCE SOBERLY, WHOLEHEARTEDLY, AND COURAGEOUSLY. WE SHALL LET NO-ONE TAKE THE NAME OF PEACE IN VAIN. WE SHALL NOT CEASE TO STRIVE FOR A FULL PEACE-IN SIMPLE SENSE OF TERM-A PEACE TO END WARS, WHICH WILL OPEN UP BRIGHT PROSPECTS FOR UNDISTURBED DEVELOPEMTN OF A LIFE OF CREATIVE PROGRESS FOR EACH AND EVERY ONE OF PEOPLES AND STATES IN MIDDLE EAST.

the same problem                        with President Asad as I didnamely                        that he wants prior agreement on SyrianIsraeli disengagement before sending                        a

Secretary General regarding the parties agreeing to attend the                        conference be revised so Egypt can attend the conference in any caseFahmy also insists on staying with the original language about UN auspices in the last sentence of paragraph                        onenamely The conference should be convened under the auspices of the                        United

KISSINGER AND GENEVA: (A) MARIV COMMENTS: ""THE CONVENING OF THE CONFERENCE AT GENEVA IS IN ITSELF AN ACHIEVEMENT FOR DR. KISSINGER.

SUMMARY: KING HUSUEIN INTERVIEW WITH LEIMONDE CORRESPONDENT AND LORIENT-LE JOUC EDITOR EDOUARD SAAB APPEARED HERE IN LORIENT AND AN NAHAR DEC 11.  KING REITERATED GOJ INTENTION NOT TO ATTEND GENEVA PEACE TALKS IF EGYPT AND SYRIA FAIL TO ""CLARIFY"" ALGIERS SUMMIT CONFERENCES ""EQUIVOCAL DECISION"" (I.E., RECOG- NITION OF PLO AS SOLE REP OF PALESTINIANS) TO JORDANS SATISFACTION.  MUCH OF INTERVIEW CONSISTED OF SENTIMENTS SIMILAR TO THOSE REPORTED AMMAN 6522 AND PREVIOUS. HOWEVER, IN CONTRAST TO HIS RECENT ""NONCHALANT"" ATTITUDE RE PROSPECT THAT EAST AND WEST BANKS MIGHT BECOME SEPARATED, KING SPOKE HEATEDLY AND AT LENGTH ON HISTORICAL AND GEORGRAPHICAL UNITY OF TWO BANKS AND DEBT WHICH PALESTINE CAUSE OWES TO HASHEMITES. HE EQUIVOCATED WHEN ASKED IF HE RETAINED CONFIDENCE IN JORDANS RELATIONSHIP WITH U.S.  FOLLOWING IS CONFIDENTIAL PRECIS OF KINGS MOST SIGNIFICANT REMARKS.  END SUMMARY.\n2. VEIPEACE TALKS: KING SAID GOJ HAD BEEN INFORMED OF CERTAIN ""PROCEDURAL DETAILS"" FOR GENEVA CONFERENCE, BUT THAT IT HAD NOT YET BEEN FORMALLY INVITED TO ATTEND.  IN ANY EVENT, HE SAID, JORDANIAN PARTICIPATION WOULD DEPEND ON WHETHER OTHER ARAB GOVTS., NOTABLY SYRIA AND EGYPT, COULD SATISFACTORILY ""CLARIFY"" ALGIERS SUMMITS ""EQUIVOCAL DECISION"" TO RECOGNIZE PLO AS SOLE PALESTINIAN REP.  ""BEFORE GOING TO GENEVA, WE MUST COORDINATE OUR POLICY AND ALL OUR INITIATIVES WITH EGYPT AND SYRIA.  WE MUST KNOW WHY WE ACCEPT NEGOTIATIONS, OR WHY WE REFUSE THEM, AND WE MUST UNDERSTAND BOTH THE REASONS FOR OUR CHOICE AND THE CONSEQUENCES THAT WILL FLOW FROM THAT CHOICE.""\n3. PLO-GOJ RELATIONS: KING MOCKED PLO CLAIM TO SPEAK FOR ALL PALESTICIANS, NOTED GOJ HAD ALWAYS REFRAINED FROM MAKING SUCH SWEEPING CLAIM, FOR ITSELF, AND INSISTED QUESTION OF SOLE REPRESENTIVITY COULD ONLY BE DECIDED BY REFERENDUM FOLLOWING ISRAELI WITHDRAWAL FROM OCCUPIED TERRITORIES.  AT SAME TIME, HE SAID GOJ WAS  WILLING CONSIDER ANY AND ALL PROPOSALS FOR INTE- GRATION OF REPS ""OF ALL POLITICAL CURRENTS WITHIN PALESTINE RESISTANCE"" IN JORDANIAN DELEGATION AT GENEVA.  ASKED IF THIS IS REALISTIC POSSIBILITY IN VIEW OF PAST GOJ-FEDAYEEN RELATIONS, KING REPLIED: ""I ENVISAGE AN ASSOCIATION FOR BETTER OR WORSE.  WHY NOT FORGET THE PAST, SINCE RESPONSIBILITY FOR EVENTS OF SEPTEMBER (1970) WAS AT LEAST SHARED.  AS MATTER OF FACT, THOSE ARMED CLASHES NEVER OPPOSED MUR TWO PEOPLES, BUT WERE BETWEEN A GOVT. THREATENED WITH DESTRUCTION AND ANARCHIST GROUPS WHICH WERE AT ODDS AMONG THEMSELVES AND DID NOT KNOW WHAT THEY WANTED"".\n4. FUTURE STATUS OF WEST BANK: AFTER REITERATING HIS PROMISE TO ACCORD SELF-DETERMINATION TO WEST BANK PALESTINIANS FOLLOWING ISRAELI WITHDRAWAL, KING NOTED HEATEDLY THAT ""NO ONE CAN DENY WHAT HASPEMITES HAVE DONE FOR PALESTINE SINCE BEGINNING OF THIS CENTURY. CONFIDENTIAL WE HAVE GIVEN EVERYTHING IN LIVES AND TREASURE, AND ON THIS SUBJECT WE TAKE NO LESSONS FROM ANYONE.\n5. OCTOBER WAR: AFTER DEFENDING JORDANS ROLE IN OCTOBER WAR ON GROUNDS THAT OVERRIDING NEED TO DEFEND EAST JORDAN WITH LIMIED MEANS LEFT GOJ WITH ONLY LIMITED MILITARY POTENTIAL, KING NOTED EGYPT AND SYRIA HAD NEVER INFORMED HIM THAT FIGHTING WOULD BEGIN ON OCT. 6 OR ANY OTHER DATE.  SAID THAT IN HIS CAIRO TALKS WITH SADAT AND ASSAD IN EARLY SEPTEMBER, ""WE TALKED ABOUT EVERYTHING EXCEPT WAR . . . NOT ONE WORD ABOUT H-HOUR FOR THE BATTLE"".  KING ALSO DENIGRATED FEDAYEEN MILITARY PERFORMANCE DURING OCTOBER FIGHTING, POINTING OUT HIS REFUSAL TO ALLOW COMMANDOS TO TRANSIT EAST JORDAN STEMMED FROM BELIEF THAT ""ONLY PLACE FOR FEDAYEEN ON BATTLEFIELD WAS INSIDE PALESTINE"" AND THAT THEY HAD MADE NO CONTRIBUTION IN THIS RESPECT.\n6. RELATIONS WITH U.S.: ASKED IF HE WAS SATISFIED WITH EVOLUTION IN JORDAN(S RALATIONSHIP WITH U.S., KING RESPONDED COLDLY: ""WE PUT OUR CONFIDENCE IN NO ONE.  WE ARE NOT SATISFIED WITH ANYBODYS ATTITUDE, AND OUR INITIATIVES ARE DICTATED BY OPPOR- TUNITIES AS THEY ARISE.  RELATIONS BETWEEN COUNTRIES ARE NEVER STABLE, AND WE MUST ACCOMMODATE OURSELVES TO THE REQUIREMENTS OF (VARIOUS) CIRCUMSTANCES"".\n7. E E E E E E E E\n",687467

SUMMARY. YAR PRESIDENT EXPRESSES GRATIFICATION WITH US ECONOMIC ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS. CRITICIZES\n2. I CALLED ON PRESIDENT IRYANI DECEMBER 23 TO PAY RESPECTS FOR FORTHCOMING MOSLIM HOLIDAY. THIS BEING ALSO APPROXIMATELY THE ONE YEAR ANNIVERSARY OF MY PRESEN- TATION OF CREDENTIALS, I DELIVERED TO PRESIDENT A LETTER SUMMARIZING PROGRESS MADE IN U.S. ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS, DIRECT AND INDIRECT. I WARMLY PRAISED COOPERATION RECEIVED FROM YEMENI OFFICIALS PRINCIPALLY CONCERNED WITH DEVELOPMENT MATTERS AND EXPRESSED HOPE THAT WHATEVER    SECRET\n3. PRESIDENT EXPRESSED APPRECIATION FOR U.S. ASSISTANCE, NOTING WITH A SMILE AN ARAB PROVERB THAT QUOTE SUCCESS IS THE KEY TO MORE UNQUOTE. SAID HE REALIZED NEED FOR CONTINUITY IN DEVELOPMENT MINISTRIES AND INTENDED RETAIN KEY OFFICIALS IN PRESENT JOBS INDEFINITELY.\n4. PRESIDENT SWITCHED QUICKLY TO SUBJECT MOST ON HIS MIND: SECRETARY KISSINGERS VISIT TO MIDDLE EAST; GENEVA CONFERENCE AND PROSPECTS FOR PEACE. OBVIOUSLY REFLECTING HIS DISCUSSION THREE DAYS EARLIER WITH SYRIAN FONMIN KHADDAM (SANAA 2424), HE COMMENTED THERE COULD BE NO LASTING PEACE IN MIDDLE EAST THAT DID NOT TAKE INTO ACCOUNT CONCERNS OF SYRIA AND THE PALESTINIANS.\n5. I REPLIED THAT SYRIAS REFUSAL GO TO GENEVA MUCH TO BE REGRETTED.  IT SEEMED THAT SYRIA  STILL TRYING TO PLAY THE OLD GAME OF SEEKING COMMITMENT ON CONCESSIONS PRIOR TO NEGOTION. USG COMMITTED TO WORK FOR IMPLEMENTATION OF RESOLUTION 242 IN CONTEXT OF A NEGOTIATION. GENEVA WAS THE ARENA IN WHICH SYRIA COULD PRESS ITS INTERESTS. IF IT DID NOT GO, IT WAS UNLIKELY THESE INTERESTS WOULD BE ADVANCED. SADAT HAS APPRECIATED THIS FACT AND HAD GOTTEN OUT OF THE INITIAL MEETINGS ESTABLISHMENT OF A MILITARY WORKING GROUP TO STUDY DISENGAGEMENT OF FORCES. YEMENI RELATIONS WITH SYRIA WERE CLOSE AND I HOPED YEMEN WOULD USE ITS INFLUENCE IN EFFORT PERSUADE SYRIA TO JOIN.\n6. PRESIDENT SAID HE HAD TALKED TO KHADDAM IN THIS SENSE. HOWEVER, KHADDAM HAD SAID DR. KISSINGER HAD HELD OUT LITTLE HOPE FOR ISRAELI WITHDRAWAL IN GOLAN AND THUS SYRIA HAD DECIDED TI NOT WORTHWHILE TAKE THE DOMESTIC POLITICAL RISKS OF ATTENDANCE AT GENEVA. IF GENEVA DISCUSSIONS PRODUCED SOME FIRST STEPS IN ISRAELI WITHDRAWAL, SYRIA MIGHT BE PERSUADED RECONSIDER. YARG WOULD CONTINUE WORK AT THIS. (PRESIDENTIAL POLITICAL ADVISER) NUMAN SEEING KHADDAM IN DAMASCUS    SECRET\n7. PRESIDENT SAID PEACE IN MIDDLE EAST, WHICH ALL SENSIBLE ARABS WANTED, ONLY ACHIEVABLE BY CONTINUED U.S. LEADER- SHIP AND USE OF U.S. LEVERAGE ON ISRAEL. IN THIS REGARD, ARABS FELT IT UNFORTUNATE THAT JUST AS NEGOTIATIONS BEGINNING U.S. PROVIDING ISRAEL WITH MORE THAN TWO BILLION DOLLARS IN NEW MILITARY ASSISTANCE. THIS NOT LIKELY INDUCE ISRAELI FLEXIBILITY IN NEGOTIATION.\n8. I REPLIED THAT U.S. SUPPORT OF ISRAEL IS A FACT, BUT SO IS OUR DESIRE FOR FRIENDSHIP WITH ARABS. NO SINGLE ARMS OR AID TRANSACTION WILL DETERMINE THE OUT- COME OF NEGOTIATIONS. THAT IS A FUNCTION OF U.S. SUSTAINED DETERMINATION AND COMMITMENT TO THE SEARCH FOR AN EQUITABLE PEACE, AND OF ALL PARTIES WILLINGNESS COMPROMISE REALISTICALLY. DR. KISSINGERS TWO VISITS TO THE MIDDLE EAST REFLECTED USGS COMMITMENT AND DETERMINATION.\n9. PRESIDENT AGREED. HE SAID HE WAS VERY MUCH CONCERNED, HOWEVER, THAT RUSSIA PLAYING AN OPPORTUNISTIC GAME TO EXPAND TIS INFLUENCE IN AREA. IF U.S. ABLE BRING SYRIA AND PALESTINIANS INTO NEGOTIATIONS AND IF PEACE WERE ATTAINED, THIS DANGER WIOULD BE AVERTED. ARABS WANTED AMERICAN FRIENDSHIP.  WITH PEACE, ARAB STATES QUOTE FROM MOROCCO TO GULF WILL BE WITH YOU UNQUOTE.\n0.

SAUDI ROYAL COUNSELOR KAMAL ADHAM, WHOM I HAD KNOWN IN SAUDI ARABIA, ARRIVED CAIRO MONDAY AFTERNOON.  YES- TERDAY HE WENT WORD THROUGH SAUDI AMBASSADOR FUAD NAZIR THAT HE WOULD LIKE TO HAVE A TALK WITH ME.  I SPENT AN HOUR WITH HIM LAST EVENING WITH NAZIR ALSO PRESENT. KAMALS PURPOSE SEEMED TO BE TO PRESENT VARIOUS ""KAMALISMS"" WHICH HE WANTED TO BE SURE USG UNDERSTANDS. SPECIFICALLY:\n2.  EGYPTIAN-SAUDI RELATIONS: DESPITE PAST STRAINS, SAUDI-EGYPTIAN RELATIONS ARE NOW GOOD.  FEISAL AND SADAT HAVE CLOSE PERSONAL RRELATIONSHIP.  FEISAL, WHOM SADAT CONSULTS FREQUENTLY, HAS CONSIDERABLE INFLUENCE ON THE PRESIDENT.  SO MUCH SO, IN FACT, THAT VARIOUS ""HIGH PEOPLE"" (UNIDENTIFIED) AROUND SADAT, WHO BELIEVE THEIR VIEWS HAVE NOT BEEN GIVEN A FAIR HEARING BY THE PRESIDENT, APPEAL TO FEISAL TO INTERVENE WITH SADAT IN SUPPORT OF THEIR VIEWS.  THOUGH SELECTIVE, FEISAL DOES SO WHEN HE THINKS IT DESIRABLE.  SADAT, ACCORDING TO ADHAM, USUALLY DEFERS TO FEISALS WISHES.    SECRET  3.  FEISALS POSITION:  FEISAL IS CURRENTLY AT THE PEAK OF HIS INFLUENCE, BOTH AT HOME AND IN ARAB WORLD.  HE IS CONSCIOUS OF THIS NEW STATURE AND WISHES DO NOTHING TO UNDERMINE IT.  THOUGH HE FEELS THAT HIS COUNSEL WAS FOR YEARS IGNORED BY USG AND ATTRIBUTES RECENT DETERIORATION IN MIDDLE EAST SITUATION AND US-ARAB RELA- TIONS TO THIS, HE IS ANXIOUS RETAIN GOOD RELATIONS WITH THE UNITED STATES.  HE HAS CONSTANTLY MADE THIS CLEAR AND IS PREPARED DO SO AGAIN.  HOWEVER, HE WILL NOT ACT IN A MANNER WHICH COMPROMISES HIS CURRENT PRESTIGE. IN SOLICITING FEISALS ASSISTANCE, USG SHOULD BEAR THIS IN  MIND.\n4.  JERUSALEM:  DESPITE OCCASIONAL PUBLIC STATEMENT TO THE CONTRARY, FEISAL NO LONGER ADAMANT ON RETURN OF WEST BANK TO JORDAN.  ACCORDING ADHAM, HIS SOLE CONCERN AT THE MOMENT IS THAT IN ANY FINAL SETTLEMENT JERUSALEM NOT RPT NOT BE UNDER ISRAELI SOVEREIGNTY. THIS COULD EMBRACE SOME KIND OF INTERNATIONALIZATION OF FORMERLY JORDANIAN-HELD JERU- SALEM.  SUCH INTERNATIONALIZATION NEED NOT INCLUDE NEW JERUSALEM, SINCE DOING SO WOULD BRING IN LARGE NUMBER OF ISRAELIS.\n5.  PALESTINIANS:  THOUGH HUSSEIN UPSET AT RECENT AL- GIERS SUMMIT RECOGNITION OF PALESTINIANS, WHICH FEISAL ENDORSED, JORDANIAN KING HAS NO RIGHT TO BE SO.  FEISAL HAD URGEED HIM TO ATTEND ALGIERS CONFERENCE. IN COM- MENTING ON CURRENT STRAINS, ADHAM RECALLED SAUDIS AND HASHEMITES HAVE LONG HISTORY OF MUTUAL SUSPICION.  HE ARGUED THAT WHILE FEISAL HAS IN PAST FEW YEARS SOUGHT TO IMPROVE RELATIONS WITH HUSSEIN AND TO ASSIST HIM FINANCIALLY, FEISAL IS IN FACT  ""FLEXIBLE"" ON JORDANIAN QUESTION.  PALESTINIANS SHOULD HAVE OPTION OF GOING THEIR OWN WAY OR STAYING WITH HUSSEIN.\n6.  US-EGYPTIAN RELATIONS:  FEISAL HAS BEEN HELPFUL IN URGING SADAT(A) TO AVOID TYING HIMSELF COMPLETELY TO THE SOVIETS, AND (B) TO IMPROVE HIS RELATIONS WITH    SECRET  USG.  ADHAM ASSERTED SADAT WANTS BETTER RELATIONS WITH USG, BUT BELIEVES SOME OF HIS ADVANCES HAD BEEN UN- REQUITED.  RECENT ANNOUNCEMENT OF AGREEMENT IN PRIN- CIPLE TO RESUME DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS AT AN EARLY DATE AND MY ARRIVAL HERE WERE BOTH POSITIVE STEPS.  ADHAM HOPED USG WOULD CONTINUE TO SEIZE OPPORTUNITIES TO STRENGTHEN SADAT AND SUPPORT HIM.  SADAT IS A ""MODERATE,"" AND STRENGTHENED AMERICAN RELATIONS WITH HIM WOULD BE BENEFICIAL NOT ONLY TO USG BUT ALSO TO ANTI- SOVIET STATES IN MIDDLE EAST AREA.\n7.  SYRIA:  ONLY FOUR STATES IN MIDDLE EAST AREA THAT NOW COUNT ARE EGYPT, ALGERIA, SAUDI ARABIA AND SYRIA.  ALGERIA COMING AROUND.  SYRIA, HOWEVER, CON- TINUES TO BE DIFFICULT.  ITS UNWILLINGNESS ATTEND PEACE CONFERENCE WITHOUT PRIOR AGREEMENT ON DISENGAGEMENT IS LATEST EVIDENCE OF THIS.  ISRAELI DEMAND FOR LIST OF POWS CAPTURED BY SYRIANS AND IRC ACCESS TO THEM CER- TAINLY REASONABLE.  HE IMPLIED THAT HE KNEW SYRIAN RELUCTANCE TO COMPLY IS PROMPTED BY WHAT HE CALLED ""EMBARRASSMENT"" SHOULD ANY SUCH DISCLOSURE BE FORCED UPON THEM.  INITIALLY THERE HAD BEEN ABOUT 60-70 ISRAELI POWS CAPTURED BY SYRIANS.  ASSAD GOVERNMENT HAD FOOLISHLY ALLOWED MANY TO BE ELIMINATED.  NOW HE THOUGHT THERE WERE ONLY ABOUT 25 LEFT.  SYRIANS DO NOT WANT TO GIVE LIST OR ALLOW IRC ACCESS BECAUSE THIS WOULD EXPOSE THE LARGE NUMBERS THEY HAVE DONE AWAY WITH. MOREOVER, SYRIANS ARE CONCERNED THAT IMMEDIATE DIS- CLOSURE OF POW NUMBERS WOULD SO INFURIATE IS- RAELIS THAT ISRAELI-SYRIAN DISENGAGEMENT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE.  PERHAPS SOME WHAT HE CALLED ""PROPORTIONAL"" DISENGAGEMENT COULD BE WORKED OUT, I.E., IF ISRAELIS DISENGAGE CERTAIN KILOMETERAGE ON EGYPTIAN FRONT, A SIMILAR BUT PROPORTIONAL TOKEN WITHDRAWAL MIGHT TAKE PLACE ON SYRIAN FRONT.  THIS WOULD AT LEAST SAVE FACE FOR ASSAD AND MAKE IT EASIER FOR EGYPTIANS TO GO AHEAD. INTERESTINGLY, BOTH ADHAM AND NAZIR EXPRESSED SYMPATHY    SECRET  FOR ISRAELI VIEW THAT PAST SYRIAN ACTION ON GOLAN HEIGHTS JUSTIFIED ISRAELI BELIEF SYRIANS SHOULD NOT RETURN TO ALL OF GOLAN HEIGHTS. IF SYRIANS GOT QUNEITRA BACK, HE THOUGHT THIS WOULD SUFFICE.\n8.  OIL EMBARGO:  WHEN IMPOSING INITIAL EMBARGO, SAUDIS HAD BASED THEIR CALCULATION ON WRONG STATISTICS RE US PETROLEUM REQUIREMENTS.  HE CLAIMED THEY HAD NOT REALIZED HOW HEAVY THE BLOW WOULD BE.  FEISAL ALLEGEDLY DESIRES FIND SOME WAY OF EASING IT, BUT HAVING PUBLICLY GONE ON RECORD, HE CAN ONLY DO SO IF (A) SADAT ASKS HIM TO DO SO, OR (B) HE HAS SOME TANGIBLE DISENGAGEMENT ON WHICH TO PEG AN EASING.  ONCE THIS TAKES PLACE, SAUDIS WILL BE HELPFUL.\n9.  SAUDI ROYAL ADVISORS:  IN A FASHION THAT I HAVE HEARD SO OFTEN FROM SENIOR SAUDI OFFICIALS, ADHAM EXPRESSED CONCERN THAT VARIOUS PEOPLE AROUND THE KING--MENTIONING SAQQAF, YAMANI AND OTHERS--CLAIM THEY CAN INFLUENCE FEISAL TO EASE EMBARGO.  ADHAM SAID HE HOPED SECRETARY REALIZES THAT FEISAL ALONE WILL MAKE THIS DECISION IN THE LIGHT OF THE KINGS JUDGMENT OF THE SITUATION.  USG SHOULD NOT BE MISLED BY SOME OF THESE CLAIMS.  I TOLD ADHAM THAT I WAS SURE SECRETARY KNOWS THAT FEISAL, WHILE LISTENING TO THE VIEWS OF HIS ADVISORS, MAKES ULTIMATE DECISIONS HIMSELF ON BASIS OF HIS BEST JUDGMENT.  I TWITTED ADHAM THAT I RECALLED SUCH SITUATIONS WHERE EVEN HIS ""FINE COUNSEL"" HAD BEEN THUS IGNORED.  ADHAM LAUGHED AND AGREED.\n0.  COMMENT: ADHAM SEEMS TO HAVE EXCELLENT ENTREE TO SENIOR EGYPTIAN CIRCLES AND IS APPARENTLY USED AS AN UNOFFICIAL CHANNEL OF COMMUNICATIONS TO SADAT.  HIS PRINCIPAL CONTACT SEEMS TO BE PRESIDENTIAL ADVISOR ASHRAF MARWAN.  HIS RELATIONS WITH SAUDI AMBASSADOR NAZIR APPEAR TO BE GOOD.  THERE ARE UNCONFIRMED REPORTS LOCALLY THAT ADHAM IS ALSO INVOLVED IN VARIOUS LOCAL BUSINESS DEALS ALONG WITH SENIOR MEMBERS OF THE EGYPTIAN ESTABLISHMENT. KAMAL WAS EVASIVE ON HIS ITINERARY.  HOWEVER, WE NOTE HIS PERSONAL SECRETARY CAME BY USINT YESTERDAY TO OBTAIN A VISITORS VISA TO THE US FOR HIMSELF.    SECRET  EILTS\n",682423

ASSISTANT SECRETARY SISCO BRIEFED FRENCH AMBASSADOR FERNAND- LAURANT AND BRITISH AMBASSADOR HILDGARD SEPARATELY DEC. 22 SHORTLY BEFORE SECRETARY AND PARTY EMPLANED FOR HOME.  SISCO SAID SECRETARY REGRETTED NOT BEING ABLE TO DO THIS HIMSELF BUT PRESS OF BUSINESS PREVENTED IT.\n2. SISCO SAID CONFERENCE WENT PRETTY MUCH AS PLANNED AND AS WE EXPECTED. WE WERE DISAPPOINTED THAT THE SYRIANS DID NOT CHOOSE TO PARTICIPATE, BUT ON OTHER HAND THEIR ABSENCE PROBABLY  IMPROVED PROSPECT THAT CONFERENCE COULD FOCUS ON IMMEDIATE PROBLEMS THAT NEED TO BE SOLVED. IN THE FIRST DAYS PUBLIC SESSION, SPEECHES WERE OBVIOUSLY MAINLY FOR HOME CONSUMPTION. SISCO COMMENTED THAT OVERALL ATMOSPHERE HAD BEEN SOMETHING LESS THAN REAL WARMTH. ON PART OF EGYPTIANS IN PARTICULAR, ESPECIALLY GIVEN SYRIAN DECISION STAY AWAY, THERE HAD BEEN    SECRET  CONTINUING CONCERN AND WARINESS ABOUT VISIBLE CONTACT WITH ISRAELIS (SISCO DESCRIBED MINOR CONTRETEMPS ABOUT SEATING ARRANGEMENTS WHICH FORTUNATELY HAD BEEN QUICKLY RESOLVED). HOWEVER, ARABA AS AWELL AS ISRAELIS SEEMED TO REALIZE OPENING OF CONFERENCE WAS HISTORIC MOMENT AND PRESENTED OPPORTUNITY WHICH MUST NOT BE LOST.\n3. SISCO SAID MOST IMPORTANT RESULT OF CONFERENCE HAD BEEN REAL CONSENSUS THAT WAS ACHIEVED ON PLAN FOR ONGOING WORK OF CONFERENCE. AS CONSENSUS STATEMENT READ BY SYG INDICATED, THERE HAD BEEN AGREEMENT THAT CONFERENCE WOULD STAY IN SESSION,  AND THAT REPRESENTATIVES OF THE PARTICIPANTS WOULD REMAIN AVAILABLE AND IN TOUCH AT LEAST AT AMBASSADORIAL LEVEL. EGYPT- ISRAELI WORKING GROUP WOULD BE SET UP TO CONTINUE DISCUSSIONS ON DISENGAGEMENT AND SEPARATION OF FORCES. THIS WOULD BEGIN SOMETIME NEXT WEEK, AND  WOULD NOT WAIT FOR ISRAELI ELECTIONS. ALL THESE ARRANGEMENTS HAD BEEN WELL PREPARED IN ADVANCE IN PRIVATE DISCUSSIONS LAST EVENING AND THIS MORNING, SO THAT CONFERENCE WAS ABLE TO MEET THIS MORNING, WITH ALL THIS BUTTONED DOWN.\n4. BOTH BRITISH AND FRENCH AMBASSADORS ASKED IF SISCO FORESAW WORKING GROUP TALKS PROCEEDING ON SAME PATTERN AS KILOMETER\n5. BOTH BRITISH AND FRENCH ASKED WHETHER ANY WORK MIGHT BE  DONE ON OTHER ASPECTS WHILE EGYPT/ISRAELI DISENGAGEMENT TALKS UNDERWAY. SISCO SAID DOOR HAD BEEN LEFT OPEN FOR THIS, BUT THAT IT WOULD PROBABLY BE PREMATURE NOW. WE OURSELVES DID NOT PRESS  FOR ANYTHING LIKE THIS BECAUSE WE BELIEVE FIRMLY THAT STEP- BY-STEP APPROACH WAS BEST, AND ONCE CONCRETE PROGRESS HAD BEEN    SECRET  ACHIEVED ON GROUND, PSYCHOLOGICAL ATMOSPHERE OF CONFERENCE WOULD CHANGE, MAKING PROGRESS ON OTHER ISSUES MORE FEASIBLE. BRITISH ASKED WHETHER THIS HELD TRUE OF ISRAELI/JORDAN DISCUSSION AS WELL, AND SISCO REPLIED THAT ALTHOUGH WE HOPE SOMETHING WOULD GET STATTED ON JORDAN FRONT AS WELL, WOULD PROBABLY LAG SOMEWHAT BEHIND THE START OF EGYPT/ISRAELI TALKS.\n6.BOTH BRITISH AND FRENCH ASKED OUR ASSESSMENT OF SYRIA VIS-A-VIS CONFERENCE. SISCO SAID THAT OUR JUDGMENT WAS SYRIAN POSTURE WAS ONE OF WATCHFUL WAITING. DOOR HAD BEEN LEFT OPEN FOR THEM, AND OUR JUDGMENT WAS IF SOLID PROGRESS COULD BE MADE ON EGYPTIAN/ISRAELI DISENGAGEMENT, SYRIANS WOULD WANT TO COME IN AT SUBSEQUENT STAGE. ON QUESTION SOVIET ATTITUDE AT CONFERENCE, SISCO TOLD BOTH ENVOYS THAT IT WAS PROBABLY TOO EARLY TO DESCRIBE THIS DEFINITIVELY, ALTHOUGH THEY HAD BEEN COOPERATIVE IN PROCEDURAL PHRASE. AS CON- FERENCE PROCEEDED SOVIET INTENTIONS WOULD BE GIVEN THOROUGH- GOING TEST.\n7. FINALLY, IN RESPONSE TO QUESTION, SISCO CONFIRMED THAT ISSUE OF PALESTINIAN PARTICIPATION HAD NOT ARISEN.

meeting with President Asad It                        was the best meeting weve had so far He is more furious at Egypt than                        ever He told me Sadat is sending                        messages to him asking him not to worry because Egypt will never accept to                        disengage forces with Israel without Syria Asad says he knows Sadat is trying and that all arrangements for disengagements                        on the canal are about to be completedI spoke to him very frankly and perhaps harshly about the necessity of Syria                        attending the conference He was quite lenient about this and said that he                        does not believe in disengagement but total withdrawal all at once But he                        has decided to accept disengagement if it were applied to all fronts He                        said he is willing to go to Geneva if he can have assurances from the US                        that disengagement will take place on the Israeli Syrian borders He added                        that the only way to have this commitment would be to agree with you on the                        line to which disengagement would                        take placeIn telegram 6807 from Amman                            December 27 Graham reported                            that Rifai told him that Assad who had seemed more forthcoming than                            during his previous meeting with Hussein said that if a disengagement of forces on the                            SyrianIsraeli front could be negotiated in advance he would be willing                            to attend the Geneva Conference to formalize such disengagement and then                            would participate in the peace negotiations Rifai said that although                            the official Syrian position was that Israel had to withdraw from all                            territory occupied in 1967 he thought that at this stage Assad would                            be willing to allow Israel to continue to occupy that part of the Golan                            Heights that directly overlooked

IN CONVERSATION WITH USINTOFF DECEMBER 10, DEPUTY TASS DIRECTOR YEDRASHNIKOV ASKED POINTEDLY IF EGYPTIANS WERE PUTTING PRESSURE ON US TO ACHIEVE SOME FORM OF ISRAELI DISENGAGEMENT BEFORE OPENING OF PEACE CONFERENCE. YEDRASHNIKOV GAVE HIS ""PERSONAL"" OPINION THAT SOME MOVEMENT SHOULD OCCUR PRIOR TO DECEMBER 18; BUT HE THEN SAID HE DID NOT REALLY EXPECT THIS TO TAKE PLACE. REPLYING TO QUESTION, HE SAID THE SOVIETS THEMSELVES WERE EXPERIENCING CONSIDERABLE CRITICISM FROM EGYPTIANS. SOME OF THESE, TRADITIONALLY FRIENDLY TO THE USSR, HAD BEEN SNIPING AT SOVIETS FOR THEIR INABILITY TO PRESS US TO PRESS ISRAEL TO DISENGAGE. FOR THEIR PART, SOVIETS FOUND IT DIFFICULT TO MOLLIFY EGYPTIANS BY NOTING VAST AMOUNT OF SOVIET    SECRET     MILITARY AND ECONOMIC ASSISTANCE PROVIDED TO EGYPT IN THE PAST FEW MONTHS; AND EGYPTIANS CONTINUE TO DEMAND MORE POLITICAL ASSISTANCE AS WELL AS MILITARY EQUIPMENT.\n2. ON CURRENT TACTICAL SITUATION, YEDRASHNIKOV SAID THERE WAS ""DEFINITE INFORMATION"" THAT EGYPT HAD UNDERTAKEN DELIBERATE POLICY OF HARASSING IDF, PARTICULARLY ISRAELI FORCES ON WEST BANK OF CANAL (WHICH HE SAID NUMBERED 18,000). HE SAID EGYPTIANS DO NOT BELIEVE THIS WOULD ELICIT A RETALIATORY RESPONSE, AND THEY SEEM QUITE PREPARED TO INCREASE NUMBER OF INCIDENTS AND COMMANDO RAIDS IN ISRAEL SALIENT. YEDRASHNIKOV SAID THAT EGYPTIAN POSITION ON WESTERN EDGE OF SALIENT HAD BEEN REINFORCED BY FIRST ARMY WHICH ""DID NOT EXIST"" AT TIME OF WARS OUTBREAK. HE EXPLAINED THAT THERE HAD BEEN NO EFFECTIVE FIGHTING FORCE DURING OCTOBER WHICH WOULD BE CALLED A FIRST ARMY, BUT EGYPTIANS HAD BEEN ABLE TO FORM ONE SUBSEQUENTLY.\n3. USINTOFF ASKED YEDRASHNIKOV TO CLARIFY CERTAIN INCONSISTENCIES IN HIS EARLIER REMARKS ABOUT MIG-23S;SPECIFICALLY, WERE THEY SOVIET OR EGYPTIAN PILOTED? YEDRASHNIKOV REPLIED THAT, AS HE HAD TOLD USINTOFF SOME WEEKS AGO, EGYPTIANS HAD BEEN TRAINED INTO MIG-23S AND WERE CAPABLE OF FLYING THEM; BUT THAT MIG-23S CURRENTLY IN EGYPT WERE BEING PILOTED BY SOVIETS.

SAUDI ROYAL COUNSELOR KAMAL ADHAM, WHOM I HAD KNOWN IN SAUDI ARABIA, ARRIVED CAIRO MONDAY AFTERNOON.  YES- TERDAY HE WENT WORD THROUGH SAUDI AMBASSADOR FUAD NAZIR THAT HE WOULD LIKE TO HAVE A TALK WITH ME.  I SPENT AN HOUR WITH HIM LAST EVENING WITH NAZIR ALSO PRESENT. KAMALS PURPOSE SEEMED TO BE TO PRESENT VARIOUS ""KAMALISMS"" WHICH HE WANTED TO BE SURE USG UNDERSTANDS. SPECIFICALLY:\n2.  EGYPTIAN-SAUDI RELATIONS: DESPITE PAST STRAINS, SAUDI-EGYPTIAN RELATIONS ARE NOW GOOD.  FEISAL AND SADAT HAVE CLOSE PERSONAL RRELATIONSHIP.  FEISAL, WHOM SADAT CONSULTS FREQUENTLY, HAS CONSIDERABLE INFLUENCE ON THE PRESIDENT.  SO MUCH SO, IN FACT, THAT VARIOUS ""HIGH PEOPLE"" (UNIDENTIFIED) AROUND SADAT, WHO BELIEVE THEIR VIEWS HAVE NOT BEEN GIVEN A FAIR HEARING BY THE PRESIDENT, APPEAL TO FEISAL TO INTERVENE WITH SADAT IN SUPPORT OF THEIR VIEWS.  THOUGH SELECTIVE, FEISAL DOES SO WHEN HE THINKS IT DESIRABLE.  SADAT, ACCORDING TO ADHAM, USUALLY DEFERS TO FEISALS WISHES.    SECRET  3.  FEISALS POSITION:  FEISAL IS CURRENTLY AT THE PEAK OF HIS INFLUENCE, BOTH AT HOME AND IN ARAB WORLD.  HE IS CONSCIOUS OF THIS NEW STATURE AND WISHES DO NOTHING TO UNDERMINE IT.  THOUGH HE FEELS THAT HIS COUNSEL WAS FOR YEARS IGNORED BY USG AND ATTRIBUTES RECENT DETERIORATION IN MIDDLE EAST SITUATION AND US-ARAB RELA- TIONS TO THIS, HE IS ANXIOUS RETAIN GOOD RELATIONS WITH THE UNITED STATES.  HE HAS CONSTANTLY MADE THIS CLEAR AND IS PREPARED DO SO AGAIN.  HOWEVER, HE WILL NOT ACT IN A MANNER WHICH COMPROMISES HIS CURRENT PRESTIGE. IN SOLICITING FEISALS ASSISTANCE, USG SHOULD BEAR THIS IN  MIND.\n4.  JERUSALEM:  DESPITE OCCASIONAL PUBLIC STATEMENT TO THE CONTRARY, FEISAL NO LONGER ADAMANT ON RETURN OF WEST BANK TO JORDAN.  ACCORDING ADHAM, HIS SOLE CONCERN AT THE MOMENT IS THAT IN ANY FINAL SETTLEMENT JERUSALEM NOT RPT NOT BE UNDER ISRAELI SOVEREIGNTY. THIS COULD EMBRACE SOME KIND OF INTERNATIONALIZATION OF FORMERLY JORDANIAN-HELD JERU- SALEM.  SUCH INTERNATIONALIZATION NEED NOT INCLUDE NEW JERUSALEM, SINCE DOING SO WOULD BRING IN LARGE NUMBER OF ISRAELIS.\n5.  PALESTINIANS:  THOUGH HUSSEIN UPSET AT RECENT AL- GIERS SUMMIT RECOGNITION OF PALESTINIANS, WHICH FEISAL ENDORSED, JORDANIAN KING HAS NO RIGHT TO BE SO.  FEISAL HAD URGEED HIM TO ATTEND ALGIERS CONFERENCE. IN COM- MENTING ON CURRENT STRAINS, ADHAM RECALLED SAUDIS AND HASHEMITES HAVE LONG HISTORY OF MUTUAL SUSPICION.  HE ARGUED THAT WHILE FEISAL HAS IN PAST FEW YEARS SOUGHT TO IMPROVE RELATIONS WITH HUSSEIN AND TO ASSIST HIM FINANCIALLY, FEISAL IS IN FACT  ""FLEXIBLE"" ON JORDANIAN QUESTION.  PALESTINIANS SHOULD HAVE OPTION OF GOING THEIR OWN WAY OR STAYING WITH HUSSEIN.\n6.  US-EGYPTIAN RELATIONS:  FEISAL HAS BEEN HELPFUL IN URGING SADAT(A) TO AVOID TYING HIMSELF COMPLETELY TO THE SOVIETS, AND (B) TO IMPROVE HIS RELATIONS WITH    SECRET  USG.  ADHAM ASSERTED SADAT WANTS BETTER RELATIONS WITH USG, BUT BELIEVES SOME OF HIS ADVANCES HAD BEEN UN- REQUITED.  RECENT ANNOUNCEMENT OF AGREEMENT IN PRIN- CIPLE TO RESUME DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS AT AN EARLY DATE AND MY ARRIVAL HERE WERE BOTH POSITIVE STEPS.  ADHAM HOPED USG WOULD CONTINUE TO SEIZE OPPORTUNITIES TO STRENGTHEN SADAT AND SUPPORT HIM.  SADAT IS A ""MODERATE,"" AND STRENGTHENED AMERICAN RELATIONS WITH HIM WOULD BE BENEFICIAL NOT ONLY TO USG BUT ALSO TO ANTI- SOVIET STATES IN MIDDLE EAST AREA.\n7.  SYRIA:  ONLY FOUR STATES IN MIDDLE EAST AREA THAT NOW COUNT ARE EGYPT, ALGERIA, SAUDI ARABIA AND SYRIA.  ALGERIA COMING AROUND.  SYRIA, HOWEVER, CON- TINUES TO BE DIFFICULT.  ITS UNWILLINGNESS ATTEND PEACE CONFERENCE WITHOUT PRIOR AGREEMENT ON DISENGAGEMENT IS LATEST EVIDENCE OF THIS.  ISRAELI DEMAND FOR LIST OF POWS CAPTURED BY SYRIANS AND IRC ACCESS TO THEM CER- TAINLY REASONABLE.  HE IMPLIED THAT HE KNEW SYRIAN RELUCTANCE TO COMPLY IS PROMPTED BY WHAT HE CALLED ""EMBARRASSMENT"" SHOULD ANY SUCH DISCLOSURE BE FORCED UPON THEM.  INITIALLY THERE HAD BEEN ABOUT 60-70 ISRAELI POWS CAPTURED BY SYRIANS.  ASSAD GOVERNMENT HAD FOOLISHLY ALLOWED MANY TO BE ELIMINATED.  NOW HE THOUGHT THERE WERE ONLY ABOUT 25 LEFT.  SYRIANS DO NOT WANT TO GIVE LIST OR ALLOW IRC ACCESS BECAUSE THIS WOULD EXPOSE THE LARGE NUMBERS THEY HAVE DONE AWAY WITH. MOREOVER, SYRIANS ARE CONCERNED THAT IMMEDIATE DIS- CLOSURE OF POW NUMBERS WOULD SO INFURIATE IS- RAELIS THAT ISRAELI-SYRIAN DISENGAGEMENT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE.  PERHAPS SOME WHAT HE CALLED ""PROPORTIONAL"" DISENGAGEMENT COULD BE WORKED OUT, I.E., IF ISRAELIS DISENGAGE CERTAIN KILOMETERAGE ON EGYPTIAN FRONT, A SIMILAR BUT PROPORTIONAL TOKEN WITHDRAWAL MIGHT TAKE PLACE ON SYRIAN FRONT.  THIS WOULD AT LEAST SAVE FACE FOR ASSAD AND MAKE IT EASIER FOR EGYPTIANS TO GO AHEAD. INTERESTINGLY, BOTH ADHAM AND NAZIR EXPRESSED SYMPATHY    SECRET  FOR ISRAELI VIEW THAT PAST SYRIAN ACTION ON GOLAN HEIGHTS JUSTIFIED ISRAELI BELIEF SYRIANS SHOULD NOT RETURN TO ALL OF GOLAN HEIGHTS. IF SYRIANS GOT QUNEITRA BACK, HE THOUGHT THIS WOULD SUFFICE.\n8.  OIL EMBARGO:  WHEN IMPOSING INITIAL EMBARGO, SAUDIS HAD BASED THEIR CALCULATION ON WRONG STATISTICS RE US PETROLEUM REQUIREMENTS.  HE CLAIMED THEY HAD NOT REALIZED HOW HEAVY THE BLOW WOULD BE.  FEISAL ALLEGEDLY DESIRES FIND SOME WAY OF EASING IT, BUT HAVING PUBLICLY GONE ON RECORD, HE CAN ONLY DO SO IF (A) SADAT ASKS HIM TO DO SO, OR (B) HE HAS SOME TANGIBLE DISENGAGEMENT ON WHICH TO PEG AN EASING.  ONCE THIS TAKES PLACE, SAUDIS WILL BE HELPFUL.\n9.  SAUDI ROYAL ADVISORS:  IN A FASHION THAT I HAVE HEARD SO OFTEN FROM SENIOR SAUDI OFFICIALS, ADHAM EXPRESSED CONCERN THAT VARIOUS PEOPLE AROUND THE KING--MENTIONING SAQQAF, YAMANI AND OTHERS--CLAIM THEY CAN INFLUENCE FEISAL TO EASE EMBARGO.  ADHAM SAID HE HOPED SECRETARY REALIZES THAT FEISAL ALONE WILL MAKE THIS DECISION IN THE LIGHT OF THE KINGS JUDGMENT OF THE SITUATION.  USG SHOULD NOT BE MISLED BY SOME OF THESE CLAIMS.  I TOLD ADHAM THAT I WAS SURE SECRETARY KNOWS THAT FEISAL, WHILE LISTENING TO THE VIEWS OF HIS ADVISORS, MAKES ULTIMATE DECISIONS HIMSELF ON BASIS OF HIS BEST JUDGMENT.  I TWITTED ADHAM THAT I RECALLED SUCH SITUATIONS WHERE EVEN HIS ""FINE COUNSEL"" HAD BEEN THUS IGNORED.  ADHAM LAUGHED AND AGREED.\n0.  COMMENT: ADHAM SEEMS TO HAVE EXCELLENT ENTREE TO SENIOR EGYPTIAN CIRCLES AND IS APPARENTLY USED AS AN UNOFFICIAL CHANNEL OF COMMUNICATIONS TO SADAT.  HIS PRINCIPAL CONTACT SEEMS TO BE PRESIDENTIAL ADVISOR ASHRAF MARWAN.  HIS RELATIONS WITH SAUDI AMBASSADOR NAZIR APPEAR TO BE GOOD.  THERE ARE UNCONFIRMED REPORTS LOCALLY THAT ADHAM IS ALSO INVOLVED IN VARIOUS LOCAL BUSINESS DEALS ALONG WITH SENIOR MEMBERS OF THE EGYPTIAN ESTABLISHMENT. KAMAL WAS EVASIVE ON HIS ITINERARY.  HOWEVER, WE NOTE HIS PERSONAL SECRETARY CAME BY USINT YESTERDAY TO OBTAIN A VISITORS VISA TO THE US FOR HIMSELF.    SECRET  EILTS\n",682423

SUMMARY:  YARG FONMIN NUMAN VIEWS ALGIERS CONFERENCES AS SUCCESS THAT LEAVES SADAT A FREE HAND TO CONFIDENTIAL NEGOTIATE IN GENEVA. NUMAN PARTICULARLY GRATIFIED BY CONFERENCES SUPPORT FOR CREATION OF PALESTINIAN ENTITY. HE BELIEVES PALESTINE REPRESENTATION IN GENEVA WILL BE USEFUL; PALESTINIANS CAN DO THEIR OWN TALKING AND OTHER ARAB GOVERNMENTS WILL NO LONGER BE HOSTAGE TO THEIR UNREALISTIC CLAIMS. SYRIANS ARE WOBBLY AND ASADS PERSONAL POSITION IS PRECARIOUS. IT WOULD BE WELL FOR USG SHOW SOME SOLICITUDE TO HELP THEM STAY IN THE GAME. NUMANS PERSONAL RECOMMENDATION IS SOME FORM OF MESSAGE FROM SECRETARY KISSINGER TO SYRIAN FONMIN KHADDAM.\n2. AMBASSADOR SAW DEPPRIMIN/FONMIN NUMAN EVENING NOVEMDIR 30 FOLLOWING RETURN OF YAR DELEGATION TO ALGIERS CONFERENCES.\n3. NUMAN THROUGHT ALGIERS CONFERENCES HAD BEEN VERY SUCCESSFUL. THEY HAD ACHIEVED HOPED-FOR RESULT OF LEAVING SADAT A FREE HAND TO NEGOTIATE IN GENEVA. SUMMIT ENDORSEMENT OF PALESTINE ENTITY, IN FAVOR OF WHICH NUMAN HAD SPOKEN ON THE FLOOR, INTENDED BE HELPFUL TO SADAT. WITH PALESTINIANS SPEAKING ONTHEIR OWN BEHALF IN GENEVA, OTHER ARAB LEADERS WOULD NO LONGER BE HOSTAGE TO THEIR UNREALISTICALLY EXTREME POSITIONS. IN FACE OF CALL FOR PALESTINIAN ENTITY, JORDANS CAPABLE ABDUL-MUNIM RIFAI HAD PLAYED IT COOL. AVOIDING ACRIMONIOUS DEBATE, HE HAD SIMPLY ASKED QUIETLY THAT RECORD SHOW GOJ RESERVED ITS POSITION.\n4. NUMAN GAVE BOUMEDIENNE A LOT OF THE CREDIT FOR SMOOTHNESS OF CONFERENCEDELIBERATIONS. BOUMEDIENNE, HE SAID, HAD SHOWN COMPLETE UNDERSTANDING AND SYMPATHY WITH SADATS OBJECTIVE OF AN HONORABLE, FINAL PEACE SETTLEMENT OBTAINED THROUGH NEGOTIATION. HE HAD WORKED CAPABLY BEHIND THE SCENES TO MAKE SURE THAT OTHER ARAB DIFFERENCES DID NOT INTERFERE WITH CENTRAL OBJECTIVE OF WINNING BROADEST SUPPORT FOR A POLITICAL SOLUTION.\n5. NUMAN SAID HIS ONLY WORRY WAS SYRIA. SYRIAN GOVERNMENT EXPOSED AND WOBBLY. ASADS POSITON VUL- NERABLE. SYRIA HAD IN GOOD FAITH THROWN EVERYTHING IT CONFIDENTIAL HAD INTO THE BATTLE WITH ISRAEL ONLY TO BE CALLED OFF BY A CEASE-FIRE ON WHICH IT HAD NOT BEEN CONSUL- TED. SINCE THE WAR, SYRIAN LOSSES HAD NOT BEEN FULLY MADE UP BY SOVIETS APPARENTLY IN BELIEF THIS WOULD KEEP SARG PLIABLE. SYRIAN REGIME MUCH MORE SENSITIVE TO IRAQI PRESSURES AND ACCUSATIONS THAN SADAT TO QADHAFI. THIS\n6. NUMAN REMARKED THAT ALGIERS CONFERENCES HAD ALSO BEEN USEFUL ON SOME PERIPHERAL ISSUES. HE AND KUWAITI FOREIGN MINISTER HAD JOINED IN CALLING FOR RESTORATION OF RELATIONS BETWEEN ARAB STATES WHERE SUCH RELATIONS DID NOT EXIST. SPECIFICALLY THEY HAD IN MIND ABSENCE OF RELATIONS BETWEEN (A) SAUDI ARABIA AND ABU DHABI AND (B) PDRY AND ABU DHABI AND OMAN. ALGIERS PROVIDED FURTHER OPPORTUNITY FOR QUIET DISCUSSION BET- WEEN FAISALS INTELLIGENCE ADVISER ADHAM AND ABU DHABI FOREIGN MINISTER SUWEIDI, WITH KUWAIT FOREIGN MINISTER IN THE MIDDLE, LOOKING TOWARD FORMULA FOR RESOLUTION OF DIFFERENCES BETWEEN FAISAL AND SHAIKH ZAYID.

SUMMARY.  IF SARG CONFIRMS REPORT FROM QUASI- OFFICIAL SYRIAN ARAB NEWS AGENCY THAT IT HAS DECIDED NOT TO PARTICIPATE IN GENEVA CONFERENCE, WE BELIEVE THAT THERE WILL BE MUCH BETTER THAN EVEN CHANCE OF EARLY SYRIAN RESUMPTION OF HOSTILTITIES,  FOR WHICH DAMASCUS IS NOW VERY EXTENSIVELY PREPARED.  SYRIAN AIM WOULD BE MAINLY POLITICAL, VIZ, TO FORCE ISRAEL TO ENTER PEACE CONFERENCE UNDER LESS FAVORABLE TERMS THAN NOW ARRANGED, BUT FIGHTING WOULD ALSO PLEASE SYRIAN HAWKS AND EASE    SECRET  ASADS DOMESTIC STRAINS.  IF SYRIA, RESUMED, WE BELIEVE EGYPT WOULD BE DRAWN IN ALMOST IMMEDIATELY.  SOVIETS WOULD BE UNLIKELY TO WARN-DAMASCUS BEFOREHAND THAT THEY WOULD NOT AID SYRIA IN THE EVENT THAT THE RESUMED HOSTILITIES WENT BADLY; AND, EVEN IF SOVIETS SO WARNED, SYRIANS WOULD PROBABLY NOT CONSIDER SUCH A THREAT CREDIBLE.  END SUMMARY.\n2.  AS WE ASSESS SYRIAN SITUATION, REGIME IS SUSPICIOUS THAT CEASEFIRE AND GENEVA CONFERENCE UNDER PRESENT ARRANGEMENTS AND AGENDA ARE ELEMENTS OF AN AMERICAN- ISRAELI MANEUVER TO FRUSTRATE ARAB EFFORT TO REGAIN OCCUPIED TERRITORIES, AND THAT UNILATERAL EGYPTIAN   ACCEPTANCE OF CEASEFIRE, EXCHANGE OF POWS WITHOUT DISENGAGEMENT, AND WILLINGNESS TO GO TO GENEVA SUGGEST EGYPTIAN READINESS TO CONCLUDE SEPARATE AGREEMENT WITH ISRAEL WITHOUT REGARD TO SYRIAN INTERESTS.  SYRIANS SEEM TO BELIEVE THAT THEIR ARMED FORCE  WERE NOT DEFEATED, LEARNED VALUABLE LESSONS IN OCTOBER, HAVE BEEN ADEQUATELY RESUPPLIED, AND NOW HAVE CAPABILIY TO INFLICT MORE DAMAGE IN ANOTHER ROUND.  ISRAELI REFUS*  TO COMPLY WITH CURRENT SYRIAN DEMANDS  BEARING  ON POSITION OF ISRAELIS IN OCCUPIED SYRIAN TERRITORIES HAS REINFORCED SYRIAN DISTRUST OF US WILLINGNES* TO ""DELIVER"" ISRA*L AT GENEVA AND *URTURED BELIEF THAT MILITARY OPTION MUST B *PURSUED UNTIL US HAS LEARNED THAT SYRIAN:DESIDERAT* CANNOT BE IGNORED.\n3.  ALTHOUGH WE HAVE NO REASON TO DOUBT SADATS GENUINE DESIRE FOR SUCCESS OF CONFERENCE, HE HAS SOME HAWKISH SENTIMENT TO CONTEND WITH IN HIS OWN ARMY, AND IN ANY CASE HE PROBABLY HAS VERY LITTLE LEVERAGE ON ASAD. IF MAJOR HOSTILITIES BREAK OUT ON GOLAN FRONT, WE SEE ALMOST NO POSSIBILITY THAT SUEZ FRONT COULD BE KEPT QUIET.  EGYPT WOULD BE SORELY TEMPTED TO SEEK TO EXPLOIT ISRAELI PREOCCUPATION WITH GOLAN FRONT, AND, IN FACT, IF SADAT CONCLUDES THAT ASADS DECISION TO GO TO WAR IS IRREVERSIBLE, HE MAY WELL RELUCTANTLY\n4.  SYRIAN INSISTENCE ON PRE-GENEVA COMPLIANCE BY ISRAEL WITH SYRIAN DISENGAGEMENT DEMANDS MAY MEAN THAT SYRIA IS OPPOSED ON PRINCIPLE TO PARTICIPATION IN ANY PEACE CONFERENCE WHOSE OUTCOME IS NOT PRE- DETERMINED IN ARAB FAVOR. BAATIST DOGMA AND PALISTINENIAN ASSOCIATIONS MAY HAVE LED REGIME TO PLAY ITS TRADITIONAL SPOILERS ROLE AND TO TRY TO SCUTTLE THE NEGOTIATING APPROACH .  OBJECT WOULD BE TO FORCE     ISRAEL TO CONFERENCE TABLE, AFTER NEW BATTLES, UNDER     MUCH GREATER INTERNATIONAL PRESSURE TO COMMIT ITSELF IN     ADVANCE TO WITHDRAW FROM VIRTUALLY ALL THE OCCUPIED     TERRITORIES.\n5.  SOVIETS HAVE BEEN URGING SYRIA TO GO TO GENEVA, PROBABLY ON ASSURANCE OF FIRM SOVIET SUPPORT FOR THEIR OBJECTIVES.  WE DOUBT, HOWEVER, THAT SOVIETS WOULD GO FURTHER TO WARN SYRIANS BEFOREHAND THAT RESORT TO WAR NOW WOULD ENTAIL LOSS OF SOVIET SUPPORT MILITARY SUPPORT EVEN IN EVENT SYRIANS FACED MAJOR DEFEAT. IF MOSCOW UNEXPECTEDLY TRIED SUCH A LINE, DAMASCUS WOULD PROBABLY JUDGE THAT SOVIETS ARE TOO DEEPLY COMMITTED TO ARABS TO CARRY OUT THREAT AND TO ABANDON THEIR PROTEGES IN TIME OF NEED, WITH CONSEQUENT GREAT DAMAGE TO SOVIET POSITION THROUGHOUT AREA.  \n6.  IN THESE CIRCUMSTANCES, RELATIVELY LITTLE OUTSIDE LEVERAGE IS AVAILABLE TO DISSUADE SYRIAN LEADERSHIP FROM ATTACK, IF THAT IS ITS INCLINAION, AS WE BELIEVE IT VERY PROBABLY IS.  INTERNALLY THE PRESSURES IN DAMASCUS ALL POINT TO RESUMED HOSTILITIES AS THE BEST OPTION TO ACHIEVE REGIME OBJECTIVES, BOTH AGAINST ISRAEL AND DOMESTIC RIVALS.  NUMEROUS REPORTS ATTEST    SECRET  TO THOROUGHGOING PREPARATIONS DURING LAST TEN DAYS FOR NEW BATTLE, AND WE BELIEVE ASAD WOULD WANT TO ACT BEFORE GENEVA CONFERENCE HAS ACTUALLY STARTED, SINCE HIS ABILI*Y TO DISRUPT PROCEEDINGS IS PROBABLY NOW AT MAXIMUM.  PRETEXT FOR NEW FIGHTING WILL NOT BE HARD TO MANUFACTURE, AND MOST OF ARAB WORLD IN ITS PRESENT MOOD WILL ACCEPT IT AS TRUE *  \n7.

95,0.9050271292152043,4252 Subject: Letter to the Secretary From Foreign Minister Fahmi Ref: Cairo 4245Dated December 29 not                            found1 I was called to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs at 1400 local today by                            Omar Sirri to receive a letter to                        the Secretary from the Foreign Minister Sirri told me that this letter was in effect a reply to                        President Nixons letter of December                        28 to President SadatDocument 422 and also                        the Secretarys letter to President SadatSee Document 423 but he left open the possibility that                        President Sadat might also reply                        directly about any new development regarding the basic issue raised in                        President Nixons letter2 Sirri made a special point of                        telling me that the Government of Egypt wanted to respond quickly to                        messages from the USG and in this                        particular case President Nixons                        letter and the Secretarys letter were both seen by President Sadat on Dec 29 and the response which we                        are transmitting at this time was prepared on the same date although it is                        dated Dec 30 1973 Sirri said that                        he made the trip from Aswan to Cairo for the sole purpose of delivering the                        response to me and he would be returning to Aswan tomorrow morning He did                        not know how much longer he and the Foreign Minister would be in Aswan3 The Foreign Ministers letter to the Secretary of State follows:Dear Mr Secretary of StateThis is to inform you that President Sadat has received President Nixons message of Dec 28 1973 This message referred                        inter alia to your reporting to the President regarding your talks with my                        President and in particular to the principles you have agreed upon                        concerning the disengagement problemPresident Nixon furthermore                        referred to the ceasefire and the six point agreement As you know the                        ceasefire is still fragile and while we have carried out all that was                        required from us under the six point agreement the Israelis on the other                        hand and up to this very minute have not implemented in good faith their                        obligation so far as item 2 of this agreement is concerned Moreover they                        are complicating the situation of the town of Suez which is supposed to be                        an open town refusing to supply Egyptian positions of the Third Army at                        Kabrit on the eastern bank of the canal while still holding 57 Egyptian                        prisoners of warIn spite of that Egypt went to the peace conference in the hope that a                        serious step be taken towards a disengagement agreement which after a long                        and protracted delay we expect to be concluded soon as President Nixon repeatedly promised and                        guaranteedAfter reporting to President Sadat                        on our talks in Geneva and on the proceedings of the conference he received                        President Nixons message which he                        carefully examined He took note with appreciation of President Nixons reference to the improvement in                        our bilateral relations and to his and President Sadats efforts to build a new basis for                        the common good and welfare and benefit of the area where we livePresident Sadat fully reciprocates                        President Nixons desire to set up                        this new relationship on frankness and directness He asked me to convey to                        you and through you to President Nixon that he took special notice of President Nixons personal pledge to do everything                        in his power to ensure that his second term as President will be remembered                        as the period in which the United States developed a new and productive                        relationship with Egypt and the Arab worldAs to President Nixons reference to                        the December 25 decision of the Arab Oil Ministers in Kuwait President                            Sadat authorized me to say that                        this decision was not meant in any way whatsoever to be discriminatory in                        relation to the US President Sadats feeling is that the Arab Oil Ministers while having in                        mind the direct and immediate impact of the embargo on the European                        countries were under the impression that the United States because of

SadatSee Document 423 but he left open the possibility that                        President Sadat might also reply                        directly about any new development regarding the basic issue raised in                        President Nixons letter2 Sirri made a special point of                        telling me that the Government of Egypt wanted to respond quickly to                        messages from the USG and in this                        particular case President Nixons                        letter and the Secretarys letter were both seen by President Sadat on Dec 29 and the response which we                        are transmitting at this time was prepared on the same date although it is                        dated Dec 30 1973 Sirri said that                        he made the trip from Aswan to Cairo for the sole purpose of delivering the                        response to me and he would be returning to Aswan tomorrow morning He did                        not know how much longer he and the Foreign Minister would be in Aswan3 The Foreign Ministers letter to the Secretary of State follows:Dear Mr Secretary of StateThis is to inform you that President Sadat has received President Nixons message of Dec 28 1973 This message referred                        inter alia to your reporting to the President regarding your talks with my                        President and in particular to the principles you have agreed upon                        concerning the disengagement problemPresident Nixon furthermore                        referred to the ceasefire and the six point agreement As you know the                        ceasefire is still fragile and while we have carried out all that was                        required from us under the six point agreement the Israelis on the other                        hand and up to this very minute have not implemented in good faith their                        obligation so far as item 2 of this agreement is concerned Moreover they                        are complicating the situation of the town of Suez which is supposed to be                        an open town refusing to supply Egyptian positions of the Third Army at                        Kabrit on the eastern bank of the canal while still holding 57 Egyptian                        prisoners of warIn spite of that Egypt went to the peace conference in the hope that a                        serious step be taken towards a disengagement agreement which after a long                        and protracted delay we expect to be concluded soon as President Nixon repeatedly promised and                        guaranteedAfter reporting to President Sadat                        on our talks in Geneva and on the proceedings of the conference he received                        President Nixons message which he                        carefully examined He took note with appreciation of President Nixons reference to the improvement in                        our bilateral relations and to his and President Sadats efforts to build a new basis for                        the common good and welfare and benefit of the area where we livePresident Sadat fully reciprocates                        President Nixons desire to set up                        this new relationship on frankness and directness He asked me to convey to                        you and through you to President Nixon that he took special notice of President Nixons personal pledge to do everything                        in his power to ensure that his second term as President will be remembered                        as the period in which the United States developed a new and productive                        relationship with Egypt and the Arab worldAs to President Nixons reference to                        the December 25 decision of the Arab Oil Ministers in Kuwait President                            Sadat authorized me to say that                        this decision was not meant in any way whatsoever to be discriminatory in                        relation to the US President Sadats feeling is that the Arab Oil Ministers while having in                        mind the direct and immediate impact of the embargo on the European                        countries were under the impression that the United States because of its                        resources was not that badly affectedHowever in view of the apparent difficult situation which President                            Nixon is facing in the light of                        the Dec 25 decision President Sadat                        will make immediate and appropriate contacts with King Faisal who received from President Nixon a similar message on the same

positions of the Third Army at                        Kabrit on the eastern bank of the canal while still holding 57 Egyptian                        prisoners of warIn spite of that Egypt went to the peace conference in the hope that a                        serious step be taken towards a disengagement agreement which after a long                        and protracted delay we expect to be concluded soon as President Nixon repeatedly promised and                        guaranteedAfter reporting to President Sadat                        on our talks in Geneva and on the proceedings of the conference he received                        President Nixons message which he                        carefully examined He took note with appreciation of President Nixons reference to the improvement in                        our bilateral relations and to his and President Sadats efforts to build a new basis for                        the common good and welfare and benefit of the area where we livePresident Sadat fully reciprocates                        President Nixons desire to set up                        this new relationship on frankness and directness He asked me to convey to                        you and through you to President Nixon that he took special notice of President Nixons personal pledge to do everything                        in his power to ensure that his second term as President will be remembered                        as the period in which the United States developed a new and productive                        relationship with Egypt and the Arab worldAs to President Nixons reference to                        the December 25 decision of the Arab Oil Ministers in Kuwait President                            Sadat authorized me to say that                        this decision was not meant in any way whatsoever to be discriminatory in                        relation to the US President Sadats feeling is that the Arab Oil Ministers while having in                        mind the direct and immediate impact of the embargo on the European                        countries were under the impression that the United States because of its                        resources was not that badly affectedHowever in view of the apparent difficult situation which President                            Nixon is facing in the light of                        the Dec 25 decision President Sadat                        will make immediate and appropriate contacts with King Faisal who received from President Nixon a similar message on the same subjectSee footnote 3 Document 422 and also with                        President BoumedienneIn this connection it is germane to indicate that during your talks with                        President Sadat it became apparent                        that an effort will be made to ease the embargo even so far as the US is                        concerned once the disengagement agreement is signed As promised President                            Sadat will do his best to see to                        it that this will be brought aboutIn concluding I hope that you for your part will be able to

Affairs at 1400 local today by                            Omar Sirri to receive a letter to                        the Secretary from the Foreign Minister Sirri told me that this letter was in effect a reply to                        President Nixons letter of December                        28 to President SadatDocument 422 and also                        the Secretarys letter to President SadatSee Document 423 but he left open the possibility that                        President Sadat might also reply                        directly about any new development regarding the basic issue raised in                        President Nixons letter2 Sirri made a special point of                        telling me that the Government of Egypt wanted to respond quickly to                        messages from the USG and in this                        particular case President Nixons                        letter and the Secretarys letter were both seen by President Sadat on Dec 29 and the response which we                        are transmitting at this time was prepared on the same date although it is                        dated Dec 30 1973 Sirri said that                        he made the trip from Aswan to Cairo for the sole purpose of delivering the                        response to me and he would be returning to Aswan tomorrow morning He did                        not know how much longer he and the Foreign Minister would be in Aswan3 The Foreign Ministers letter to the Secretary of State follows:Dear Mr Secretary of StateThis is to inform you that President Sadat has received President Nixons message of Dec 28 1973 This message referred                        inter alia to your reporting to the President regarding your talks with my                        President and in particular to the principles you have agreed upon                        concerning the disengagement problemPresident Nixon furthermore                        referred to the ceasefire and the six point agreement As you know the                        ceasefire is still fragile and while we have carried out all that was                        required from us under the six point agreement the Israelis on the other                        hand and up to this very minute have not implemented in good faith their                        obligation so far as item 2 of this

Campus troubles                        at this time of year have become                        traditional but disturbances this year seem more serious than those for the                        last several years End summaryBeginning several days ago and continuing on December 3 4 5 and 6 student                        demonstrations and other manifestations of dissidence have occurred at                        Tehran University Arya Mehr University and at Tehrans Polytechnic College                        Some roughing up of professors and fighting among student factions                        reportedly has occurred at Agricultural College at Karaj a branch of Tehran                        University Tehrans Polytechnic College was closed for ten days some                        reports say indefinitely beginning December 4 while two colleges of Tehran                        University are closed Further demonstrations are rumored for December 7                        with security authorities reportedly ready to deal harshly with                        participants Police have kept demonstrations well in hand and no mention of                        dissidence has so far appeared in Iranian media2 Timing of current unrest is related to 16 Azar 1341 corresponding this                        year to December 7 when security forces wounded many and killed three                        student demonstrators in Tehran Beginning about seven years ago university                        students especially in Tehran have marked the anniversary of their death                        with demonstrations As picked up from several sources student grievances                        this year include A lack of intellectual and political freedoms in Iran                        B corruption C growing disparity in wealth in Iran D high student                        fees and E GOI restrictions on size of                        university student population Mixed with these are more traditional student                        gripes over bad cafeteria food and inadequate professors3 Dr Ahmad Ghoreishi Dean of the Law School at Iranian National                        University which thus far has avoided trouble told an Embassy officer that                        student demonstrations this year may be worse than those in previous years                        Ghoreishi whose establishment credentials are impeccable sees lack of                        freedom of expression as the most basic student complaint The dilemma in                        Iran in his view is that the situation will gradually worsen unless the                        government relaxes its current strict controls while if it does ease                        restrictions there is risk that the situation will get out of hand such as                        occurred recently in GreeceIn a December 10                            meeting at Killgores home                            Ghoreishi agreed with the students: there is no freedom in this country                            and corruption is everywhere Some people make 50000 a day the Peykan                            automobile people and others dont have enough to eat Yet Killgore reported that when he visited                            Ghoreishi at the heavilyguarded university Ghoreishi claimed that all                            was quiet despite student agitation over cafeteria food Ghoreishis                            tone was indulgent while deprecating the political significance of                            student protest Quite surprisingly in view of statements directly to                            the contrary made six days earlier he said that the student troubles                            this year were less serious than those in past years Killgore concluded that Ghoreishi                            meant his initial remarks and was dissimulating in his office Ibid

dissidence However what is                        happening reminds us that with all of its many successes the Iranian regime                        has continued to fail to win the sympathy of its university studentsIn telegram 5111 from Tehran June 21 1974 the                            Embassy reported the largest student riots in 2 years at Pahlavi                            University in Shiraz ostensibly over grades although they took place                            on the anniversary of large riots in Tehran several years before at                            which some students were killed The Embassy concluded however that                            though Iranian student demonstrators often mask national political                            grievances in local university issues for reasons of safety we have no                            evidence to indicate that antiregime or antiUS feelings played a                            role in Shiraz riots Ibid Central Foreign

TIMING OF CURRENT UNREST IS RELATED TO 16 AZAR 1341 (CORRESPONDING THIS YEAR TO DECEMBER 7) WHEN SECURITY FORCES WOUNDED MANY AND KILLED THREE STUDENT DEMONSTRATORS IN TEHRAN.  BEGINNING ABOUT SEVEN YEARS AGO, UNIVERSITY STUDENTS, ESPECIALLY IN TEHRAN, HAVE MARKED THE ANNIVERSARY OF THEIR DEATH WITH DEMONSTRATIONS.  AS PICKED UP FROM SEVERAL SOURCES, STUDENT GRIEVANCES THIS YEAR INCLUDE (A) LACK OF INTELLECTUAL AND POLITICAL FREEDOMS IN IRAN; (B) CORRUPTION; (C) GROWING DISPARITY IN WEALTH IN IRAN; (D) HIGH STUDENT FEES; AND (E) GOI RESTRICTIONS ON SIZE OF UNIVERSITY STUDENT POPULATION.  MIXED WITH THESE ARE MORE TRADITIONAL STUDENT GRIPES OVER BAD CAFETERIA FOOD AND INADEQUATE PROFESSORS.\n3.  DR. AHMAD GHOREISHI, DEAN OF THE LAW SCHOOL AT IRANIAN NATIONAL UNIVERSITY, WHICH THUS FAR HAS AVOIDED TROUBLE, TOLD AN EMBASSY OFFICER THAT STUDENT DEMONSTRATIONS THIS YEAR MAY BE WORSE THAN THOSE IN PREVIOUS YEARS.  GHOREISHI, WHOSE ESTABLISHMENT CREDENTIALS ARE IMPECCABLE, SEES LACK OF FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION AS THE MOST BASIC STUDENT COM- PLAINT.  THE DILEMMA IN IRAN, IN HIS VIEW, IS THAT THE SITUATION WILL GRADUALLY WORSEN UNLESS THE GOVERNMENT RELAXES ITS CURRENT STRICT CONTROLS, WHILE IF IT DOES EASE RESTRICTIONS THERE IS RISK THAT THE SITUATION WILL GET OUT OF HAND, SUCH AS OCCURRED RECENTLY IN GREECE.\n4.

THE SANYA GOVERNMENT HAS ASSUMED EMERGENCY POWERS TO DEAL WITH THE OIL SHORTAGE UNDER ARTICLE 15 OF THE 1972 (REF B) INTERIM CONSTITUTION. THE PRIME MINISTER APPOINTED THE INDUSTRY MINISTER, THE GENERAL MANAGER OF THE ELECTRICAL GENERATING AUTHORITY OF THAILAND (EGAT), AND THE DIRECTOR GENERAL OF THE POLICE DEPARTMENT TO A BOARD WHICH WILL DESIGN AND OVERSEE VARIOUS CONSERVATION MEASURES. THE POLICE DEPARTMENT HAS ALREADY ANNOUNCED SHORTER BUSINESS HOURS FOR PUBLIC ENTERTAINMENT SPOTS COME THE NEW YEAR. EGAT HAS REDUCED VOLTAGE AROUND BANGKOK AND TURNED OFF SOME LIGHTS. PRIVATE BUSINESSES ARE EXPECTED TO FOLLOW SUIT. THE PRESS REPORTS THAT THE ROYAL STATE RAILWAY IS DUSTING OFF ITS STEAM ENGINES AND RETURNING THEM TO SERVICE. THE ASSUMPTION OF EMERGENCY POWERS GOES FAR IN CONVINCING THE PUBLIC THAT BOTH THE SITUATION AND THE GOVERNMENT ARE SERIOUS.\n2. THE KING PRESIDED OVER THE OPENING CEREMONIES OF THE NEWLY APPOINTED NATIONAL LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY (NLA) DECEMBER 28. THE PALACE ISSUED THE FORMAL LIST OF THE 299 NLA MEMBERS, DROPPING THE NAMES OF THE UNDER AGED WINNERS AND THUS AVOIDING CONTROVERSY (BANGKOK 19821). THE PRESS CARRIED CONSILIATORY QUOTES FROM THE THREE DROPPED NOMINEES TO THE EFFECT THAT THEY WERE PLEASED TO RECEIVE SO MANY VOTES BUT WOULD BOW TO THE CONSTITUTIONAL RESTRICTIONS. CONFIDENTIAL IN AN AFTERNOON SESSION DECEMBER 28, THE NLA ELECTED M.R. KUKRIT PRAMOJ AS ITS SPEAKER AND GENERAL SAMRAN PHAETAYAKUL AS THE FIRST DEPUTY SPEAKER.\n3. DR. PUEY UNGPHAKORN, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE BANGKOK BANK AND DEAN OF THE ECONOMICS FACULTY AT THAMMASAT UNIVERSITY, IS A POPULAR FAVORITE FOR FUTURE PRIME MINISTER. DESPITE HIS DENIALS OF POLITICAL AMBITION, MAJOR POLITICAL GROUP- INGS HINT THAT THEY WILL SUPPORT PUEY FOR PRIME MINISTER. SENI PRAMOTE, LEADER IN THE DISARRAYED DEMOCRATIC PARTY, WAS THE LATEST TO JOIN THE BANDWAGON. IN A RECENT PRESS INTERVIEW SENI ALSO EXPLAINED THAT THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY SHOULD CHANGE TO A MORE LIBERAL IMAGE, MAKING CLEAR ITS DESIRE FOR ""SOCIAL JUSTICE FOR THE PEOPLE.""\n4. DEFENSE MINISTER, AIR CHIEF MARSHAL DAWEE CHULLASAPYA, PROPOSED A ONE MONTH CEASEFIRE TO THE COMMUNIST TERRORISTS IN ORDER TO GIVE THEM AN OPPORTUNITY TO SURRENDER TO THE GOVERNMENT. AN AMNESTY IS ALSO PART OF THE DEAL. THE COMMUNIST SUPPRESSION OPERATIONS COMMAND IS PRESENTLY WORKING OUT THE DETAILS OF THE UNILATERAL CEASEFIRE WHICH IS CONTEMPLATED FOR EARLY\n4. WHILE IT IS UNLIKELY THAT ANY RANKING DEFECTIONS WILL OCCUR, THE RTG APPARENTLY FEELS THAT POLITICAL GAINS CAN BE MADE IN TAKING THE INITIATIVE (SEPTEL). THE PRESS HAS RECENTLY GIVEN PLAY TO INTERVIEWS WITH MUSLIM DISSIDENT LEADER, POR SU, SUGGESTING THAT HE WOULD ACCEPT AN AMNESTY OFFER. THIS INITIATIVE ALSO REFLECTS THINKING IN GOVERNMENT AND ACADEMIC CIRCLES THAT INEPT GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS AND GENERALLY POOR GOVERNMENT RELATIONS WITH THE POPULATION HAVE CAUSED THE INSURGENCY.\n5. THE STUDENT MOVEMENT INVOLVED ITSELF IN A NUMBER OF ECONOMIC ISSUES THIS PAST WEEK. JUST BEFORE THE GOVERNMENT FORMALLY ANNOUNCED IT HAD ASSUMED EMERGENCY POWERS, THE NATIONAL STUDENT CENTER OF THAILAND (NSCT) ISSUED A PRESS RELEASE WHICH STATED THAT IT WOULD SEND A LETTER TO THE PRIME MINISTER WITH SUGGESTIONS ON CONSERV- ING OIL. FIVE MAJOR STUDENT GROUPS RECENTLY ANNOUNCED THAT THEY OPPOSE THE DEVELOPMENT OF AN INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT AT NONG NGU HAO AS PROPOSED BY THE NORTHROP CONFIDENTIAL COMPANY. TH* STUDENT  AND SOME PUBLIC SECTORS WANT THE PROJECT DEBATED IN THE NLA. THE STUDENTS BACKED UP THEIR OPPOSITION WITH THE THREAT TO RELEASE THE*NAMES OF INDIVIDUALS WHO, THEY CLAIM, STA*D TO MAK* INORDINATE GAINS *F THE*PROJECT GOES*THROUGH./\n6. VARIOUS STUDENT GROUPS HAVE RECENTLY PRESSED FOR EDUCATIONAL REFORM. STUDENTS AT RAMKHAMHAENG UNIVERSITY OCCUPIED THE STATE UNIVERSITY DEGEAU (SUB) AND THE NEARBY COOPERATIVES PROMOTION, LAND DEVELOPMENT, AND AGRICULTURAL CONFIDENTIAL COOPERATIVES DEPARTMENTS. THEY DEMANDED THAT THE SUB FULFILL ITS EARLIER PROMISES TO ESTABLISH A SCIENCE FACILITY AT RAMKHAMHAENG, THE NEWEST UNIVERSITY. APPARENTLY RAMKHAMHAENG ENROLLED STUDENTS WITH THE EXPECTATION THIS YEAR THAT THE NEW FACULTY WOULD BE APPROVED. THE DEMON- STRATIONS SWELLED TO 3,000 OVER A THREE DAY PERIOD AND FINALLY DISPERSED AFTER ANOTHER SUB PROMISE THAT THE FACULTY WOULD BE ESTABLISHED. POLITICAL SCIENCE GRADUATE STUDENTS AT THAMMASAT UNIVERSITY HAVE PROTESTED THE COMPARATIVELY HIGH CREDIT HOUR FEES THEY PAY. CHULA- LONGKORN PHARMACY STUDENTS CLASS BOYCOTT SEEKING THE RESIGNATION OF THEIR DEAN RECEIVED ADDED SUPPORT FROM THE UNIVERSITY STUDENT COUNCIL.\n7. CHULALONGKORN UNIVERSITY AS ADMINISTRATOR OF THE CHULALONGKORN PROPERTY BUREAU, IS IN A DISPUTENYITH ITS 5028 TENANTS. THE TENANTS CHARGE THAT RENTAL FEES AND ""KICK BACKS"" ARE TOO HIGH. NEGOTIATIONS HAVE STALEMATED AND THE UNIVERSITY HAS CANCELLED NIGHT CLASSES AS A PRECAUTION AGAINST VIOLENCE. THE UNIVERSITY STUDENT COUNCIL IS FALLING BEHIND THE UNIVERSITY ADMIN- VYSTRATORS. THE TENANTS STAGED TWO DAYS OF PROTESTS IN FRONT OF GOVERNMENT HOUSE AND FINALLY DISPERSED AFTER SENDING A PETITION TO THE KING. IN THE PAST CHULALONGKORN STUDENTS HAVE EXPOSED SCANDALS INVOLVING THE UNIVERSITY PROPERTIES. THE THREAT OF VIOLENCE AND CLOSING OF THE NIGHT CLASS HAS PLACED THE STUDENTS ON THE ""ESTABLISHMENTS"" SIDE IN THIS DISPUTE.\n8. COLONEL NARONG KITTIKACHORN FLEW FROM GERMANY, BUT FAILING TO GAIN ENTRANCE TO JAPAN, FINALLY LANDED IN KOREA. INTERVIEWED AT THE SEOUL AIRPORT, NARONG SAID THAT HE IS TRYING TO SEEK ASYLUM IN PORTUGAL OR SWITZER- LAND. SO FAR THERE HAS BEEN NO DOMESTIC RESPONSE TO NARONGS ODYSSEY. KINTNER\n",685903

Campus troubles                        at this time of year have become                        traditional but disturbances this year seem more serious than those for the                        last several years End summaryBeginning several days ago and continuing on December 3 4 5 and 6 student                        demonstrations and other manifestations of dissidence have occurred at                        Tehran University Arya Mehr University and at Tehrans Polytechnic College                        Some roughing up of professors and fighting among student factions                        reportedly has occurred at Agricultural College at Karaj a branch of Tehran                        University Tehrans Polytechnic College was closed for ten days some                        reports say indefinitely beginning December 4 while two colleges of Tehran                        University are closed Further demonstrations are rumored for December 7                        with security authorities reportedly ready to deal harshly with                        participants Police have kept demonstrations well in hand and no mention of                        dissidence has so far appeared in Iranian media2 Timing of current unrest is related to 16 Azar 1341 corresponding this                        year to December 7 when security forces wounded many and killed three                        student demonstrators in Tehran Beginning about seven years ago university                        students especially in Tehran have marked the anniversary of their death                        with demonstrations As picked up from several sources student grievances                        this year include A lack of intellectual and political freedoms in Iran                        B corruption C growing disparity in wealth in Iran D high student                        fees and E GOI restrictions on size of                        university student population Mixed with these are more traditional student                        gripes over bad cafeteria food and inadequate professors3 Dr Ahmad Ghoreishi Dean of the Law School at Iranian National                        University which thus far has avoided trouble told an Embassy officer that                        student demonstrations this year may be worse than those in previous years                        Ghoreishi whose establishment credentials are impeccable sees lack of                        freedom of expression as the most basic student complaint The dilemma in                        Iran in his view is that the situation will gradually worsen unless the                        government relaxes its current strict controls while if it does ease                        restrictions there is risk that the situation will get out of hand such as                        occurred recently in GreeceIn a December 10                            meeting at Killgores home                            Ghoreishi agreed with the students: there is no freedom in this country                            and corruption is everywhere Some people make 50000 a day the Peykan                            automobile people and others dont have enough to eat Yet Killgore reported that when he visited                            Ghoreishi at the heavilyguarded university Ghoreishi claimed that all                            was quiet despite student agitation over cafeteria food Ghoreishis                            tone was indulgent while deprecating the political significance of                            student protest Quite surprisingly in view of statements directly to                            the contrary made six days earlier he said that the student troubles                            this year were less serious than those in past years Killgore concluded that Ghoreishi                            meant his initial remarks and was dissimulating in his office Ibid

dissidence However what is                        happening reminds us that with all of its many successes the Iranian regime                        has continued to fail to win the sympathy of its university studentsIn telegram 5111 from Tehran June 21 1974 the                            Embassy reported the largest student riots in 2 years at Pahlavi                            University in Shiraz ostensibly over grades although they took place                            on the anniversary of large riots in Tehran several years before at                            which some students were killed The Embassy concluded however that                            though Iranian student demonstrators often mask national political                            grievances in local university

I TOLD HIM MY FAVORITE ARTICLE WAS ONE FROM THE MANCHESTER GUARDIAN OF NOV 29 WHICH DESCRIBED HIM AS THE MOST MENACING EASTERN EMISSARY TO ARRIVE IN EUROPE SINCE GENGHIS KHAN. YAMANI WAS ONLY BARELY AMUSED.\n3. I ALSO GAVE A PARTICULARLY GORY ACCOUNT OF THE EFFECT THE OPEC PRICE INCREASES WILL HAVE ON THE ECONOMY OF THE WORLD IN GENERAL AND THE DISASTER THAT IT WILL BRING TO INDIA, PAKISTAN, BRAZIL, DENMARK AND OTHERS, MANY OF WHOM ARE FRIENDLY TO THE ARABS. I DID  THIS WITH SOME IMAGINATION AND WITH CONSIDERABLE EXTRA- POLATION AS I DO NOT YET HAVE MUCH SPECIFIC INFORMATION. ANY DETAILS THE DEPARTMENT OR THE ADDRESSEE POSTS COULD SEND US WOULD BE GREATLY APPRECIATED.\n4. THE UNITED STATES WONT LIKE THE INCREASE ANY MORE THAN ANYONE ELSE, I SAID, BUT AT LEAST IT WILL GIVE STRONG IMPETUS TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF ALTERNATIVE FUELS, (I WILL SEND YAMANI THE COPY OF BILL SIMONS STATEMENTS ON THE SUBJECT WHICH APPEARED IN THIS MORNINGS WIRELESS BULLETIN).\n5. IF THE ARABS LOST FRIENDS BY THEIR BOYCOTT, THE PRICE INCREASE HAS TURNED THEM INTO THE WORLDS PRIMARY OGRE. THEY MAY ENJOY THE TEMPORARY ""FRIENDSHIP"" OF EUROPEAN COUNTRIES AND JAPAN, WON BY RAISING OIL PRODUCTION FOR ALL THE WORLD EXCEPT THE UNITED STATES. BUT THIS FRIENDSHIP WILL PROVE TO BE AN EPHEMERAL THING AND WILL EVAPORATE IN THE HOT SUN OF CONSUMER ATTEMPTS TO GET MONEY TO PAY FOR THEIR OIL IMPORTS.\n6. YAMANI BRISTLED AND ASKED IF I HADNT HEARD WHAT HE HAD TOLD ME THAT MORNING; THAT HE HAD TRIED TO KEEP    SECRET  PRICES LOW; IT WAS THE SHAH WHO HAD INSISTED ON HIGHER PRICES. I TOLD HIM THAT OF COURSE I HAD HEARD AND BELIEVED HIM BUT IN THE EYES OF THE WORLD, LIKE IT OR NOT, OIL EQUALED ARABS. IRANIANS, VENEZUELANS AND ALL OTHER PRODUCING COUNTRIES FIGURED ONLY MARGINALLY INTO THIS EQUATION.\n7. HE THEN PROCEEDED TO GIVE ME A FULL ACCOUNT OF THE OPEC MEETING. HE SAID HE HAD GONE TO TEHRAN WITH IN- STRUCTIONS TO BE MODERATE AND HE WAS. INITIALLY HE PROPOSED RAISING TAXES AND ROYALTIES ON ARABIAN LIGHT CRUDE TO $4.25 FROM THE APPROXIMATE $3.05 AT PRESENT. (N.B.: ARABIAN LIGHT CRUDE IS RELATIVELY LOW SULPHUR,\n8. THE SHAH, VIGOROUSLY SUPPORTED BY KUWAIT, DEMANDED THAT TAXES BE RAISED TO $8.50. QATAR WOULD PROBABL* HAVE GONE ALONG WITH THE MILDER SAUDI POSITION BUT MOST OTHERS SUPPORTED IRAN. ""ABU DHABI,"" YAMANI SAID, ""ALWAYS WANTS MORE MONEY* LIBYA GOES ITS WON WAY AND WILL RAISE PRICES NO MATTER WHAT IS DONE; INDONESIA, AS USUAL, SAID NOTHING AND IS CONTENT TO PICK UP THE ADVANTAGES WON BY OTHERS. NIGERIA AID NOTHING BUT VOTED FOR THE IRANIAN POSITION AND VENEZUELA WAS REPRESENTED BY ITS AMBASSADOR TO IRAN, A NITWIT, WHO SUCCEEDED IN ANTAGONIZING THE SHAH EVEN WHILE FAWNING ON HIM - A RARE TALENT. STRANGELY ENOUGH, IRAQ MIGHT HAVE SUPPORTED ME - NOT BECAUSE THEY DONT WANT MORE MONEY OR BECAUSE THEY HAVE DEVELOPED A LOVE FOR SAUDI ARABIA BUT BECAUSE THEY HATE IRAN MORE.""\n9. YAMANI SAID HE MAINTAINED A FIRM POSITION AGAINST THE HIGHER PRICE UNTIL THE IRANIANS REDUCED THEIR    SECRET  DEMAND TO $7.00, AND AMOUZEGAR RETURNED TO THE MEETING WITH A PERSONAL  MESSAGE FROM THE SHAH. THE SHAH SAID THAT IF YAMANI WERE WORRYING ABOUT THE CONSUMERS HE SHOULD STOP. THE $7.00 TAX WOULD TRANS- LATE INTO A DELIVERED PRICE OF AROUND $8.50/BARREL WHICH WAS THE COST OF ALTERNATIVE ENERGY TO THE U.S. AND EUROPE. THIS NEW TAX HAD BEEN DISCUSSED WITH THE UNITED STATES, GREAT BRITAIN AND OTHER MAJOR CONSUMERS, THE SHAH SAID, AND THEY UNDERSTOOD THE IRANIAN RATIONALE AND APPROVED IT.\n0. I SAID SOMEONE HAD ROCKS IN HIS HEAD. $8.50 MAY BE THE COST OF ALTERNATIVE FUEL AND IT MAY ULTIMATELY SERVE AS THE UPPER RPT UPPER LIMIT ON PETROLEUM PRICES BUT NO ONE COULD POSSIBLY APPROVE SUCH AN INCREASE TODAY. THERE WERE INDEED NUMEROUS STATEMENTS FROM THE UNITED STATES ON WHAT WE COULD DO IN EVENTUALLY DEVELOPING OTHER ENERGY SOURCES BUT IN THE SHORT RUN - I.E. THE NEXT TEN YEARS - WE WILL HAVE DIFFICULTY IN FINDING THE MONEY TO PAY FOR OUR IMPORTED OIL. AND THE ALLEGATION THAT BRITIAN IN ITS PRESENT STATE UNDERSTOOD, MUST LESS APPROVED, SUCH A DRASTIC INCREASE IN OIL PRICES WAS ABSURD; I WOULD HAVE THOUGHT AMOUZEGAR WOULD HAVE MORE SHAME THAN TO MAKE SUCH A STATEMENT. AS FAR AS I COULD TELL THE REACTION OF ALL MAJOR CONSUMERS HAS BEEN ONE OF PURE HORROR, NOT OF CALM ""UNDERSTANDING.""\n1. YAMANI REPLIED THAT AT THAT POINT HE CALLED JIDDA FOR INSTRUCTIONS. HE WAS ONLY ABLE TO REACH PRINCE FAHD, MINISTER OF INTERIOR, WHO TOLD HIM HE SHOULDNT RISK ANTAGONIZING THE SHAH.\n2. ON HIS RETURN TO JIDDA, YAMANI SAID HE WAS GIVEN A ROYAL DRESSING DOWN BY THE KING (WE HAVE THIS FROM OTHER SOURCES), WHO SAID HE WAS WRONG TO TAKE FAHDS ADVICE; HE SHOULD HAVE INSISTED ON TALKING WITH THE KING HIMSELF, AND HE WOULD HAVE ORDERED HIM TO STICK WITH THE LOWER PRICE.  YAMANI COMMENTED TO ME THAT THIS WOULD HAVE BEEN DIFFICULT; IF THE REST OF OPEC    SECRET  HAD RAISED PRICES AND ONLY SAUDI ARABIA HAD HELD THEM LOW, SAUDI OIL WOULD STILL HAVE BEEN SOLD AT THE WORLD PRICE AND THE OIL COMPANIES, RATHER THAN THE SAUDI GOVERNMENT, WOULD HAVE TAKEN THE DIFFERENCE.\n3. I SAID ALL OF THIS MADE ME VERY GLUM. IT WAS CERTAINLY TOO BAD THAT HE DIDNT GET THROUGH TO THE KING (AND THIS WAS YET ANOTHER REASON WHY SAUDI ARABIS SHOULD GET AN AMERICAN TELEPHONE NET- WORK INSTALLED). BUT WHAT DID SAUDI ARABIA INTEND TO DO NOW? WAS IT JUST GOING TO SIT BACK AND WATCH THE WORLDS ECONOMY COLLAPSE? I SAID I DIDNT ENVY HIM HIS RESPONSIBILITY; AND MAYBE THE WORLD WOULD BE  BETTER OFF WITH GUNGHIS KHAN, AFTER ALL.\n4. YAMANI THEN SUGGESTED THAT THE ONLY THING TO DO SEEMED TO BE TO LOWER PRICES. OPEC COULD BE RECONVENED, HE SAID, IT COULD ANNNOUNCE THAT IT HAD MISCALCULATED THE EFFECT THE HIGHER PRICE WOULD HAVE ON THE WORLDS ECONOMY; AND THE PRICES WOULD HENCEFORTH BE LOWERED (HE THOUGHT A REDUCTION IN THE TAX FIGURES BY $1.00-\n1.50; I.E. TO $5.50-$6.00 (""OR MAYBE LOWER"") WOULD BE  ACC PTABLE TO ALL OPEC EXCEPT IRAN. HE ADDED THAT IT*IS ESSENTIAL FIRST TO PERSUADE  HE SHAH TO CHANGE HIS POSITION. IF THE SHAH, ""THE WESTS BEST FRIEND I *THE MID LE EAST,"" MAINTAINS THAT THE HIGHER PRICE IS BOTH FAIR AND ACCEPTABLE TO THE CONSUMERS, THE USG COULDNT EXPECT HIM (YAMANI) TO SWAY ANY OF THE WAVERERS.\n5. YAMANI SAID SAUDI ARABIA WOULD ASK FOR AN EMERGENCY MEETING OF OPEC TO RECONSIDER TAXES AS SOON AS I COULD TELL HIM THE USG OR OTHER CONSUMERS HAD PERSUADED THE SHAH TO BACK DOWN. HE SUGGESTED THAT WE AND THE BRITISH TELL THE IRANIANS THAT WE WERE SHOCKED TO HEAR REPORTS THAT WE HAD ""APPROVED"" THE PRICE INCREASES; THAT THERE MUST HAVE BEEN SOME SERIOUS MISUNDERSTANDING. IN SHORT, HE SAID, ""GIVE THE SHAH THE SAME TREATMENT YOUVE GIVEN ME.""\n6. COMMENT AND SUGGESTED ACTION: IN RECAPITULATING THE EVENINGS CONVERSATION I ASKED YAMANI IF THERE    SECRET  WERENT SOME POSSIBILITY THAT THERE HAD BEEN AN HONEST MISUNDERSTANDING IN TEHRAN ABOUT THE ACCEPTABILITY OF THE PRICE INCREASE TO CONSUMERS. HE RECONSIDERED AND SAID THAT AMOUZEGARS PHRASING MIGHT HAVE CONTAINED SOME DELIBERATE AMBIGUITIES, BUT THE IMPRESSION OF THE CONFERENCE WAS CLEARLY THAT THE U.S., BRITAIN AND OTHERS HAD BEEN CONSULTED BY THE SHAH AND HAD GIVEN THEIR APPROVAL. YAMANI SAID THAT HE WOULD HAVE NO OBJECTION WHATSOEVER IN BEING QUOTED TO THE IRANIANS ON THIS OR ON ANYTHING ELSE HE HAD TOLD ME ABOUT THE OPEC MEETING; AND HE WOULD BE INTERESTED IN LEARNING WHAT THE IRANIANS WOULD TELL OUR AMBASSADOR HE HAD SAID.\n7. WE CANT WASTE MUCH TIME IF WE ARE TO DECIDE TO PUT PRESSURE ON THE SHAH. THE SHOCK IN THE CONSUMER COUNTRIES IS LIKELY TO TURN INTO NUMBED PARALYSIS AT THE SAME TIME THE PRODUCERS ARE FREEZING THEIR CALCULATIONS ON WHAT THEY WILL DO WITH THEIR NEWLY ANTICIPATED WEALTH.\n8. THE LAST MINUTE SERIES OF DEMARCHES THE CONSUMERS MADE TO THE OPEC COUNTRIES MAY HAVE SAVED US FROM THE SHAHS PROPOSED $8.50 TAX ON OIL, BUT $7.00 IS STILL BAD. I WOULD HOPE THAT THE U.S. COULD NOW PUSH STRONGLY FOR JOINT CONSUMER ACTION AND CONSUMER/PRODUCER CONTACTS. THE SECRETARY HAS RAISED THE MATTER ALREADY. EUROPES AND JAPANS REACTION WAS LUKEWARM BUT THEIR INTEREST SHOULD HAVE BEEN HEATED UP CONSIDERABLY BY THE RECENT PRICE INCREASES. WE SHOULD, I BELIEVE, NOW CONSIDER AN OPEC-OECD OR AN OPEC-MAJOR CONSUMER CONFERENCE ON PRICING WHERE WE MIGHT EVEN BE ABLE TO ACCEPT THE  ALTERNATIVE ENERGY COST"" CONCEPT FOR 1980. WE MIGHT ALSO WORK OUT A SCALED INCREASE IN PRICES FOR THE NEXT FEW YEARS UNTIL THAT POINT IS REACHED, BUT THE MOST IMPORTANT CONCERN NOW WOULD BE TO GET OPEC BACKED OFF ITS CURRENT DEMANDS. THE MEETING COULD ALSO SET THE STAGE FOR SUBSEQUENT CONSUMER-PRODUCER COOPERATION ON MONETARY MATTERS, INVESTMENTS AND INDUSTRIALIZATION.\n8. UNLESS EUROPE AND JAPAN ARE SHOWING MUCH MORE RESOLUTION THAN THEY DID WHEN I ATTENDED THE OECD    SECRET  MEETINGS, THE U.S. WILL HAVE TO TAKE THE LEAD IN CALLING FOR AND ORGANIZING SUCH A MEETING OR ANY OTHER CONSUMER ACTION. NO ONE ELSE IS WILLING OR CAPABLE OF LEADERSHIP.  AKINS UNQUOTE  KISSINGER\n",682131

AT AUDIENCE ON AFTERNOON OF DECEMBER 20, THE SHAH INDICATED  THAT HE IS SERIOUSLY CONSIDERING TRYING TO PERSUADE THE OTHER OPEC MEMBERS AT THE MEETING IN TEHRAN ON DECEMBER 22 THAT WHOLLY NEW PRICING ARRANGEMENTS FOR CRUDE OIL SHOULD BE ESTABLISHED.\n2. WHAT THE SHAH APPARENTLY HAS IN MIND SOUNDS COMPLICATED, AND HIS ASSERTION THAT PERHAPS SOME OF THE OPEC MEMBERS WILL NOT EVEN UNDERSTAND IT CAN HARDLY BE FOUND SURPRISING. IN FACT, HE CONCEDED THAT IT MIGHT BE NECESSARY AT THE DECEMBER 22 MEETING TO ESTABLISH TEMPORARILY FOR 90 DAYS OR SO NEW POSTED PRICES UNTIL THE DETAILS INVOLVED IN HIS SCHEME COULD BE WORKED OUT.\n3. AS BEST I COULD UNDERSTAND HIS PRESENTATION, THE SHAH WANTS TO DO AWAY WITH POSTED PRICES AND TO FIX THE PRICE OF CRUDE OIL IN RELATIONSHIP TO THE COST OF OIL PRODUCED FROM SHALE, COAL GASI- FICATION AND LIQUEFICATION, ATOMIC ENERGY USED FOR POWER, ETC. HE CLAIMS THAT THE COST INVOLVED IN THESE ALTERNATE SOURCES OF  ENERGY RANGE BETWEEN 8 AND 14 DOLLARS PER BARREL WHEN ONE USES THE MATHEMATICS TO CONVERT FROM ONE KIND OF ENERGY TO ANOTHER. THE  SHAH FEELS THAT BY FIXING THE PRICE OF CRUDE OIL IN THIS FASHION, IT WILL DO AWAY WITH ""SURPRISES"" FROM PEOPLE LIKE QADHAFI AND ""EVEN MYSELF"", AND WILL PLACE A DISCIPLINE ON THE INDUSTRIAL  NATIONS OF THE WORLD. IT WILL ALSO ESTABLISH A STABLE RATIO AMONG THE VARIOUS FORMS OF ENERGY. INCIDENTALLY, THE SHAH EXPECTS THAT IRAN WILL SOON BE ONE OF THESE INDUSTRIAL NATIONS AND THAT  IN TEN YEARS ""IT WILL BE EQUIVALENT TO BRITAIN OR FRANCE"".\n4. IN COMPUTING THE PRICE OF CRUDE OIL IN RELATION TO THESE OTHER ENERGY SOURCES, THE SHAH BELIEVES THAT CRUDE OIL SHOULD RECEIVE FAVORABLE RECOGNITION BECAUSE IT IS EASIER TO TRANSPORT AND  HANDLE, IT IS CLEANER IN AN ENVIRONMENTAL SENSE, AND IT CAN BE CONVERTED INTO PETRO-CHEMICALS AND OTHER PRODUCTS. IN OTHER WORDS, ONE WOULD WANT TO SUBTRACT FROM THE CRUDE OIL PRICE FOR THE COST OF TRANSPORTATION BUT ADD ON TO IT FOR OILS VALUE IN THE  ENVIRONMENTAL AND CONVERSION SENSE.\n5.

Embassy transmitted a                            warning from Yamani that he had                            little hope of preventing OPEC from                            raising prices dramatically at the OPEC meeting in Tehran December 2223 Ibid Telegram                            9001 from Tehran December 21 summarized a conversation between the                            Shah and Helms in which the Shah                            indicated that he is seriously considering trying to persuade the other                                OPEC members at the meeting in                            Tehran on December 22 that wholly new pricing arrangement for crude oil                            should be established He intended to eliminate the posted price and                            fix the price of crude oil in relation to the cost of other energy                            sources like coal shale and atomic energy Ibid                            P7500332405 Kuwait pass Doha1 Acting Assistant Secretary Davies                        called Iranian Ambassador Zahedi to                        express concern at reports that USG                        receiving about possible inordinate price increases for oil at forthcoming                            OPEC meeting scheduled to begin in Tehran on December                            22In a telephone conversation on June 5                            1975 columnist Jack Anderson asked Kissinger about a Government paper that he had                            describing the Secretarys December 19 meeting with French Foreign                            Minister Jobert The paper                            indicated that Jobert could not                            understand the American Governments attitude toward the Shah of Iran                            It was clear he said that the Shah was going to push for another major                            oil price increase by exploiting the current embargo induce shortage                            and yet the United States acted as if it considered the Shah to be a                            friendly country with the same interest Noting the 2223 per barrel                            auction prices that the American independent oil companies had recently                            paid Jobert had warned the                            Secretary of State that these artificial prices would be used as a                            pretext to justify higher overall OPEC                            prices Department of State Electronic Reading Room Transcripts of

countries sought to take shortterm                        advantage of situation it would create critical problem both for                        industrialized countries and especially developing countries which do not                        have their own sources of energy such as India and Pakistan US believed                        that the Middle East producers such as Iran and Saudi Arabia had longterm                        interest in stability of oil prices but if there were a threefold increase                        in realized prices which we understand some producers were advocating the                        adverse pressures on industrialized economies and on world development                        generally would be tremendous and could generate countermeasures Slowing of                        the developmental process would have implications for stability in                        developing countries which could only adversely affect Free World including                        Iranian and Saudi interests2 Zahedi said that he had already                        sent his personal views to the Shah that the disruption of the oil pricing                        system was unhealthy and that it would be a mistake for OPEC to let oil prices to get too far out of                        hand Zahedi thought however that                        the mistake had originally been made by American companies submitting bids                        for Nigerian oil of 1618 per barrel While he could appreciate that these                        purchases had been due perhaps to force majeure nevertheless they had                        affected world oil prices generally3 Zahedi said he would try to convey                        the Departments concern immediately to the Shah who is about to leave for                        his vacation in Switzerland Zahedi                        himself is leaving for Switzerland tomorrow and he would also be in contact                        with the Shah thereRush,frus1969-76v27d48,"1. SUMMARY: YAMANI UNDERSTANDS EFFECTS RECENT PRICE INCREASES WILL HAVE ON WORLD ECONOMY; SAYS PRICE IN- CREASES WERE FORCED ON OPEC BY THE SHAH; REPORTS KING FAISALS ANGER AT MAGNITUDE OF INCREASE; TELLS AMBASSADOR THAT SAUDI ARABIA WOULD SUPPORT PRICE REDUCTION OF \n1.00-$1.50/BBL. AND SAYS OPEC WOULD FOLLOW SAUDI LEAD PROVIDED SUG (OR OTHERS) CAN CONVINCE SHAH TO GO ALONG. END SUMMARY.\n2. I HAD A SECOND LONG CONVERSATION WITH YAMANI LATE YESTERDAY EVENING (DEC 26) AT HIS REQUEST. I GAVE HIM A LARGE SELECTION OF EUROPEAN AND AMERICAN NEWSPAPER CLIPPINGS ABOUT HIS TRAVELS AND RECENT OPEC ""TRIUMPHS."" I TOLD HIM MY FAVORITE ARTICLE WAS ONE FROM THE MANCHESTER GUARDIAN OF NOV 29 WHICH DESCRIBED HIM AS THE MOST MENACING EASTERN EMISSARY TO ARRIVE IN EUROPE SINCE GENGHIS KHAN. YAMANI WAS ONLY BARELY AMUSED.\n3. I ALSO GAVE A PARTICULARLY GORY ACCOUNT OF THE EFFECT THE OPEC PRICE INCREASES WILL HAVE ON THE ECONOMY OF THE WORLD IN GENERAL AND THE DISASTER THAT IT WILL BRING TO INDIA, PAKISTAN, BRAZIL, DENMARK AND OTHERS, MANY OF WHOM ARE FRIENDLY TO THE ARABS. I DID  THIS WITH SOME IMAGINATION AND WITH CONSIDERABLE EXTRA- POLATION AS I DO NOT YET HAVE MUCH SPECIFIC INFORMATION. ANY DETAILS THE DEPARTMENT OR THE ADDRESSEE POSTS COULD SEND US WOULD BE GREATLY APPRECIATED.\n4. THE UNITED STATES WONT LIKE THE INCREASE ANY MORE THAN ANYONE ELSE, I SAID, BUT AT LEAST IT WILL GIVE STRONG IMPETUS TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF ALTERNATIVE FUELS, (I WILL SEND YAMANI THE COPY OF BILL SIMONS STATEMENTS ON THE SUBJECT WHICH APPEARED IN THIS MORNINGS WIRELESS BULLETIN).\n5. IF THE ARABS LOST FRIENDS BY THEIR BOYCOTT, THE PRICE INCREASE HAS TURNED THEM INTO THE WORLDS PRIMARY OGRE.    SECRET  THEY MAY ENJOY THE TEMPORARY ""FRIENDSHIP"" OF EUROPEAN COUNTRIES AND JAPAN, WON BY RAISING OIL PRODUCTION FOR ALL THE WORLD EXCEPT THE UNITED STATES. BUT THIS FRIENDSHIP WILL PROVE TO BE AN EPHEMERAL THING AND WILL EVAPORATE IN THE HOT SUN OF CONSUMER ATTEMPTS TO GET MONEY TO PAY FOR THEIR OIL IMPORTS.\n6. YAMANI BRISTLED AND ASKED IF I HADNT HEARD WHAT HE HAD TOLD ME THAT MORNING; THAT HE HAD TRIED TO KEEP PRICES LOW; IT WAS THE SHAH WHO HAD INSISTED ON HIGHER PRICES. I TOLD HIM THAT OF COURSE I HAD HEARD AND BELIEVED HIM BUT IN THE EYES OF THE WORLD, LIKE IT OR NOT, OIL EQUALED ARABS. IRANIANS, VENEZUELANS AND ALL OTHER PRODUCING COUNTRIES FIGURED ONLY MARGINALLY INTO THIS EQUATION.\n7. HE THEN PROCEEDED TO GIVE ME A FULL ACCOUNT OF THE OPEC MEETING. HE SAID HE HAD GONE TO TEHRAN WITH IN- STRUCTIONS TO BE MODERATE AND HE WAS. INITIALLY HE PROPOSED RAISING TAXES AND ROYALTIES ON ARABIAN LIGHT CRUDE TO $4.25 FROM THE APPROXIMATE $3.05 AT PRESENT. (N.B.: ARABIAN LIGHT CRUDE IS RELATIVELY LOW SULPHUR,\n8. THE SHAH, VIGOROUSLY SUPPORTED BY KUWAIT, DEMANDED THAT TAXES BE RAISED TO $8.50. QATAR WOULD PROBABLY HAVE GONE ALONG WITH THE MILDER SAUDI POSITION BUT MOST OTHERS SUPPORTED IRAN. ""ABU DHABI,"" YAMANI SAID, ""ALWAYS WANTS MORE MONEY. LIBYA GOES ITS WON WAY AND WILL RAISE PRICES NO MATTER WHAT IS DONE; INDONESIA, AS USUAL, SAID NOTHING AND IS CONTENT TO PICK UP THE ADVANTAGES WON BY OTHERS. NIGERIA AID NOTHING BUT VOTED FOR THE IRANIAN POSITION AND VENEZUELA WAS REPRESENTED BY ITS AMBASSADOR TO IRAN,    SECRET  A NITWIT, WHO SUCCEEDED IN ANTAGONIZING THE SHAH EVEN WHILE FAWNING ON HIM - A RARE TALENT. STRANGELY ENOUGH, IRAQ MIGHT HAVE SUPPORTED ME - NOT BECAUSE THEY DONT WANT MORE MONEY OR BECAUSE THEY HAVE DEVELOPED A LOVE FOR SAUDI ARABIA BUT BECAUSE THEY HATE IRAN MORE.""\n9. YAMANI SAID HE MAINTAINED A FIRM POSITION AGAINST THE HIGHER PRICE UNTIL THE IRANIANS REDUCED THEIR DEMAND TO $7.00, AND AMOUZEGAR RETURNED TO THE MEETING WITH A PERSONAL  MESSAGE FROM THE SHAH. THE SHAH SAID THAT IF YAMANI WERE WORRYING ABOUT THE CONSUMERS HE SHOULD STOP. THE $7.00 TAX WOULD TRANS- LATE INTO A DELIVERED PRICE OF AROUND $8.50/BARREL WHICH WAS THE COST OF ALTERNATIVE ENERGY TO THE U.S. AND EUROPE. THIS NEW TAX HAD BEEN DISCUSSED WITH THE UNITED STATES, GREAT BRITAIN AND OTHER MAJOR CONSUMERS, THE SHAH SAID, AND THEY UNDERSTOOD THE IRANIAN RATIONALE AND APPROVED IT.\n0. I SAID SOMEONE HAD ROCKS IN HIS HEAD. $8.50 MAY BE THE COST OF ALTERNATIVE FUEL AND IT MAY ULTIMATELY SERVE AS THE UPPER RPT UPPER LIMIT ON PETROLEUM PRICES BUT NO ONE COULD POSSIBLY APPROVE SUCH AN INCREASE TODAY. THERE WERE INDEED NUMEROUS STATEMENTS FROM THE UNITED STATES ON WHAT WE COULD DO IN EVENTUALLY DEVELOPING OTHER ENERGY SOURCES BUT IN THE SHORT RUN - I.E. THE NEXT TEN YEARS - WE WILL HAVE DIFFICULTY IN FINDING THE MONEY TO PAY FOR OUR IMPORTED OIL. AND THE ALLEGATION THAT BRITIAN IN ITS PRESENT STATE UNDERSTOOD, MUST LESS APPROVED, SUCH A DRASTIC INCREASE IN OIL PRICES WAS ABSURD; I WOULD HAVE THOUGHT AMOUZEGAR WOULD HAVE MORE SHAME THAN TO MAKE SUCH A STATEMENT. AS FAR AS I COULD TELL THE REACTION OF ALL MAJOR CONSUMERS HAS BEEN ONE OF PURE HORROR, NOT OF CALM ""UNDERSTANDING.""\n1. YAMANI REPLIED THAT AT THAT POINT HE CALLED JIDDA FOR INSTRUCTIONS. HE WAS ONLY ABLE TO REACH PRINCE FAHD, MINISTER OF INTERIOR, WHO TOLD HIM HE SHOULDNT RISK ANTAGONIZING THE SHAH.\n2. ON HIS RETURN TO JIDDA, YAMANI SAID HE WAS GIVEN A ROYAL DRESSING DOWN BY THE KING (WE HAVE THIS FROM OTHER SOURCES), WHO SAID HE WAS WRONG TO TAKE FAHDS ADVICE; HE SHOULD HAVE INSISTED ON TALKING WITH THE KING HIMSELF, AND HE WOULD HAVE ORDERED HIM TO STICK WITH THE LOWER PRICE.\n3. I SAID ALL OF THIS MADE ME VERY GLUM. IT WAS CERTAINLY TOO BAD THAT HE DIDNT GET THROUGH TO THE KING (AND THIS WAS YET ANOTHER REASON WHY    SECRET  SAUDI ARABIS SHOULD GET AN AMERICAN TELEPHONE NET- WORK INSTALLED). BUT WHAT DID SAUDI ARABIA INTEND TO DO NOW? WAS IT JUST GOING TO SIT BACK AND WATCH THE WORLDS ECONOMY COLLAPSE? I SAID I DIDNT ENVY HIM HIS RESPONSIBILITY; AND MAYBE THE WORLD WOULD BE  BETTER OFF WITH GUNGHIS KHAN, AFTER ALL.\n4. YAMANI THEN SUGGESTED THAT THE ONLY THING TO DO SEEMED TO BE TO LOWER PRICES. OPEC COULD BE RECONVENED, HE SAID, IT COULD ANNNOUNCE THAT IT HAD MISCALCULATED THE EFFECT THE HIGHER PRICE WOULD HAVE ON THE WORLDS ECONOMY; AND THE PRICES WOULD HENCEFORTH BE LOWERED (HE THOUGHT A REDUCTION IN THE TAX FIGURES BY $1.00-\n1.50; I.E. TO $5.50-$6.00 (""OR MAYBE LOWER"") WOULD BE  ACCEPTABLE TO ALL OPEC EXCEPT IRAN. HE ADDED THAT IT IS ESSENTIAL FIRST TO PERSUADE THE SHAH TO CHANGE HIS POSITION. IF THE SHAH, ""THE WESTS BEST FRIEND IN THE MIDDLE EAST,"" MAINTAINS THAT THE HIGHER PRICE IS BOTH FAIR AND ACCEPTABLE TO THE CONSUMERS, THE USG COULDNT EXPECT HIM (YAMANI) TO SWAY ANY OF THE WAVERERS.\n5. YAMANI SAID SAUDI ARABIA WOULD ASK FOR AN EMERGENCY MEETING OF OPEC TO RECONSIDER TAXES AS SOON AS I COULD TELL HIM THE USG OR OTHER CONSUMERS HAD PERSUADED THE SHAH TO BACK DOWN. HE SUGGESTED THAT WE AND THE BRITISH TELL THE IRANIANS THAT WE WERE SHOCKED TO HEAR REPORTS THAT WE HAD ""APPROVED"" THE PRICE INCREASES; THAT THERE MUST HAVE BEEN SOME SERIOUS MISUNDERSTANDING. IN SHORT, HE SAID, ""GIVE THE SHAH THE SAME TREATMENT YOUVE GIVEN ME.""\n6. COMMENT AND SUGGESTED ACTION: IN RECAPITULATING THE EVENINGS CONVERSATION I ASKED YAMANI IF THERE WERENT SOME POSSIBILITY THAT THERE HAD BEEN AN HONEST MISUNDERSTANDING IN TEHRAN ABOUT THE ACCEPTABILITY OF THE PRICE INCREASE TO CONSUMERS. HE RECONSIDERED AND SAID THAT AMOUZEGARS PHRASING MIGHT HAVE CONTAINED SOME DELIBERATE AMBIGUITIES, BUT THE IMPRESSION OF THE CONFERENCE WAS CLEARLY THAT THE U.S., BRITAIN AND OTHERS HAD BEEN CONSULTED BY THE SHAH AND HAD GIVEN THEIR APPROVAL. YAMANI SAID THAT HE WOULD HAVE NO OBJECTION    SECRET  WHATSOEVER IN BEING QUOTED TO THE IRANIANS ON THIS OR ON ANYTHING ELSE HE HAD TOLD ME ABOUT THE OPEC MEETING; AND HE WOULD BE INTERESTED IN LEARNING WHAT THE IRANIANS WOULD TELL OUR AMBASSADOR HE HAD SAID.\n7. WE CANT WASTE MUCH TIME IF WE ARE TO DECIDE TO PUT PRESSURE ON THE SHAH. THE SHOCK IN THE CONSUMER COUNTRIES IS LIKELY TO TURN INTO NUMBED PARALYSIS AT THE SAME TIME THE PRODUCERS ARE FREEZING THEIR CALCULATIONS ON WHAT THEY WILL DO WITH THEIR NEWLY ANTICIPATED WEALTH.\n8. THE LAST MINUTE SERIES OF DEMARCHES THE CONSUMERS MADE TO THE OPEC COUNTRIES MAY HAVE SAVED US FROM THE SHAHS PROPOSED $8.50 TAX ON OIL, BUT $7.00 IS STILL BAD. I WOULD HOPE THAT THE U.S. COULD NOW PUSH STRONGLY FOR JOINT CONSUMER ACTION AND CONSUMER/PRODUCER CONTACTS. THE SECRETARY HAS RAISED THE MATTER ALREADY. EUROPES AND JAPANS REACTION WAS LUKEWARM BUT THEIR INTEREST SHOULD HAVE BEEN HEATED UP CONSIDERABLY BY THE RECENT PRICE INCREASES. WE SHOULD, I BELIEVE, NOW CONSIDER AN OPEC-OECD OR AN OPEC-MAJOR CONSUMER CONFERENCE ON PRICING WHERE WE MIGHT EVEN BE ABLE TO ACCEPT THE  ALTERNATIVE ENERGY COST"" CONCEPT FOR 1980. WE MIGHT ALSO WORK OUT A SCALED INCREASE IN PRICES FOR THE NEXT FEW YEARS UNTIL THAT POINT IS REACHED, BUT THE MOST IMPORTANT CONCERN NOW WOULD BE TO GET OPEC BACKED OFF ITS CURRENT DEMANDS. THE MEETING COULD ALSO SET THE STAGE FOR SUBSEQUENT CONSUMER-PRODUCER COOPERATION ON MONETARY MATTERS, INVESTMENTS AND INDUSTRIALIZATION.\n8. UNLESS EUROPE AND JAPAN ARE SHOWING MUCH MORE RESOLUTION THAN THEY DID WHEN I ATTENDED THE OECD MEETINGS, THE U.S. WILL HAVE TO TAKE THE LEAD IN CALLING FOR AND ORGANIZING SUCH A MEETING OR ANY OTHER CONSUMER ACTION. NO ONE ELSE IS WILLING OR CAPABLE OF LEADERSHIP. AKINS\n",682322

deep                        concern over the decisions reached in Tehran on December 23 for drastic                        increase in oil prices The Shah should also be informed that the President                        has communicated to King Faisal and                        President Sadat our dismay at December 25 OAPEC decision in Kuwait to continue the discriminatory oil

December 28 with Schlesinger Colby Moorer and Scowcroft Kissinger announced: We sent a scorching letter to                            Faisal and Sadat and will send one to the Shah We have said our ability                            to proceed in the peace talks depends on an end to the embargo                                Moorer observed: Two can                            play this Maybe we should raise the price of our stuff to the Shah to                            which Schlesinger replied: We                            are I am thinking of charging him 19 million dollars for the F15

Energy Crisis 19691974 Document 274                        Following are the points you should make orally:A The President is greatly concerned over the destabilizing impact that the                        price increases agreed to at Tehran for Persian Gulf crudes will have on the                        worlds economy and the catastrophic problems it could pose for the                        international monetary system Not only will it result in raising the prices                        of manufactured products but it will have severe repressive effect on the                        economies of oil consumers which could cause a worldwide recession and which                        eventually would benefit no one including oil exportersB We believe this drastic price increase is particularly unreasonable coming                        as it does when oil supplies are being artificially restrained If this                        decision is implemented it is our preliminary assessment that the worlds                        oil bill in 1974 will more than double to about 100 billion and would be                        equal to onefifth of the value of the Free Worlds imports For the US                        alone it will add at least 10 billion to our oil import bill The                        additional import costs will be at least 23 billion for Western Europe and                        8 billion for Japan For the developing countries it will be at least 9                        billion additional This mammoth rise in costs will place an intolerable                        burden on the economies of many major oil consumers and will prove even more                        harmful for those developing countries that do not have adequate energy                        resourcesC The US endorses the idea of greater consultation and mutual                        understanding between oil producers and consumers which was most recently                        reaffirmed in Secretary Kissingers                        initiative to establish an Energy Action GroupKissinger made this                            proposal on December 12 in London in a speech to the Pilgrim Society in                            what became known as the Pilgrims Speech See ibid Document 264 We strongly                        urge that 1 the recent decisions made in Tehran be reconsidered 2 steps                        be initiated to hold the kind of consultations that we believe most consumer                        and producer countries endorse and 3 the oil producer countries seriously                        examine the deleterious effect of these increases on the balance of payments                        positions of practically all nations in the Free World and the effect this                        will have on world trade in general and on the international monetary system                        in particularD We are making these views known also to Arab oil producers At the same                        time the President is equally dismayed over the December 25 decision by the                        Arab oil producers in Kuwait This decision singles out the US for a                        continuing oil embargo when the US is the only country that is seriously                        trying to bring about the just settlement desired by the Arab world while                        at the same time it allows oil production to increase for other countries                        which are unable to make any significant contribution to a peace effort The                        President views this as undisguised discrimination against the US and we                        are also conveying this point strongly to major Arab leaders We are                        underscoring our views to our principal Arab contacts that it is absolutely essential that the oil                        embargo directed against the US be ended

response that Iran would consider reducing its crude oil                            price only if Venezuela Nigeria Indonesia Libya and Algeria which                            kept raising their

SUMMARY. SECGEN CALLED HIGH-LEVEL OIL GROUP HEADS OF DELEGATION TOGETHER ON DECEMBER 28 PRIMARILY TO PRESENT SECRETARIATS PRELIMINARY ANALYSIS OF THE ECONOMIC IMPACT OF RECENT DECISIONS BY OIL PRODUCERS TO AMELIORATE SUPPLY SITUATION WHILE DOUBLING PRICE. AMONG MOST URGENT ISSUES IDENTIFIED FOR OECD GOVERNMENTS WERE (A) HOW TO REACT TO THE DRASTIC DETERIORATION IN THEIR TRADE BALANCES THAT WILL APPEAR IN THE NEXT FEW MONTHS, AND (B) HOW TO DEAL WITH THE DEFLATIONARY IMPACT OF PROSPECTIVE MASSIVE OUTFLOWS ON CURRENT ACCOUNT AT A GENERALLY UNEASY POINT OF ""CONJUNCTURE"" IN THE INTERNA- TIONAL ECONOMY. END SUMMARY.\n2. SUPPLY SITUATION. LAADING OF SECRETARIAT LED OFF WITH BRIEF ANALYSIS OF OIL SUPPLY SITUATION. APPARENTLY CALCULATING LARGELY ON BASIS OF FIGURES PRESENTED TO DECEMBER 19 OIL COMMITTEE MEETING, HE LIMITED OFFICIAL USE   LIMITED OFFICIAL USE  ESTIMATED THAT ARAB OIL PRODUCERS DECISION TO INCREASE PRODUCTION TO 85 PERCENT OF SEPTEMBER 1973 LEVELS IMPLIES REDUCTION IN FREE WORLD SHORTFALL FOR FIRST QUARTER 1974 TO 6 PERCENT OF PROJECTED DEMAND FOR OIL. HE RECALLED ROUGH OECD ESTIMATE THAT UP TO 10 PERCENT SHORTFALL LIKELY TO BE MANAGEABLE WITHOUT DRACONIAN MEASURES HAVING SEVERE ECONOMIC CONSEQUENCES. UK DEL SUGGESTED THAT DELAYS IN DELIVERIES OWING TO TIME REQUIRED FOR SHIPMENT LIKELY TO PREVENT IMMEDIATE IMPROVE- MENT. UK ESTIMATES IT WILL HAVE 18 PERCENT SHORTFALL IN JANUARY, THOUGH MARKED IMPROVEMENT EXPECTED IN FOLLOWING MONTHS. SECRETARIAT NOTED THAT WHERE TRANSPORT DELAYS SIGNIFICANT, GOVERNMENTS MIGHT BE MORE WILLING TO DRAW DOWN STOCKS IN ANTICIPATION INCREASED DELIVERIES.\n3. PRICES. STRESSING PRELIMINARY NATURE OF HIS REPORT, BASED ON FAIRLY ROUGH CALCULATIONS MADE WITHOUT BENEFIT OF INTENSIVE STAFF WORK WHICH NOW WILL BE BROUGHT TO BEAR ON NEW SITUATION, MARRIS OF SECRETARIAT GAVE CLEAR, WIDE- RANGING ANALYSIS OF SOME OF THE MAJOR ECONOMIC CONSEQUENCES LIKELY TO FLOW FROM THE APPARENT DOUBLING OF OIL PRICES ANNOUNCED AT TEHRAN, AND OF THE POLICY ISSUES THEY POSE. HE SAID THAT BEFORE TEHRAN ANNOUNCEMENT, SECRETARIAT HAD BEEN ENGAGED IN DIFFICULT ANALYSIS OF HIGHLY COMPLICATED SHORT-RUN SITUATION. IT HAD BEEN ATTEMPTING TO CALCULATE THE CONSEQUENCES FOR THE ECONOMIC OUTLOOK OF COMBINATION OF RISING OIL PRICES, SUPPLY SHORTFALL, ANTICIPATORY DECREASES IN DEMAND, AND PROSPECTIVE CUTS IN INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTION LEADING TO INFLATIONARY GAP. WITH NEW SUPPLY SITUATION THERE IS NOW NO REASON TO SUPPOSE THAT SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTION WILL BE NECESSARY. INCREASE OF 3-4 PERCENT IN GNP AND EMPLOYMENT CITED IN LATEST ECONOMIC OUTLOOK IS THEREFORE POSSIBLE TO ACHIEVE -- BUT NOT WITHOUT APPROPRIATE NEW ECONOMIC POLICY DECISIONS. THE LATEST INCREASE IN OIL PRICES IS SO LARGE THAT IT MUST BE REGARDED AS A QUALITATIVE AS WELL AS QUANTITATIVE CHANGE.\n4. ECONOMIC PRICE OF OIL. MARRIS NOTED THAT TEHRAN ANNOUNCE- MENT IMPLIES C.I.F. OIL PRICE OF ABOUT $8.50-9.00 PER BARREL WHICH, HESAID, THAT OPTIMUM PRICE FOR DEPLETABLE RESOURCE IS LONG- RANGE SUBSTITUTION PRICE OF ALTERNATIVE RESOURCES, BUT LIMITED OFFICIAL USE   LIMITED OFFICIAL USE  PRELIMINARY RESULTS FROM OECDS LONG-TERM ENERGY ASSESSMENT SUGGEST $6-8 IS LONG-RANGE SUBSTITUTION PRICE FOR CONVENTIONAL OIL. HIGHER PRICE MAY SPEED DEVELOPMENT OF SUBSTITUTES, ALTER PATTERNS OF DEMAND, ETC. WITH THE EFFECT OF REDUCING LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN TO OIL PRODUCERS. MARRIS POINTED OUT THAT INTERESTS OF OIL PRODUCERS MAY DIFFER. IRAN, WITH LARGE POPULATION AND RELATIVELY GOOD BASE FOR INDUSTRIALIZA- TION, IS LIKELY TO BE MORE INTERESTED IN MAXIMIZING REVENUES IN SHORT TERM. SAUDIA ARABIA IS LIKELY TO BE MORE CONCERNED WITH MAXIMIZING LONG-TERM RATES OF RETURN. IT IS AT LEAST POSSIBLE IN MARRIS VIEW THAT IN LIGHT OF ABOVE CONSIDERA- TIONS NEW PRICE INCREASES MIGHT NOT STICK, THOUGH MUCH WOULD DEPEND ON OECD COUNTRIES REACTIONS.\n5. INFLATIONARY IMPACT. MARIS ESTIMATED THAT DIRECT  IMPACT ON GENERAL PRICE LEVELS OF OECD COUNTRIES OF COMBINED OCTOBER AND DECEMBER OIL PRICE INCREASES WOULD BE OF ORDER OF 1.5 TO 2 PERCENT. (FIGURE WOULD BE LESS IN COUNTRIES WITH SUBSTANTIAL INDIGENOUS SUPPLIES, SUCH AS THE U.S., THOUGH DIFFERENCE MIGHT BE REDUCED BY INCREASE IN PRICE OF DOMESTIC SUPPLIES TO CLOSE GAP BETWEEN DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL MARKETS.) WHEN COMBINED INCREASES WORKED THROUGH ECONOMY, TOTAL EFFECT COULD BE 2-3 PERCENT IN ORDINARY CONDITIONS -- BUT THESE ARE NOT ORDINARY CONDITIONS. OECD OUTLOOK FOR\n6. BALANCE OF PAYMENTS EFFECTS. SECRETARIAT HAD ALREADY ESTIMATED THAT OCTOBER OIL PRICE RISE EQUIVALENT TO\n4. WHEN THIS FIGURE REDUCED BY ALLOWANCE FOR INCREASED OECD EXPORTS TO OIL PRODUCERS AND REDUCTION IN DEMAND, NET NEGATIVE EFFECT ON OECD-WIDE BALANCE OF PAYMENTS ON CURRENT ACCOUNT WAS ESTIMATED AT $9 LIMITED OFFICIAL USE   LIMITED OFFICIAL USE  BILLION, REDUCING SURPLUS THAT HAD BEEN PROJECTED FROM\n0.5      MINUS 5 FRANCE       MINUS 0.8      MINUS 3 TO MINUS 3.5 GERMANY       PLUS 1        MINUS 2 ITALY        MINUS 1.25     MINUS 3 TO MINUS 3.5 UK           MINUS 3        MINUS 5 ALL OTHER OECD PLUS 0.5     MINUS 7 TO MINUS 8 OF BENELUX    PLUS 1.25     MINUS 0.5\n7. DEFLATIONARY POTENTIAL. THE ADDITIONAL $30-35 BILLION SPENT ON OIL, MARRIS CONTINUED, EVENTUALLY WILL FLOW BACK TO THE OECD COUNTRIES, WHO HAVE THE ONLY DEVELOPED MONEY AND FINANCIAL MARKETS. NEVERTHELESS, SITUATION INVOLVES SHARP SHIFT IN INTERNATIONAL DISTRIBUTION OF INCOME TO OIL PRODUCERS WHO HAVE ON AVERAGE HIGH PROPENSITY TO SAVE. UNLESS THESE SAVINGS ARE MATCHED BY AN INCREASE IN INVESTMENT IN THE OECD AREA, THERE WILL BE A SHARP DEFLATIONARY IMPACT. (IMPACT WOULD BE RELATIVELY SMALL IN U.S. BUT MUCH MORE SIGNIFICANT IN OTHER MEMBER STATES WITH SMALLER GNPS.) ONE WAY OF RESTORING BALANCE WOULD BE FOR OECD GOVERNMENTS TO ADOPT POLICIES TO STIMULATE PROVATE INVEST- LIMITED OFFICIAL USE   LIMITED OFFICIAL USE  LIMITED OFFICIAL USE  \n8. POLICY PITFALLS.NEITHER WAY OF DEALING WITH DEFLATIONARY POTENTIAL WOULD HELP B/P CURRENT ACCOUNTS. DEBT TO OIL PRODUCERS WOULD CONTINUE TO BUILD UP, TO HUGE AMOUNTS OVER TIME, WHICH MANY OECD COUNTRIES MAY FIND UNACCEPTABLE. DANGER ISTHAT THEY MAY REACT TO CURRENT ACCOUNT DEFICITS, THAT WILL BE MANIFEST IN SHOCKING FASHION IN TRADE FIGURES FOR AS SOON AS SPRING 1974 IN UNCOORDINATED WAYS THAT COULD LEAD TO WORLD-WIDE RECESSION. MARRIS POINTED OUT THAT PROBLEM PARTLY ONE OF TIING. THERE HAVE BEEN ADJUSTMENTS TO SWINGS IN TERMS OF TRADE OF COMPARABLE MAGNITUDE, BUT THESE ARE EASIER OVER TIME, I.E. WHEN PAYMENTS CAN BE MADE OVER SEVERAL YEARS BY KEEPING GROWTH IN CONSUMPTION SLIGHTLY LOWER THAN GROWTH IN GNP.\n9. IMPCT ON LDCS. MARRIS ESTIMATED THAT 1974 BILL FOR OIL IMPORTING LDCS FROM OCTOBER AND DECEMBER PRICE INCREASES WOULD BE ABOUT $8.5 BILLION. OIL CONSUMPTION IS INCREASING RAPIDLY IN THESE COUNTRIES. AT SAME TIME, THERE APPEARS TO BE TENDENCY FOR EVELOPED COUNTRIES TO REDUCE AID OWING TO THEIR THREATENED B/P DEFICITS. THESE EFFECTS ARE UNFORTUNATE FROM ECONOMIC POINT OF VIEW; THEY MEAN MONEY BEING SHIFTED AWAY FROM COUNTRIES WITH HIGH PROPENSITY TO SPEND, WITH CONSEQUENT NEGATIVE EFFECTS TO BE EXPECTED ON OECD EXPORTS. BOTH MARRIS AND DAC CHAIRMAN (AMB. MARTIN) AGREED THAT ANY SHIFT POSSIBLE OF PURCHASING POWER FROM OIL PRODUCERS TO OTHER LDCS WOULD BE EXONOMICALLY DESIRABLE AND IN OECDS OWN INTEREST. PARIN URGED SHIFT OF DAC COUNTRY AID FROM OIL PRODUCERS SUCH AS INDONESIA TO NON-OIL-PRODUCING LDCS. WHILE MARRIS REMARKED THAT THE OIL PRODUCERS, WHOSE 1974 REVENUES APPARENTLY WILL REACH $70 BILLION, MIGHT HELP NON-OIL-PRODUING LDCS TO MEET INCREASED OIL COSTS, AMB. MARTIN NOTED THAT THE OIL PRODUCERS AID MEASURES HAVE BEEN VERY MODEST SO FAR. DUAL PRICE SYSTEM FOR OIL HAS BEEN DISCUSSED, AMB. MARTIN SAID, BUT WOUL PROBABLY BE DIFFICULT TO MAINTAIN. HE NOTED LDC BORROWING FROM EUROCURRENCY MARKET LIKELY TO BE LIMITED IN AMOUNT BECAUSE OF INABILITY TO AFFORD INTEREST RATES. SUBSIDIZATION OF INTEREST RATES HS BEEN PROPOSED, BUT NEEDS FURTHER ANALYSIS BEFORE CONVINCING CASE CAN BE MADE THAT THIS REPRESENTS BEST USE OF LIMITED AMOUNT OF GRANT AID. IN RESPONSE TO EXPRESSION OF NETHERLANDS CONCERN THAT COUNTRIS MAY SLASH AID TO LDCS IN PANICKY REACTION TO LOOMING B/P DIFFICULTIES, AMB. MARTIN SAID HE PLANS TO CONVENE DAC HEADS OF DELEGATION MEETING WEEK OF JANUARY 1 TO DISCUSS THIS PROBLEM.\n0. OPECCONSUMER COUNTRY DIALOGUE. SECGEN NOTED THAT  IN TEHRAN PRESS CONFERENCE SHAH HAD RAISED AGAIN THE POSSIBILITY OF A DIALOGUE BETWEEN OPEC AND THE OECD COUNTRIES. SECGEN SAID THAT IN HIS VIEW VERY BROAD RAGE OF ISSUES GOING WELL BEYOND THE PROBLEM OF ENERGY NARROWLY DEFINED WOULD HAVE TO ENTER INTO SUCH A DIALOGUE. THE OECD AS AN ORGANIZATION COULD BE, BUT NEED NOT NECESSARILY BE, THE FORUM FOR SUCH A DALOGUE. IT MIGHT ALSO PROVE LIMITED OFFICIAL USE   LIMITED OFFICIAL USE  TO BE DESIRABLE IN VIEW OF THE COMPLEXITY AND VARIETY OF MATTERS TO BE DISCUSSED TO CONFIDE DIFFERENT ISSUES TO DIFFERENT GROUPS IN VARIOUS FRAMEWORKS. SECGEN HOPED OECD MEMBERS WULD REFLECT ON THIS MATTER AND WOULD BE PREPARED TO PROVIDE FURTHER GUIDANCE AT THE NEXT HLG HEADS OF DELEGATION MEETING, TENTATIVELY SCHEDULED FOR JANUARY 14. IN MEANTIME, IMMEDIATE TASK OF OECD IS TO SPED UP ECONOMIC ANALYSIS OF ENERGY SITUATION, HE SAID, INCLUDING ITS WORLD-WIDE IMPLICATIONS. LONG-TERM ENERGY ASSESSMENT WOULD BE GEARED TO ASSISTING THE PROPER APPRECIATION OF THE KEY ISSUES. THERE IS ALSO A NEE TO DETERMINE WHAT COMMON GROUND THERE IS AMONG OECD MEMBERS, HE SAID, TO FACILITATE ANY COMMON APPROACH TO OIL PRODUCERS.\n1. OBJECTIVE ECONOMIC ISSUES. AT INVITATION OF SECGEN, MARRIS DESCRBED SEVERAL ISSUES THAT WOULD BE SUITABLE FOR OBJECTIVE ECONOMIC DISCUSSION WITH OPEC. THESE INCLUDED (A) WHAT IS LONG-RUN SUBSTITUTION PRICE FOR CONVENTIONAL OIL (AND APPROPRIATE TIME FRAME FOR REACHING IT)? (B) HOW SHOULD THE ""TAX"" BETWEEN COST OF PRODUCTION OF OIL AND COST OF ALTERNATIVE SOURCES BE DIVIDED BETWEEN PRODUCERS AND CONSUMERS? (C) WHAT IS A FAIR BARGAIN IN THE EXCHANGE OF IL FOR LONG-TERM ASSETS; (D) HOW CAN POLICIES BE COORDINATED SO THAT MOST PRODUCTIVE USE CAN BE MADE OF PRODUCERS SAVINGS FOR THEIR OWN BENEFIT, AS WELL AS THAT OF OECD COUNTRIES AND OF NON-IL-PRODUCING LDCS?\n2. COUNTRY REACTIONS. ONLY SUBSTANTIVE REACTIONS ON OPEC-OECD COUNTRY DIALOGUE CAME FROM ITALIAN AND FRENCH DELS. ITALIAN DEL REPEATED POSITION HE HAD TAKEN AT ARLIER MEETING IN FAVOR OF GIVING URGENT CONSIDERATION TO OPENING LINKS BETWEEN OPEC AND OECD. HE NOTED THIS WOULD NOT PREVENT BILATERAL COOPERATION WITH OIL PRODUCERS OR COOPERATION IN OTHER INTENATIONAL FRAMEWORKS. HE STATED THAT HIS GOVERNMENT WAS STUDYING THE PROPOSAL FOR AN ENERGY ACTION GROUP WITH DEEP INTEREST. FRENCH DEL STRESSED NEED TO AVOID MOVING TOO RAPIDLY IN ESTABLISING OPEC-OECD CONTRACTS. IT WOULD BE VERY COMPLEX TO DETERMINE CONTENT AND NATURE OF SUCH CONTACTS, HE SAID. FOR EXAMPLE, THERE ARE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE U.S,, WHICH IS AIMING LIMITED OFFICIAL USE   LIMITED OFFICIAL USE  FOR SEL-SUFFICIENCY, AND EUROPE, WHICH WILL DEPEND ON OIL IMPORTS FOR A LONG TIME TO COME.\n3. COMMENT: THOUGH SECRETARIAT PERFORMANCE WAS FORMIDABLE ON SUCH SHORT NOTICE, EVEN FOR A FIRST APROXIMATION, IT WAS PERHAPS NOT SURPRISING. WITH EMPHASIS SHIFTING FROM SUPPLY OF OIL TO PRICE AND ITS ECONOMIC CONSEQUENCES, SECRETARIAT STANDING ON ITS STRONGEST GROUND, ASSISTED BY ELL-ORGANIZED TASK FORCE IN ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS DEPARTMENT AS WELL AS CENTRAL UNIT FOR LONG- TERM ENERGY ASSESSMENT. SECRETARIATS FIRST ASSESSMENT WILL BE TESTED AND AMPLIFIED IN NEX FEW WEEKS FOR CONSIDERATION BY WP-3 AT ITS JANUARY 16 ROME MEETING, BY EPC AND WP-3 MEETINGS IN FEBRUARY AND BY NEXT MEETING OF OIL COMMITTEES HIGH-LEVEL GROUP. THOUGH THE DISCUSSION AT TH HLG HEADS OF DELEGATION MEETING FOCUSSED ON THE ECONOMICS OF THE OIL SITUATION, BOTH THE SECRETARIAT AND SEVERAL DELEGATES EXPLICITLY INDICATED THEIR AWARENESS THAT THE SUPPLY SITUATION IS IN THE IRST INSTANCE A FUNCTION OF THE POLITICAL SITUATION IN THE MIDDLE EAST AND CANNOT BE CONSIDERED STABLE OR NECESSARILY SUBJECT TO CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT.

                    has communicated to King Faisal and                        President Sadat our dismay at December 25 OAPEC decision in Kuwait to continue the discriminatory oil                        embargo while easing production restrictions for other consuming                            countriesIn telegram 4464 from Kuwait                            December 26 the Embassy reported that the OAPEC Oil Ministers meeting in Kuwait pledged to increase                            oil production to 15 percent below the September level up from                            Octobers 25 percent

December 28 with Schlesinger Colby Moorer and Scowcroft Kissinger announced: We sent a scorching letter to                            Faisal and Sadat and will send one to the Shah We have said our ability                            to proceed in the peace talks depends on an end to the embargo                                Moorer observed: Two can                            play this Maybe we should raise the price of our stuff to the Shah to                            which Schlesinger replied: We                            are I am thinking of charging him 19 million dollars for the F15

Energy Crisis 19691974 Document 274                        Following are the points you should make orally:A The President is greatly concerned over the destabilizing impact that the                        price increases agreed to at Tehran for Persian Gulf crudes will have on the                        worlds economy and the catastrophic problems it could pose for the                        international monetary system Not only will it result in raising the prices                        of manufactured products but it will have severe repressive effect on the                        economies of oil consumers which could cause a worldwide recession and which                        eventually would benefit no one including oil exportersB We believe this drastic price increase is particularly unreasonable coming                        as it does when oil supplies are being artificially restrained If this                        decision is implemented it is our preliminary assessment that the worlds                        oil bill in 1974 will more than double to about 100 billion and would be                        equal to onefifth of the value of the Free Worlds imports For the US                        alone it will add at least 10 billion to our oil import bill The                        additional import costs will be at least 23 billion for Western Europe and                        8 billion for Japan For the developing countries it will be at least 9                        billion additional This mammoth rise in costs will place an intolerable                        burden on the economies of many major oil consumers and will prove even more                        harmful for those developing countries that do not have adequate energy                        resourcesC The US endorses the idea of greater consultation and mutual                        understanding between oil producers and consumers which was most recently                        reaffirmed in Secretary Kissingers                        initiative to establish an Energy Action GroupKissinger made this                            proposal on December 12 in London in a speech to the Pilgrim Society in                            what became known as the Pilgrims Speech See ibid Document 264 We strongly                        urge that 1 the recent decisions made in Tehran be reconsidered 2 steps                        be initiated to hold the kind of consultations that we believe most consumer                        and producer countries endorse and 3 the oil producer countries seriously                        examine the deleterious effect of these increases on the balance of payments                        positions of practically all nations in the Free World and the effect this                        will have on world trade in general and on the international monetary system                        in particularD We are making these views known also to Arab oil producers At the same                        time the President is equally dismayed over the December 25 decision by the                        Arab oil producers in Kuwait This decision singles out the US for a                        continuing oil embargo when the US is the only country that is seriously                        trying to bring about the just settlement desired by the Arab world while                        at the same time it allows oil production to increase for other countries                        which are unable to make any significant contribution to a peace effort The                        President views this as undisguised discrimination against the US and we                        are also conveying this point strongly to major Arab leaders We are                        underscoring our views to our principal Arab contacts that it is absolutely essential that the oil                        embargo directed against the US be ended

IN PRESS CONFERENCE VIENNA DEC. 28 BEFORE HANDFUL OF SELECT AUSTRIAN JOURNALISTS AND RADIO/TV REPS, SHAH OF IRAN ENERGETICAL- LY DEFENDED MOST RECENT ROUND OF OIL PRICE INCREASES AND STRESSED THAT CRUDE OIL PRICES WOULD RISE CONSIDERABLY IN FUTURE.  AT SAME TIME HE DECRIED USE OF OIL AS POLITICAL WEAPON.\n2.  SHAH EXPLAINED THAT IT IS ONLY EQUITABLE AND JUST THAT OIL PRODUCING COUNTRIES ARE NOW TRYING TO BRING PRICE OF OIL INTO LINE WITH THAT OF INDUSTRIAL GOODS, STATING THAT INDUSTRIAL COUN- TRIES WERE LONG ABLE TO BUY OIL AT RIDICULOUSLY LOW PRICES WHILE GETTING VERY HIGH PRICES FOR THEIR INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTS.  IN SUP- PORT OF HIS LINE OF ARGUMENTATION SHAH, ACCORDING TO ""DIE PRESSE"", ""LET BITTEREST WORDS FALL OUT ABOUT EXPLOITATION AND COLONIAL POLITICS,"" OBSERVING THAT PRICES OF PETROCHEMICAL PRODUCTS HAD INCREASED 3000 PERCENT SINCE 1947.\n3.  SHAH STATED OIL PRICE INCREASES SHOULD ACCOMPLISH TWO GOALS: (1)  ESTABLISH PROPER RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN CRUDE OIL PRICES AND PRICES OF INDUSTRIAL GOODS IRAN HAS TO IMPORT, AND (2)  SHOW WORLD THAT OIL IS MUCH TOO PRECIOUS A RAW MATERIAL TO BE USED FOR UNCLASSIFIED HEATING AND MOTOR FUEL.  HE SAID OIL SHOULD BE USED FOR PETRO- CHEMICAL INDUSTRY ALONE, WHICH, IF DONE, WOULD EXTEND LIFE OF WORLDS OIL RESERVES FROM THIRTY TO THREE HUNDRED YEARS.\n4.  AS WAY OUT OF CURRENT OIL PRICE CRUNCH, SHAH SUGGESTED TALKS WITH OECD RE TWO POSSIBILITIES (1)  BOTH OIL AND INDUSTRIAL GOODS TO BE SOLD AT RELATED FIX PRICES OR (2)  INCREASES IN OIL PRICES TO BE TIED TO INCREASES IN INDUSTRIAL GOODS VIA INFLATION FACTOR.\n5.  SHAH DISCUSSED AT SOME LENGTH IRANS ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL DE- VELOPMENT AND SAID THAT FIVE-YEAR PLAN, WHICH HAD BEEN COMPLETED NINE MONTHS AGO AND WHICH PROJECTED A MINIMUM ANNUAL PER CAPITA INCOME OF $904 FOR 1978, HAD BEEN LATER REVISED TO PROJECT MINI- MUM PER CAPITA INCOME OF $1500.\n6.  SHAH EXPRESSED HOPE FOR EARLY SETTLEMENT OF NEAR EAST CRISIS AND TERMED OPENING OF GENEVA TALKS ENCOURAGING.  HE SAID HE WAS GLAD ARAB STATES HAVE AGAIN RAISED THEIR OIL PRODUCTION AND RE- MARKED THAT, ACCORDING TO HIS INFORMATION, US HAS BEEN SCARCELY HIT BY OIL BOYCOTT SINCE AMERICAN IMPORTS HAVE INCREASED RATHER THAN DECREASED.\n7.

December 28 with Schlesinger Colby Moorer and Scowcroft Kissinger announced: We sent a scorching letter to                            Faisal and Sadat and will send one to the Shah We have said our ability                            to proceed in the peace talks depends on an end to the embargo                                Moorer observed: Two can                            play this Maybe we should raise the price of our stuff to the Shah to                            which Schlesinger replied: We                            are I am thinking of charging him 19 million dollars for the F15

Energy Crisis 19691974 Document 274                        Following are the points you should make orally:A The President is greatly concerned over the destabilizing impact that the                        price increases agreed to at Tehran for Persian Gulf crudes will have on the                        worlds economy and the catastrophic problems it could pose for the                        international monetary system Not only will it result in raising the prices                        of manufactured products but it will have severe repressive effect on the                        economies of oil consumers which could cause a worldwide recession and which                        eventually would benefit no one including oil exportersB We believe this drastic price increase is particularly unreasonable coming                        as it does when oil supplies are being artificially restrained If this                        decision is implemented it is our preliminary assessment that the worlds                        oil bill in 1974 will more than double to about 100 billion and would be                        equal to onefifth of the value of the Free Worlds imports For the US                        alone it will add at least 10 billion to our oil import bill The                        additional import costs will be at least 23 billion for Western Europe and                        8 billion for Japan For the developing countries it will be at least 9                        billion additional This mammoth rise in costs will place an intolerable                        burden on the economies of many major oil consumers and will prove even more                        harmful for those developing countries that do not have adequate energy                        resourcesC The US endorses the idea of greater consultation and mutual                        understanding between oil producers and consumers which was most recently                        reaffirmed in Secretary Kissingers                        initiative to establish an Energy Action GroupKissinger made this                            proposal on December 12 in London in a speech to the Pilgrim Society in                            what became known as the Pilgrims Speech See ibid Document 264 We strongly                        urge that 1 the recent decisions made in Tehran be reconsidered 2 steps                        be initiated to hold the kind of consultations that we believe most consumer                        and producer countries endorse and 3 the oil producer countries seriously                        examine the deleterious effect of these increases on the balance of payments                        positions of practically all nations in the Free World and the effect this                        will have on world trade in general and on the international monetary system                        in particularD We are making these views known also to Arab oil producers At the same                        time the President is equally dismayed over the December 25 decision by the                        Arab oil producers in Kuwait This decision singles out the US for a                        continuing oil embargo when the US is the only country that is seriously                        trying to bring about the just settlement desired by the Arab world while                        at the same time it allows oil production to increase for other countries                        which are unable to make any significant contribution to a peace effort The                        President views this as undisguised discrimination against the US and we                        are also conveying this point strongly to major Arab leaders We are                        underscoring our views to our principal Arab contacts that it is absolutely essential that the oil                        embargo directed against the US be ended immediately and not await the                        outcome of the current disengagement negotiations in GenevaTelegram 37 from Tehran January 2 1974 transmitted                            the Shahs response that Iran would consider reducing its crude oil                            price only if Venezuela Nigeria Indonesia Libya and Algeria which                            kept raising their prices did the same The Embassy commented: You                            should not in our opinion read any significant degree of hope that Shah                            will reduce prices in the near term However door is still open to                            dialogue on fixing future prices provided consumers and producers can                            get together very soon Ford Library

FOLLOWING ARE SUMMARIES OF NUMEROUS EDITORIALS AND COMMENTARIES ON OIL THAT HAVE APPEARED IN RECENT EDITIONS OF KAYHAN INTERNATIONAL AND TEHRAN JOURNAL WHICH  WE ARE REPORTING AT SOME LENGTH TO GIVE FLAVOR OF LOCAL  OPINION GENERATED BY TEHRAN OPEC MEETING. \n2. ALI REZA JAHANSHAHI, IN ARTICLE ON ARRIVAL OF OIL MINISTERS IN TEHRAN IN DEC 22 TEHRAN JOURNAL (TJ)  WRITES THAT WHEN ASKED WHETHERWEST WOULD AGREE TO GUARANTEE UNINTERRUPTED SUPPLY OF EXPORTS TO OIL PRODUCERS AT  FIXED PRICE IN RELATION TO OIL, AMOUZEGAR SAID ""ONLY  WAY THIS WOULD WORK WOULD BE THROUGH AGREEMENT BETWEEN  OPEC AND OECD, WHOSE MEMBERS SUPPLY MOST OF THE GOODS OPEC MEMBERS IMPORT, AND THAT SUCH AN AGREEMENT WOULD SOLVE MANY PROBLEMS."" \n3. AMIR TAHIRI WHO IS LEADING IRANIAN JOURNALIST AND FREQUENT SPOKESMAN FOR GOI, IN DECEMBER 22 KAYHAN INTERNATIONAL (KI),  WRITES IN APPARENTLY OFFICIALZY INSPIRED COLUMN ENTITLED ""THE GREAT OIL DEBAT"" THAT SOME CONSUMERS SEE TEHRAN OPEC MEETING AS CLOAK-AND-DAGGER CONSPIRACY THREATENING END TO ""OIL-  LUBRICATED CIVILIZATION THAT HAS CREATED HITHERTO UNKNOWN WEALTH,""  AND FEEL THAT ""OIL PRODUCING NATIONS ARE THUS HOLDING THE WHOLE OF THE CIVILIZED WORLD TO RANSOM,"" WHILE SOME PRODUCERS MAY  SEE MEETING AS ""GATHERING OF REPRESENTATIVES OF COUNTIRES THAT HAVE LONG SUFFERED BRUTAL EXPLOITATION,"" BECAUSE ONLY RECENTLY HAVE THEY HAD ""ANY CLEAR VIEW OF THE VALUE OF THEIR RESOURCES,  AND THE VERY IDEA OF THESE COUNTIRES HAVING THE REAL SAY IN DE-  CIDING THE FATE OF THEIR CHIEF INDUSTRY IS STILL SO NEW AS TO BE  UNBEARABLY REVOLUTIONARY."" TAHERI COMMENTS THAT ""THE TRUE PICTURE, NO DOUBT, IS ONE THAT, WHILE TAKING SOME LINES FROM BOTH  ACCOUNTS, IS FAR FROM BEING ALARMIST."" \n4. WHILE THE INDUSTRIAL OIL CONSUMERS, WHO ""HAVE BEEN ABLE TO  CREATE AN IMPRESSIVE POWER-BASE ECONOMICALLY, POLITICALLY AND MILITARILY LARGELY THANKS TO FUEL SECURED AT RIDICULOUSLY LOW UNCLASSIFIED  PRICES,"" AND WHO HOLD AN OLIGOPOLY ON INDUSTRIAL GOODS, ARGUE THAT ""OIL-EXPORTING COUNTRIES, BEING SMALL AND TECHNICALLY BACK- WARD, ARE UNABLE TO MAKE GOOD USE OF (THEIR) GROWING FINANCIAL  RESOURCES,"" THEY STILL HAVE A LONG WAY TO GO TO ASSURE THEM-  SELVES A STANDARD OF LIVING COMPARABLE TO THAT OF EVEN THE  POOREST INDUSTRIAL NATIONS. THE OIL EXPORTERS ""ACCEPT THE  BASIC RULES OF CAPITALISM IN THE INTERNATIONAL MARKET AND SEE  ""NO REASON TO ACCEPT ARTIFICIALLY LOW PRICES...IF WE LIVE IN A  COMPETITIVE WORLD WE SHOULD, THECEFORE, ELIMINATE ALL BARRIERS TO  FREE COMPETITION."" \n5. OPEC, SAYS TAHERI, DID NOT DEVISE THIS ""LAW-OF-THE-JUNGLE""  PHILOSOPHY AND SYSTEM. ""OTHER OPTIONS SHOULD BE EXPLORED...TO BE-  LIEVE THAT THE OLD TUNE COULD CONTINUE AD INFINITUM IS...TO MUCH.  ""ONE COULD WORK OUT A NEW INTERNATIONAL SYSTEM IN WHICH BEGGARING ONES NEIGHBOR WOULD NO LONGER BE ACCEPTED AS A FACT OF LIFE. AND THE OPEC STATES HAVE...PROVED THEIR SINCERE DESIRE TO COOPERATE IN  SUCH AN ENDEAVOR. FOR YEARS THEY WERE KNOCKING ON THE DOOR OF THE RICH-NATIONS CLUB, ASKING TO BE HEARD. INSTEAD, APOLOGISTS FROM  THE LANDS OF MILK-AND-HONEY DEVELOPED THEORIES SUCH AS THE THIRD WORLD AND THE NORTH-SOUTH RIFT IN ORDER TO RATIONALISE AN ARTIFICIAL SITUATION, MAKING IT APPEAR AS SOMETHING PERMANENT AND UNTOUCHABLE. THE OIL EXPORTING NATIONS HAVE KNOWN THE FACTS FOR MANY YEARS. THEY HAVE KNOWN, FOR EXAMPLE, THAT OIL-IMPORTING GOVERNMENTS DRAW AS MUCH AS 10 TIMES FROM EACH BARREL OF OIL AS DO...OPEC MEMBERS. THEY ALSO KNOW THAT THE NOTORIOUS POLICY OF\n6. IT IS NOW TIME, SAYS TAHERI, ""TO CONCEIVE OF THE WORLD AS A SINGLE ENTITY IN WHICH PROBLEMS AND PROMISES SHOULD BE SHARED EQUALLY. ONCE THIS IS ACCEPTED, NO ONE WOULD HAVE ANY INTEREST IN  PROMOTING AN INTERNATIONAL CIVIL WAR IN WHICH THE ARMS USED WILL BE  UNCLASSIFIED  OIL AND INDUSTRIAL GOODS RESPECTIVELY...IRAN, FOR EXAMPLE, HAS  NO INTEREST IN CREATING A SITUATION SIMILAR TO THAT OF BRITAIN IN  THE LATE 50S IN WHICH THE WAGE-PRICE SPIRAL FORCED THE NATION TO  THE BRINK OF BANKRUPTCY. WE DO NOT WANT TO AMASS ABSTRACT WEALTH.  RATHER, WE WISH TO DEVELOP OUR INDUSTRIES, IMPROVE THE LIVES OF OUR PEOPLE AND BECOME A MORE INFLUENTIAL MEMBER OF THE WORLD COMMUNITY.  WE SPEND ALL OF OUR OIL INCOME AND MORE ON PURCHASING INDUSTRIAL  GOODS AND TECHNOLOGY FROM THE REST OF THE WORLD. THE RICHER WE  BECOME, THE BETTER WE WILL BE AS CUSTOMERS AND TRADE PARTNERS.  THE LOGIC OF THE SITUATION DEMANDS THAT THE WHOLE WORLD SHOULD HAVE A FRESH LOOK AT THE VERY IDEA OF GROWTH. IF NOT SHARED IN A FAIRER MANNER, GROWTH COULD BE AS DANGEROUS AS CANCER. ONE POSITIVE RESULT OF THE SO CALLED ENERGY CRISIS IS THAT MANY PEOPLE IN THE WORLD HAVE LEARNED TO APPRECIATE THE REAL VALUE OF OIL.  OIL IS NO LONGER SOMETHING ONE CONSUMES OR, WORSE, WASTES, WITHOUT GIVING IT A SECOND THOUGHT. \n7. THE TEHRAN MEETING, TAHERI WRITES, SHOULD CREATE NEITHER PANIC NOR XENOPHOBIC SENTIMENTS. ""THE WORLD IS SUFFERING FROM A  SERIOUS MALAISE CAUSED BY EXCLUSIVE CLUBS AND NARROW-MINDED SELF-  INTEREST. THE SO-CALLED ENERGY-CRISIS IS BUT ONE MANIFESTATION  OF THIS MALAISE. TO TRY AND READ MORE THAN THIS INTO WHAT IS A  BASICALLY SIMPLE ISUE WOULD BE BOTH DANGEROUS AND IRRESPONSIBLE.  THE MINISTERS WHO ARE MEETING IN TEHRAN, ARE, THEREFORE, NEITHER THE CONSPIRATORS SOME PEOPLE BELIEVE NOR THE RING-LEADERS OF A GREAT  REBELLION OF THE THIRD WORLD MASSES. THEY ARE LOGICAL MEN SEEKING A REASONABLE SOLUTION TO A PROBLEM THAT CONCERNS US ALL -- IN  TEHRAN AS WELL AS IN PARIS OR BANGKOK. WHAT IS SURE IS THAT A NEW  SYSTEM OF FIXING OIL PRICES WILL BE WORKED OUT. THE COMPANIES HAVE FAILED TO PRODUCE AN ALTERNATIVE. THE GOVERNMENTS OF IMPORTING  NATIONS HAVE NOT GONE BEYOND A FEW SUPERFICIAL OBSERVATIONS, AND THE PRESENT SITUATION IS UNTENABLE. THUS THE OPEC IS NOT ONLY RIGHT  IN SEEKING A SOLUTION BUT IS ALSO MORALLY BOUND TO DO SO. AT  THE SAME TIME IT IS PERFECTLY CLEAR THAT WE DO NOT WANT TO FORCE OUR CUSTOMERS IN THE INDUSTRIAL WORLD INTO BANKRUPTCY. NOR DO WE WISH  TO ADD TO THE BURDEN OF DEVELOPING NATIONS LACKING OIL RESOURCES  OF THEIR WON."" \n8. FORMER TJ EDITOR VAHE PETROSSIAN, IN DEC 23 TJ COLUMN, NOTES  THAT ""A GREAT SHIFT IN THE BALANCE OF POWER BETWEN THE DEVELOPING RAW MATERIALS PRODUCERS...AND THE INDUSTRIAL GIANTS IS INDEED IN  UNCLASSIFIED  PROGRESS AND THINGS WILL NOT BE THE SAME EVER AGAIN."" BUT, ASKS PETROSSIAN, WILL THE PRODUCERS RECOGNIZE ""THE NEW REALITY THAT  USE OF OIL AS A POLITICAL WEAPONS HAS BROUGHT ABOUT?....THE  WORLDS INDUSTRIAL GIANTS HAVE SEEN WHAT AMOUNTS TO THEIR DAILY  BREAD BEING WITHHELD FROM THEIR VORACIOUS BELLIES. THAT IS A  CHALLENGE TO THEIR VERY EXISTENCE--A CHALLENGE ONLY THE FOOLISH\n9. ""THE WEST, WHEN PRESSED, CAN PERFORM MIRACLES...IS IT  REASONABLE TO EXPECT THAT THIS CANNOT BE DONE WITH ENERGY RESOURCES?

economies of oil consumers which could cause a worldwide recession and which                        eventually would benefit no one including oil exportersB We believe this drastic price increase is particularly unreasonable coming                        as it does when oil supplies are being artificially restrained If this                        decision is implemented it is our preliminary assessment that the worlds                        oil bill in 1974 will more than double to about 100 billion and would be                        equal to onefifth of the value of the Free Worlds imports For the US                        alone it will add at least 10 billion to our oil import bill The                        additional import costs will be at least 23 billion for Western Europe and                        8 billion for Japan For the developing countries it will be at least 9                        billion additional This mammoth rise in costs will place an intolerable

ACTING ASSISTANT SECRETARY DAVIES CALLED IRANIAN AMBASSADOR ZAHEDI TO EXPRESS CONCERN AT REPORTS THAT USG RECEIVING ABOUT POSSIBLE INORDINATE PRICE INCREASES FOR OIL AT FORTHCOMING OPEC MEETING SCHEDULED TO BEGIN IN TEHRAN ON DECEMBER 22.  IF OPEC COUNTRIES SOUGHT TO TAKE SHORT- TERM ADVANTAGE OF SITUATION, IT WOULD CREATE CRITICAL PROBLEM BOTH FOR INDUSTRIALIZED COUNTRIES AND, ESPECIALLY, DEVELOPING COUNTRIES WHICH DO NOT HAVE THEIR OWN SOURCES OF ENERGY SUCH AS INDIA AND PAKISTAN.  US BELIEVED THAT THE MIDDLE EAST PRODUCERS SUCH AS IRAN AND SAUDI ARABIA HAD LONG-TERM INTEREST IN STABILITY OF OIL PRICES BUT IF THERE WERE A THREE-FOLD INCREASE IN REALIZED PRICES, WHICH WE UNDERSTAND SOME PRODUCERS WERE ADVOCATING, THE ADVERSE PRESSURES ON INDUSTRIALIZED ECONOMIES AND ON WORLD DEVELOP- MENT GENERALLY WOULD BE TREMENDOUS AND COULD GENERATE COUNTERMEASURES.  SLOWING OF THE DEVELOPMENTAL PROCESS WOULD HAVE IMPLICATIONS FOR STABILITY IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES WHICH COULD ONLY ADVERSELY AFFECT FREE WORLD INCLUDING IRANIAN AND SAUDI INTERESTS.\n2.  ZAHEDI SAID THAT HE HAD ALREADY SENT HIS PERSONAL VIEWS TO THE SHAH THAT THE DISRUPTION OF THE OIL PRICING SYSTEM WAS UNHEALTHY AND THAT IT WOULD BE A MISTAKE FOR OPEC TO LET OIL PRICES TO GET TOO FAR OUT OF HAND.  ZAHEDI THOUGHT, HOWEVER, THAT THE MISTAKE HAD ORIGINALLY BEEN MADE BY AMERICAN COMPANIES SUBMITTING BIDS FOR NIGERIAN OIL OF 16-18 DOLS PER BARREL.  WHILE HE COULD APPRECIATE THAT THESE PURCHASES HAD BEEN DUE PERHAPS TO FORCE MAJEURE, NEVERTHELESS, THEY HAD AFFECTED WORLD OIL PRICES GENERALLY.\n3.  ZAHEDI SAID HE WOULD TRY TO CONVEY THE DEPARTMENTS CONCERN IMMEDIATELY TO THE SHAH, WHO IS ABOUT TO LEAVE FOR HIS VACATION IN SWITZERLAND.

DEBATE WAS CUT OFF BY MOTION FOR CLOSURE AND THE COMITE ADOPTED IRISH DRAFT RES AS AMENDED BY IRAQ TO PLACE A SIMILAR ITEM ON AGENDA OF 30TH GA. US DEL ABSTAINED AND EXPLAINED VOTE. END SUMMARY.\n2. FROM OPENING OF DEBATE ON THIS SUBJECT IT WAS APPARENT THAT NO SUBSTANTIVE PROGRESS WAS LIKELY ON UN HIGH COMMISSIONER FOR HUMAN RIGHTS (HCHR) PROPOSAL AS CONTAINED IN SWEDISH/ COSTA RICAN DRAFT RES A/C.3/L.2075. IN THE GENERAL DEBATE SWEDEN, COSTA RICA, NETHERLANDS, NEW ZEALAND, BELGIUM, AND URUGUAY ARGUED VIGOROUSLY FOR FULL CONSIDERATION OF THE ITEM WITH A VIEW TOWARDS CREATING THE POST OF HCHR.\n3. THE COMPETING DRAFT RES A/C.3/L.2092, SUBMITTED BY BULGARIA AND DEMOCRATIC YEMEN, THE SOLE PURPOSE OF WHICH WAS TO KILL THE ITEM, REPRESENTED THE EXTREME NEGATIVE POSITION OF EES AND SOME ARABS. CUBA, BULGARIA, SAUDI ARABIA AND GDR SPOKE TO SUPPORT BULGARIAN DRAFT.\n4. THE MEDIAN POSITION TAKEN BY DRAFT RES A/C.3/L.2079, SUBMITTED BY IRELAND, WAS THE COORDINATED APPROACH OF THE COMMON MARKET COUNTRIES. DENMARK, IRELAND, ITALY, FRG, AND NIGERIA SPOKE IN SUPPORT OF IRISH DRAFT. WHEN IRELAND IRAQ REACHED COMPROMISE TEXT OF IRISH DRAFT RES, MOROCCO MADE A MOTION FOR CLOSURE WHICH CARRIED BY VOTE OF 69-3-24(US). MOROCCO THEN ASKED THE CHAIRMAN TO REQUEST THAT THE SWEDISH/COSTA RICAN AND BULGARIA/ YEMENI PROPOSALS NOT BE PRESSED TO VOTE. CHAIRMAN MAHMASSANI QUICKLY GAVELLED THROUGH THIS UNDERSTANDING. IRELAND ANNOUNCED FINAL TEXT OF RES.\n5. SIXTH PREAMBULAR PARA, PROPOSED BY IRAQ, (""EXPRESSING ITS HOPE THAT THE INTERNATIONAL COVENANTS ON HUMAN RIGHTS WILL ENTER INTO FORCE IN THE NEAR FUTURE"") WAS ACCEPTED. ORIGINAL OP PARA 2 OF IRISH RES WAS REPLACED TO READ ""DECIDES TO KEEP UNDER REVIEW THE CONSIDERATION OF ALTERNATIVE APPROACHES AND WAYS AND MEANS WITHIN THE UN SYSTEM FOR IMPROVING EFFECTIVE ENJOYMENT OF HUMAN RIGHTS AND FUNDA- MENTAL FREEDOMS."" OP PARA 3 AMENDED TO READ, ""DECIDES ACCORDINGLY TO INCLUDE IN THE PROVISIONAL AGENDA OF THE 30TH SESSION OF THE GA AN ITEM ENTITLED ALTERNATIVE APPROACHES AND WAYS AND MEANS WITHIN THE UN SYSTEM FOR IMPROVING THE EFFECTIVE ENJOYMENT OF HUMAN RIGHTS AND FUNDAMENTAL FREEDOMS.""\n6. ALGERIA REQUESTED A SEPARATE VOTE ON THE #30TH SESSION"" HOPING THEREBY TO POSTPONE CONSIDERATION THIS ITEM. AS THE PARA WITHOUT THE REFERENCE TO 30TH SESSION WOULD BE UNDERSTOOD TO PLACE THE ITEM ON THE AGENDA OF THE 29TH SESSION, THE RESULTING VOTE TO REATIN THESE WORDS,\n7. DURING EXPLANATION OF VOTE FOLLOWING DAY, US REP (BUKLEY) WAS FIRST TO SPEAK. HIS TEXT REPEATED AT CON- CLUSION THIS TELEGRAM. FOLLOWING DELS EXPLAINED ABSTENTIONS ON GROUNDS THAT THEY SUPPORTED CREATION OF HCHR AND THAT QUESTION OF MAKING UN HUMAN RIGHTS MACHINERY MORE EFFECTIVE WAS TOO IMPORTANT TO BE POSTPONED FOR TWO YEARS: UK, NEW ZEALAND, AFGHANISTAN (WHOSE REP ADDED UNCLASSIFIED THAT AFGHANISTAN WOULD HAVE COSPONSORED SWEDISH RES AS IN PAST HAD HE BEEN CONSULTED), NETHERLANDS, DENMARK, URUGUAY, ITALY, CANADA, AND SWEDEN.\n8. SOVIET BLOC STATES POLAND, BULGARIA AND DEMORACTIC YEMEN EXPRESSED VIEW THAT APPROPRIATE WAY TO INSURE INCREASED ENJOYMENT OF HUMAN RIGHTS WAS THROUGH ACTION BY NATIONAL GOVERNMENTS TO RATIFY AND ENFORCE HUMAN RIGHTS COVENANTS, NOT BY ESTABLISHING HCHR. SOVIETS EVER CONSCIOUS OF THEIR AFRICAN CONSTITUENCY NOTED THAT AS RESULT ADMISSION NEW STATES, ESPECIALLY AFRICAN, UN BODIES HAD CHANGED THEIR COMPOSITION AND WERE NOW DEALING WITH MORE CRUCIAL HUMAN RIGHTS PROBLEMS THAN IN PAST, I.E., RACISM, APARTHEID AND OTHER FORMS OF RACIAL DISCRIMINATION. IN DIG AT US AMONG OTHERS, SOVIET REP NOTED THAT MOST ACTIVE PARTI- SANS OF HCHR IDEA WERE THOSE COUNTRIES THAT WERE NOT SIGNATORIES TO MOST IMPORTANT HUMAN RIGHTS INSTRUMENTS. THEY CLAIMED THAT OVERWHELMING MAJORITY, HOWEVER, BELIEVED HCHR COULD DO NOTHING TO PREVENT VIOLATIONS OF HUMAN RIGHTS.\n9. THREE AFRICAN DELS SPOKE IN EXPLANATION:  MAURITANIA WHOSE REP HAD NOT BEEN PRESENT DURING VOTE MADE SARCASTIC ALLUSION TO WESTS ""INCONSISTENCY IN BEING WILLING TO FINANCE HCHR BUT UNWILLING TO FINANCE INDEPENDENT COMITE TO COORDINATE DECADE TO COMBAT RACISM AND ANNOUNCED HE WOULD HAVE ABSTAINED BECAUSE HE DID NOT WISH TO CONSIDER HCHR ITEM EVERY TWO YEARS. ZAMBIA IN CONFUSED EXPLANATION PROFESSED TO SEE THAT INTEREST OF CERTAIN DELS IN PROTECTING HUMAN RIGHTS INCREASED IN PROPORTION TO SUCCESS OF LIBERATION MOVEMENTS. SIERRE LEONE IN CONSTRUCTIVE COMMENT RECOMMENDED REGIONAL APPROACH TO ISSUE OF HUMAN RIGHTS INASMUCH AS IN THOSE COUNTRIES WHERE THERE WAS NO ASSURANCE OF RIGHT TO WORK OR ABILITY TO EARN LIVELIHOOD, CIVIL AND POLITICAL RIGHTS MUST ASSUME SECONDARY IMPORTANCE.\n0. US REP WILLIAM BUCKLEYS STATEMENT FOLLOWS:\n5. IF, AS THE SECRETARY GENERAL SAID ON A RECENT OCCASION, TO SATISFY THE HUMAN HUNGER FOR RIGHTS IS AS NECESSARY IN ITS WAY AS TO SATISFY THE HUMAN HUNGER FOR BREAD, THEN WE CAN BE HELD TO HAVE ACTED AS CALLOUSLY AS THE KEEPER OF THE GRANARY WHO WILL WAIT TWO YEARS BEFORE LISTENING TO THE SUPPLICATIONS OF THE HUNGRY.\n5.\n",686125

OUR COMMENTS ON LEWIS/LAINGEN NOVEMBER 19 LETTER ARE CONTAINED IN LETTER FROM INGRAHAM TO LEWIS, COPY OF WHICH BEING POUCHED NEA FOR LAINGEN. SUBSTANCE THESE COMMENTS AS FOLLOWS:\n2. WE FULLY SHARE CONCERN EXPRESSED BY LEWIS OVER PRESENT STATE PAK/AFGHAN RELATIONS, RECOGNIZING THAT    SECRET\n3. REVIEW CONFIRMS OUR EARLIER ASSESSMENT THAT CALCULATED PAK ATTACK ON AFGHANISTAN MOST UNLIKELY. BHUTTO AND OTHERS IN GOP HIERARCHY ARE ANNOYED AT WHAT THEY SEE AS GOA MEDDLING IN PAKISTANS DOMESTIC AFFAIRS, BUT THERE IS NO EVIDENCE ANY INTENT TO PRECIPITATE FIGHT WITH AFGHANS. TO BEST OUR KNOWLEDGE, GOP STRATEGY (INCLUDING TROOP REDEPLOYMENTS AND BHUTTOS RECENT VERBAL BARRAGE) IS DESIGNED DISSUADE AFGHANS FROM THEIR COURSE RATHER THAN ESTABLISHING PRETEXT FOR ATTACKING THEM.\n4. DEFATT AND ARMA HAVE CONSIDERED CAREFULLY COMMENTS IN LEWIS LETTER, INCLUDING ASSESSMENT BY LOUIS DUPREE. THEY HAVE SEEN NO EVIDENCE ANY APPRECIABLE SENTIMENT IN PAK ARMY OR AIR FORCE FOR MOVE AGAINST AFGHANISTAN TO ERASE HUMILIATION OF 1971 DEFEAT. THEY DO NOT BELIEVE THIS IDEA ENJOYS ANY SUPPORT WHATEVER AMONG LEADERSHIP PAK ARMED FORCES. MOREOVER, ALL INDICATIONS ARE THAT MILITARY REMAINS RESPONSIVE TO BHUTTOS CONTROL AND WOULD NOT EMBARK ON SUCH ADVENTURE AGAINST HIS WISHES.\n5. WITH REGARD BABARS CLAIM THAT BHUTTO BELIEVES WE WOULD SUPPORT HIM IN MILITARY ACTION AGAINST AFGHANISTAN, WE HAVE CONSISTENTLY STRESSED TO PRIMIN OUR ABIDING INTEREST IN PEACEFUL RESOLUTION PAK/AFGHAN DISPUTE AND WE HAVE NO REASON TO BELIEVE MESSAGE HAS FAILED TO REGISTER WITH BHUTTO. ON OTHER HAND, ALTHOUGH BHUTTO QUITE CERTAINLY KNOWS WE WOULD OPPOSE PAK MILITARY INITIATIVE AGAINST AFGHANISTAN, WE EXPECT HE DOES ASSUME USG ISGENERALLY SYMPATHETIC TO PAK POSITION ON PUSH- TUNISTAN IN VIEW OUR UNQUALIFIED RECOGNITION DURAND LINE AND PRESIDENT NIXONS STATEMENT IDENTIFYING TERRITORIAL INTEGRITY OF PAKISTAN AS GUIDING PRINCIPLE US FOREIGN POLICY.\n6. OUR OWN CONCERN IS TO SOME EXTENT MIRROR IMAGE OF THAT EXPRESSED BY LEWIS RE BHUTTO. WE CONTINUE TO WONDER WHETHER DAOUD IS FULLY AWARE THAT USG WOULD NOT FAOVR ANY ATTEMPT REDRAW PAK/AFGHAN BORDER WITHOUT FREELY- EXPRESSED CONSENT OF GOP.\n7. AS TO SOURCES CITED BY LEWIS, EMBOFFS HERE WHO ARE ACQUAINTED WITH BABAR CONSIDER HIM REASONABLY INTELLIGENT BUT NOT ESPECIALLY PERCEPTIVE YOUNG MAN, WITH STRONG PRO-PATHAN SENTIMENTS AND NOT TOO MUCH INSIGHT INTO CURRENT THINKING IN ISLAMABAD.

PAKISTANI AMBASSADOR ISPAHANI MADE HIS RETURN PROTOCOLARY CALL ON ME DECEMBER 27 AND BENT MY EAR AT LENGTH ON PAK-AFGHAN RELATIONS. HE SAID THAT AT TIME OF MAIWANDWAL COUP ATTEMPT, TEMPERATURE OF RELATIONSHIP FELL TO ZERO, SUBSEQUENTLY ROSE TO ABOUT 70 BUT, IN WAKE OF BHUTTOS TOUR OF NWFP HAD GONE DOWN TO 25. AFGHAN OFFICIALS REFUSE ISPAHANIS SOCIAL INVITATIONS, AND HIS REQUESTS CONFIDENTIAL FOR COURTESY CALLS ON TOP AFGHAN OFFICIALS HAVE GONE UNANSWERED.\n2. REGARDING ABORTED VISIT OF MUMTAZ ALI BHUTTO, ISPAHANI SAID AFGHAN FONMIN OFFICIAL A WEEK OR TWO AGO HAD COMPLAINED THAT AFGHANISTAN HAD NOT RECEIVED AN INVITATION TO THE ISLAMIC CONFERENCE, IN CONTRAST TO OTHER MOSLEM COUNTRIES WHICH HAD BEEN INVITED BY SPECIAL ENVOYS. WHEN THIS WAS REPORTED BY ISPAHANI, GOP ASKED HIM TO INQUIRE IF GOA WOULD RECEIVE M.A. BHUTTO AS CONVEYER OF THE INVITATION. ISPAHANI HAD A SUBORDINATE OFFICIAL OF HIS EMBASSY MAKE THIS INQUIRY AS THE ORIGINAL AFGHAN COMPLAINT CAME FROM A SUBORDINATE LEVEL OF THE FONMIN. AFGHAN RESPONSE WAS, AS WAHID ABDULLAH TOLD ME YESTERDAY, GOA REQUIRED NO INVITATION. ISPAHANI THEREUPON RECOMMENDED TO ISLAMABAD THAT M.A. BHUTTO VISIT BE SCRUBBED, WHICH IT HAS BEEN. AMUSING SIDELIGHT, HOWEVER, BUT NOT FOR ISPAHANI OR ABDULLAH, IS MIXUP WHICH LED PIA TO INFORM BOTH OF THEM M.A. BHUTTO WAS ARRIVING YESTERDAY AND CAUSED ISPAHANI BUT NO AFGHAN OFFICIAL TO MEET THE BHUTTO-LESS AIRPLANE.\n3. REGARDING THE TRIBAL MIGRATION, ISPAHANI SAID HE HAS RECOMMENDED TO ISLAMABAD THAT A TOKEN NUMBER, ABOUT TEN OR FIFTEEN THOUSAND, BE ALLOWED INTO PAKISTAN THIS SEASON, BUT THAT IT BE MADE CLEAR TO GOA THAT THIS DOES NOT ESTABLISH A PRECEDENT.\n4. ISPAHANI STRUCK ME AS A TOUGH, WILY CHARACTER, AND AS I GET TO KNOW HIM BETTER I UNDERSTAND BETTER WHY BHUTTO WANTS HIM HERE. HE IS ABSOLUTELY RIGID ON THE PUSHTUNISTAN QUESTION (""WHEN THE AFGHANS TELL ME THEIR CLAIM GOES BACK TO 1738, I TELL THEM THE PRESENT BORDER WILL STILL STAND IN 2138""), SAYS HE WILL RESIGN THE DAY HE IS EVER ASKED TO DISCUSS THE MATTER WITH ANY AFGHAN AND WOULD THEN RETURN HOME ""AND RAISE HELL"", AND TELLS ME HE HAS RECOMMENDED INTENSIVE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS RIGHT UP TO THE BORDER INSIDE PAKISTAN.\n5. ISPAHANI SAID HE BELIEVES THE DAOUD REGIMES HARPING ON PUSHTUNISTAN REFLECTS ITS INTERNAL WEAKNESS. HE REFERRED TO DAOUD AS A ""TROUBLED"" MAN AND COMMENTED THAT HE, ISPAHANI, PERSONALLY HOPES DAOUD STAYS IN CONTROL HERE BECAUSE ANY ALTERNATIVE WOULD BE WORSE AND PROBABLY SOVIET-CONTROLLED. HE EXPRESSED ADMIRATION FOR DAOUDS INCORRUPTIBILITY. HE DISMISSES WAHID ABDULLAH WITH THE COMMENT THAT HE HAS JUST BEEN PROMOTED FROM SECOND SECRETARY AND DOES ONLY WHAT HE IS TOLD. SO THE ISPAHANI-ABDULLAH SOCIETY IS CONFIDENTIAL CERTAINLY MUTUAL. ELIOT\n",681899

WHILE WE MUST, OF COURSE, AWAIT FURTHER VERIFICATION BY AMBASSADOR ELIOT IN KABUL, I AM EXTEMELY CONCERNED BY THE WORD THAT SOMEWHAT OVER 850 SOVIET TANKS MAY BE HEADED FOR AFGHANISTAN AS TENTATIVELY REPORTED IN KABUL 8311. WHILE I AGREE THAT AFGHANISTANS COULD NOT QUICKLY MAN AND EFFECTIVELY UTILIZE THIS AMOUNT OF ARMAMENT, I WOULD EXPECT AN IMMEDIATE AND EXTREME REACTION ON THE PART OF BHUTTO, AND INDEED THE SHAH OF IRAN, WHEN AND IF THEY GET THE WORD. A MOVE OF THIS MAGNITUDE WOULD AT THE VERY LEAST LEAD TO EXTREME SENSITIVITY IN THE WHOLE UNDER-BELLY OF RUSSIA, EXTENDING AT A MINIMUM FROM IRAN TO INDIA. IF THIS REPORT TURNS OUT TO BE TRUE, I SUGGEST YOU HAVE AN ITEM FOR SOVIET CONSULATIONS HIGH    SECRET  ON YOUR AGENDA, EVEN IF IT CAN ACCOMPLISH NO OTHER PURPOSE THAN TO TRY TO ASCERTAIN JUST HOW FAR DOWN THIS ROAD THEY PLAN TO GO.\n2. ONE OF MY GREATEST HOPES IN COMING HERE WAS TO FACILITATE AS I COULD THE SIMLA ATMOSPHERE WITH INDIA. THIS IS A STRONG ARGUMENT FOR OUR PRESENT ARMS POLICY IN THE SUB-CONTINENT AS DIFFICULT AS I KNOW THAT THAT WILL MAKE LIFE HERE. I HAVE IN FACT SPENT CONSIDERABLE TIME DECIDING HOW BEST TO TRY TO PLACATE BHUTTO ON THIS SUBJECT. OUR PRESENT ARMS POLICY IS OF COURSE AS IT IS SOLELY BECAUSE OF INDIA, AND THE HOPE THAT IN THE LONG RUN SECURITY CAN BEST BE ACCOMPLISHED BY IMPROVED INDIA-PAK RELATIONS. BUT IF THIS TENTATIVE KABUL REPORT IS VERIFIED, AND AT THE WORST OTHER SUPPORTING ARMAMENT IS TO FOLLOW, IT MAY WELL TURN OUT THAT THIS POLICY WOULD BECOME UNTENABLE, AT LEAST IF WE EXPECT AND HOPE TO MAINTAIN GOOD RELATIONS HERE IN PAKISTAN. IF THE SOVIETS ARE INDEED WILLING TO STRENGTHEN AND SUPPORT DAOUD TO THIS EXTENT, WITH HIS PUBLICLY EXPRESSED DESIGNS RE PAKISTAN TERRITORY, WE MIGHT RELUCTANTLY CONCLUDE THAT A COMPLETE REVIEW OF OUR POLICY IN THIS ENTIRE AREA WOULD BE IN ORDER.\n3. I TEND TO AGREE WITH EMBASSY KABUL THAT DAOUD IS PROBABLY THINKING OF HISTORY AND LONG-RANGE PLANS RATHER THAN IMMEDIATE ACTION. ALSO, I WOULD AGREE THAT AFGHANISTAN, EVEN WITH SUCH A SUPPLEMENT OF ARMS, WOULD NOT HAVE THE CAPABLILTY OF TACKLING PAKISTAN AT AN EARLY DATE, ALTHOUGH THEIR TANK FORCE WOULD APPROACH PARITY WITH THAT OF THE PAKS TOO CLOSELY FOR COMFORT. I AM NOT, HOWEVER AT ALL SURE THAT PAKISTAN, AND POSSIBLY IRAN, WOULD HAVE SO COMPLACENT A VIEW IF AND WHEN THEY RECEIVE THEIR OWN INTELLIGENCE REPORT ON THIS POSSIBLE DEVELOPMENT. SUCH A MOVE AS THIS WOULD FIT SO COMPLETELY INTO VIEWS OFTEN EXPRESSED TO US BY BOTH BHUTTO AND THE SHAH AS TO SOVIET LONG RANGE INTENTIONS (WHICH INVOLVE AFGHANISTAN) IN THIS AREA, THAT IT WOULD BE WELL NIGH IMPOSSIBLE TO CONVINCINGLY ATTEMPT TO TALK THEM DOWN.

REMARKS ABOUT REGIONAL STABILITY NAIM SAID THAT HE WISHED                            AFGHANISTAN COULD ALSO IMPROVE ITS RELATIONS WITH PAKISTAN BUT THAT HE                            FOUND THE GOP INCREASINGLY MORE DIFFICULT TO DEAL WITH IN THIS                            CONNECTIONS HE SAID THAT AFGHANISTAN HAS NO DESIRE TO SEE PAKISTAN                            DISINTEGRATE11 I USED THIS

WOULD BE VERY USEFUL FOR ME TO HAVE A SIMILAR                            CONVERSATION WITH DAOUD AND THAT                            HE WOULD TRY TO ARRANGE FOR SUCH A CONVERSATION AFTER MY RETURN

I CALLED ON PRESIDENT DAOUDS BROTHER NAIM ON DEC 12 IN THE FOREIGN MINISTRY, WHERE HE RECEIVES VISITORS IN A WAY WHICH MAKES IT CLEAR THAT HE IS IN EFFECT FOREIGN MINISTER. DEPUTY FONMIN ABDULLAH WAS PRESENT AS A NOTE TAKER. CONFIDENTIAL 2. DURING THE EARLY PART OF THE CONVERSATION, A TANGENTIAL REFERENCE BY NAIM TO AFGHANISTANS DIFFICULTIES WITH PAKISTAN AND IRAN GAVE ME AN OPPORTUNITY TO INITIATE A LONGER DISCUSSION OF THESE PROBLEMS. I TOLD NAIM THAT PRESIDENT NIXON AND SECRETARY KISSINGER STRONGLY BELIEVE THAT PROBLEMS BETWEEN COUNTRIES SHOULD BE RESOLVED THROUGH DIRECT DISCUSSIONS, POINTING OUT THAT WE HAD PRACTICED THIS APPROACH IN OUR RELATIONS WITH USSR, THE PRC, AND NORTH VIETNAM, AND HAD MADE A GREAT EFFORT TO BRING ABOUT DIRECT TALKS BETWEEN THE ARABS AND ISRAEL. I SAID THAT WE APPROACH AFGHANISTANS PROBLEMS WITH IRAN AND PAKISTAN IN THE SAME WAY.\n3. NAIM SAID THAT AFGHANISTANS RELATIONS WITH IRAN ARE IN REASONABLY GOOD SHAPE. HE SAID THAT AFGHANISTAN WAS, HOWEVER, AWARE THAT THE IRANIANS HAVE SOME MISGIVINGS ABOUT LAST JULYS COUP. HE ALSO SAID THAT THE GOA IS CONCERNED ABOUT IRANS SUPPORT OF THE PAKISTANIS IN BALUCHISTAN, ADDING THAT HE FULLY UNDERSTANDS THE SHAHS DESIRE TO DETER ANY BALUCHI AGITATION WITHIN IRAN. I TOOK THE OPPORTUNITY TO SAY THAT I HAD BEEN PLEASED TO LEARN THAT DEP FONMIN ABDULLAH MIGHT VISIT IRAN EN ROUTE TO PRAGUE NEXT MONTH. COMMENT: AMBASSADOR HELMS MIGHT WISH TO PURSUE THE MATTER OF THE ABDULLAH VISIT WITH THE GOI WITH A VIEW TO MAKING IT PRESTIGIOUS AND THEREFORE AS PRODUCTIVE AS POSSIBLE. ABDULLAH IS SENSITIVE TO THE LEVEL AND PROTOCOLARY ASPECTS OF THE TREATMENT HE RECEIVES.\n4. NAIM ALSO TREATED ME TO A LENGTH HISTORICAL ACCOUNT OF THE PUSHTUNISTAN ISSUE, GOING OVER HIS OWN EFFORTS WHILE HE WAS FONMIN AT ENGAGING IN DIRECT TALKS WITH THE PAKISTANIS, ALL OF WHICH, IN HIS VIEW, CAME TO NAUGHT BECAUSE THE PAKISTANIS WERE NOT INTERESTED IN FRUITFUL DISCUSSIONS. NAIMS FORMULATION ON PRESENT AFGHAN POLICY WAS A LITTLE DIFFERENT FROM THE ONE HE GAVE ME WHEN WE LAST MET (KABUL 8106). IN EFFECT, HE SAID AFGHANISTAN HAS ALWAYS BEEN AND CONTINUES TO BE CONTENT WITH ANY ARRANGEMENT FOR THE PUSHTUNS IN PAKISTAN WHICH IS SATISFACTORY TO THE PUSHTUNS THEMSELVES. HE SAID THAT THE CURRENTLY, AS HE TERMED THEM, REPRESSIVE POLICIES OF THE BHUTTO GOVERNMENT ARE NOT ""CONSTRUCTIVE"" IN TERMS OF PAKISTANI-AFGHAN RELATIONS. HE ADDED THAT IF THESE ""REPRESSIVE"" POLICIES SHOULD CAUSE THE SITUATION IN THE PUSHTUNISTAN AREAS OF PAKISTAN GREATLY TO WORSEN, AFGHANISTAN COULD NOT AVOID CONFIDENTIAL ""MIXING"" IN THE SITUATION. NAIM ASKED THAT I GIVE AMBASSADOR BYROADE HIS WARMEST PERSONAL REGARDS. HE SAID THAT HE WAS CERTAIN THAT AMB BYROADE, BEING SO FAMILIAR WITH AFGHANISTANS VIEWPOINT, WOULD BE ABLE TO BE HELPFUL IN THIS SITUATION.\n5. I RESPONDED THAT WE HAD, AS HE KNEW IN RECENT WEEKS COUNSELLED THE PAKISTANIS BOTH TO ESTABLISH BETTER DIPLOMATIC COMMUNICATION WITH AFGHANISTAN AND ALSO NOT TO TAKE STEPS WHICH WOULD EXACERBATE THE SITUATION. I ADDED, HOWEVER, THAT I WAS CERTAIN NAIM WOULD NOT WANT AMB BYROADE TO BE THE AFGHAN AMBASSADOR IN PAKISTAN, A COMMENT WHICH BROUGHT AN UNDERSTANDING SMILE FROM NAIM, AND THAT I HOPED THAT THE AFGHANS WOULD DO EVERYTHING THEY COULD TO IMPROVE DIRECT DIPLOMATIC COMMUNICATION. IN THIS CONNECTION, THE CURRENT KUCHI (NOMAD) PROBLEM WAS MENTIONED BRIEFLY BY ADBULLAH, WHICH GAVE ME AN OPPORTUNITY TO SPELL OUT IN SOME MORE DETAIL AMB BYROADES ATTITUDE AS GIVEN IN ISLAMABAD 10613 (NOTAL). I ONCE AGAIN SUGGESTED THAT AMB POPAL STAY IN CLOSE TOUCH WITH AMB BYROADE. COMMENT: IT IS DIFFICULT TO SEE ANY RAYS OF SUNSHINE IN THIS PROBLEM AT THE PRESENT TIME, ESPECIALLY IN LIGHT OF INFORMATION BEING REPORTED SEPTEL THAT THE PAKISTANIS HAVE DECIDED NOT TO PERMIT THE KUCHIS TO ENTER PAKISTAN THIS SEASON.

MINISTER IT WAS CLEAR FROM HIS                            DESCRIPTION OF THIS PERIOD THAT HE AND NO DOUBT HIS BROTHER ALSO                            CONTINUE TO HARBOR DISAPPOINTMENT ABOUT OUR PAST

IN MY MEETING WITH NAIM DEC 12, I BEGAN BY SETTING FORTH  AS OUTLINED PARA 4, REF A MY REACTION TO THE ""EVIDENCE"" OF US INVOLVEMENT IN THE MAIWANDWAL COUP ATTEMPT. NAIM RESPONDED BY SAYING THAT AFGHANISTAN WANTS CLOSE AND FRIENDLY RELATIONS WITH THE US AND THAT IT HAD BEEN IN THAT SPIRIT THAT HE HAD MADE  AVAILABLE TO ME THE DOCUMENTS AND TAPE. HE AGREED THAT THEY DID NOT CONSTITUTE FIRST-HAND EVIDENCE, ADDING THAT THE ONLY PERSON  WHO MIGHT HAVE PROVIDED SUCH EVIDENCE, MAIWANDWAL HIMSELF, HAD COMMITTED SUICIDE BEFORE TELLING HIS STORY. NAIM WENT ON TO SAY THAT HE BELIEVES THAT AFGHANISTANS NEIGHBOR TO THE SOUTH HAS AN INTEREST IN DISTURBING RELATIONS BETWEEN THE US AND AFGHANISTAN. I CONCLUDED BY SAYING I WAS GLAD TO NOTE THAT HE AGREED THERE    SECRET  WAS NO EVIDENCE OF US INVOLVEMENT IN MAIWANDWALS EFFORTS.\n2. COMMENT: I HAVE NOT BEEN HERE LONG ENOUGH TO BE CERTAIN THAT THIS SPECIFIC INCIDENT IS NOW OVER, BUT MY GUESS IS THAT IT IS AT LEAST FOR THE TIME BEING. IT IS ALSO A LITTLE EARLY FOR ME TO BE CERTAIN WHY WHAT IS CLEARLY NOT EVIDENCE WAS PUT TO ME. THE REASONS GIVEN IN PARA 2, REF B, ARE ALL POSSIBLE, ALTHOUGH I  WOULD LIST THEIR ORDER OF PROBABILITY FROM C TO B TO A. IN  ADDITION, THIS EPISODE GAVE THE GOA AN OPPORTUNITY TO MUDDY THE WATERS BETWEEN US AND THE PAKISTANIS. I HAVE EVERY REASON TO BELIEVE, HOWEVER, THAT DAOUD AND NAIM ARE SINCERE IN WANTING TO  HAVE CLOSE RELATIONS WITH THE US, ESPECIALLY OF COURSE WHEN IT  COMES TO MATTERS LIKE ECONOMIC ASSITANCE AND DIPLOMATIC ASSISTANCE VIS-A-VIS PAKISTAN. A BY-PRODUCT OF THIS EXCHANGE WAS THE  OPPORTUNITY IT GAVE ME TO ESTABLISH A RELATIONSHIP WITH NAIM. ELIOT\n",682348

COULD SAY IT AGAIN SEVERAL TIMES IF HE WISHED BUT HOPED OUR                            ACTIONS WOULD SPEAK LOUDER THAN OUR WORDS THIS DREW ONE OF THE FEW                            SMILES FROM HIM IN AN OTHERWISE SERIOUS CONVERSATION10 AS I WAS LEAVING I EXPRESSED MY HOPE THAT HE WOULD HAVE A SUCCESSFUL                            TRIP TO NORTH AFRICA HE SAID THAT HE WOULD BE LEAVING MARCH 26 FOR                            IRAQ LIBYA AND EGYPT BUT THAT THE ALGERIANS ARE SO BUSY PRESUMABLY                            WITH THE NONALIGNED CONFERENCE THAT HE MIGHT NOT VISIT ALGERIA HE                            SAID THAT HE WOULD BE VISITING IRAN IN EARLY MAY AND SPOKE                            OPTIMISTICALLY ABOUT AFGHANISTANS RELATIONS WITH IRAN PICKING UP MY                            EARLIER REMARKS ABOUT REGIONAL STABILITY NAIM SAID THAT HE WISHED                            AFGHANISTAN COULD ALSO IMPROVE ITS RELATIONS WITH PAKISTAN BUT THAT HE                            FOUND THE GOP INCREASINGLY MORE DIFFICULT TO DEAL WITH IN THIS                            CONNECTIONS HE SAID THAT AFGHANISTAN HAS NO DESIRE TO SEE PAKISTAN                            DISINTEGRATE11 I USED THIS OPPORTUNITY TO BRIEF NAIM PER STATE 54992 ON THE MIDDLE EAST SITUATION FOR                            WHICH HE WAS GRATEFUL12 IN CONCLUSION NAIM SAID THAT                            HE BELIEVES IT

SINCE EACH OF YOU PROBABLY WILL HAVE OPPORUNITY IN NEAR FUTURE TO DISCUSS CURRENT STATE PAK-AFGHAN RELATIONS, WE CONSIDER THIS OPPORTUNE MOMENT TO REVIEW BRIEFLY USG ATTITUDE TOWARD PROBLEM.  DESPITE RESTRAINED EXPRESSION ON CONFIDENTIAL  PUSHTUNISTAN BY NAIM TO AMBASSADOR ELIOT (REFTEL B), WE CONTINUE TO BE TROUBLED OVER SITUATION BECAUSE OF RECENT DEVELOPMENTS IN TWO COUNTRIES, INCLUDING:         (A) REPORTS OF MILITARY ""ALERTS"" IN BOTH COUNTRIES.;       (B) HARDLINE RHETORIC OF BHUTTO DURING RECENT TOUR OF NWFP AND ADVERSE AFGHAN REACTION;       (C) RECENT ARMS SHIPMENTS OF APPARENTLY SIGNIFICANT NATURE FROM USSR INTO AFGHANISTAN. THIS MESSAGE ALSO REFLECTS CONCERNS RECENTLY EXPRESSED INFORMALLY BY EMBASSY KABUL (NOTAL) THAT SOME PAK SOURCES TALKING OF POSSIBLE GOP PRE-EMPTIVE MEASURES AGAINST AFGHANISTAN, SHOULD GOA FURNISH SUFFICIENT ""PROVOCATION"".  \n2.  USG OBJECTIVES AND BASIC POSITION TOWARD PAK-AFGHAN   CONFLICT REMAIN  AS OUTLINED REFTEL PARAS FOUR THROUGH EIGHT.  WE CONTINUE TO BELIEVE THAT NEITHER SIDE IS ADEQUATELY COMMUNICATING WITH OTHER, WHETHER DELIBERATELY SO OR BY DEFAULT, AND THAT PLAYING OF HARD LINE BY BOTH SIDES COULD TRIGGER STEPS THAT WOULD UPSET FRAGILE STABILITY IN AREA, WITH IMPLICATIONS FOR INVOLVEMENT OF OUTSIDE POWERS.  ALTHOUGH NEITHER COUNTRY SO FAR HAS BEEN WILLING TO INITIATE STEPS TO DEFUSE TENSIONS, WE BELIEVE IT WORTHWHILE TO CONTINUE EMPHASIZE THEME THAT AT MINIMUM BOTH SIDES SHOULD CONSIDER IMPROVING THEIR CONTACTS, RATHER THAN SETTING FORCES OF CONFRONTATION IN MOTION.  \n3.  FOR AMBASSADOR ELIOT:  WE ARE MILDLY ENCOURAGED BY NAIMS FORMULATION EXPRESSING HOPE THAT PAKISTAN WOULD HANDLE PUSHTUN PROBLEM IN WAY THAT WOULD ""PREVENT THE SITUATIONFROM BECOMING ONE IN WHICH AFGHANISTAN WOULD  HAVE TO INVOLVE ITSELF."" THAT AT LEAST IS AN UNDERSTANDABLE EXPRESSION OF GOA POLICY ON THE ISSUE.  WE RECOGNIZE, OF COURSE, THAT NAIM TENDS TO PUSH SOFTER LINE THAN DAOUD. LATTER HOWEVER IS ALSO ON RECORD AS SEEKING PEACEFUL RESOLUTION PUSHTUNISTAN ""PROBLEM"".  IF THAT IS TO BE ACHIEVED BY PARTIES CONCERNED WE WANT DAOUD TO APPRECIATE OUR VIEW THAT BOTH SIDES CAN CONTRIBUTE BY COOLING OF RHETORIC AND OTHER STEPS THAT WOULD EASE TENSIONS TO POINT WHERE DIALOGUE WOULD BE PRODUCTIVE.  WE HOPE YOU WILL CONFIDENTIAL  FIND WAYS IN NEAR FUTURE TO REITERATE OUR BELIEF THAT BOTH SIDES COULD TAKE STEPS DESIGNED EASE TENSIONS.  \n4.  DEPARTMENT WOULD ALSO APPRECIATE KABULS EVALUATION OF CURRENT SOVIET MILITARY HARDWARE SHIPMENTS INTO AFGHANISTAN. WE WOULD LIKE TO HAVE YOUR JUDGEMENT AS TO WHETHER THIS IS RESUPPLY AND REPLACEMENT EFFORT OR WHETHER NEW SHIPMENTS GIVE AFGHAN MILITARY ANY NEW OFFENSIVE OR DEFENSIVE CAPABILITY.  \n5.  FOR AMBASSADOR BYROADE:  WE LEAVE TO YOUR DISCRETION HOW STRONGLY YOU WISH TO EMPHASIZE OUR CONCERNS DURING YOUR INITIAL MEETING WITH BHUTTO. HOWEVER, YOUR LONG AND INTIMATE INVOLVE- MENT IN PAKISTAN-AFGHAN RELATIONS IN PAST PROVIDES BASIS FOR A PERSPECTIVE AND A FRANKNESS ON THIS SUBJECT WITH BHUTTO THAT WE BELIEVE IS IN ORDER FOR YOUR FIRST MEETING. AS FOR THE ISSUE ITSELF, OUR SUPPORT FOR PAKISTANS INTEGRITY IS CLEAR AND ON THE RECORD.  WE APPRECIATE GOP VIEW THAT AFGHAN PUSHTUNISTAN POLICY AMOUNTS TO REFUSAL TO RECOGNIZE PAKISTAN SOVEREIGNTY AND THAT THIS IS TOTALLY UNACCEPTABLE.  AT SAME TIME WE WANT BHUTTO TO UNDERSTAND OUR CONCERN THAT EXTENT TO WHICH DAOUD PERSISTS   IN PRESENT HARD LINE WILL BE AT LEAST PARTIALLY DETERMINED BY GOP POSTURE, INCLUDING MANNER AND EXTENT OF PAKISTAN MILITARY DEPLOYMENTS IN FRONTIER AREA.  WE, OF COURSE, DO NOT BELIEVE DAOUD POSES A SUBSTANTIAL MILITARY THREAT, DESPITE CURRENT REPORTS OF NEW SOVIET MILITARY SHIPMENTS TO AFGHANISTAN.  FRANKLY, WE STILL HAVE NO EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT CONCLUSION THAT SOVIETS ARE BEHIND DAOUDS CURRENT PUSHTINISTAN LINE, AND WE ALSO TAKE SOME SATISFACTION IN INDICATIONS THAT INDIANS HAVE COUNSELED RESTRAINT ON DAOUD.  FINALLY, WE HOPE YOU WILL FIND WAYS TO INDICATE TO BHUTTO OUR VIEW THAT EXTENT TO WHICH HE CAN PRESS AHEAD WITH GENUINE POLITICAL ACCOMMODA- TION WITH OPPOSITION ELEMENTS IN FRONTIER WILL BE MORE DECISIVE THAN ANYTHING ELSE IN REMOVING ANY BASIS FOR AFGHAN ""MEDDLING"".  NO ONE KNOWS THAT BETTER THAN BHUTTO HIMSELF, BUT THAT NEED NOT PRECLUDE OUR INDICATING THAT WE FEEL THAT WAY TOO. CONFIDENTIAL  6.

130,0.9727293580123613,Document not declassified in time for publication,frus1969-76ve08d153,"1. SUMMARY: WE ASSUME THAT THE GAO REPORT, WHEN RELEASED, WILL BE PICKED UP BY THE THAI PRESS. THERE ARE SEVERAL IMPORTANT POINTS IN THE DRAFT REPORT WHICH IN OUR VIEW ARE NOT OBJECTIVE, COMPLETE, AND/OR ATTUNED TO THAI TE SENSITIVITIES. THESE POINTS WOULD NOT PROMOTE HERE GAOS OBJECTIVES OF EFFICIENCY AND ECONOMY; RATHER THEY WOULD LEND THEMSELVES TO EXPLOITATION BY THAI CRITICS OF THE AMERICAN PRESENCE. EMBASSY, THEREFORE, RECOMMENDS THAT DEPARTMENT MAKE EFFORT TO PERSUADE GAO TO EDIT, DELETE, OR AT LEAST CLASSIFY THESE POINTS. END SUMMARY.\n2. PARTICULARLY TROUBLESOME POINTS, WHICH WILL BE DIS- CUSSED INDIVIDUALLY, ARE:\n6.\n3. THE PRESENT INTERIM RTG HAS ITS HANDS FULL TRYING TO COPE WITH SERIOUS DOMESTIC UNREST AND AT SAME TIME PRE- PARE FOR TRANSITION TO CONSTITUTIONAL CIVILIAN GOVERNMENT. IT HAS SOLICITED OUR COOPERATION IN TRYING TO KEEP THE AMERICAN MILITARY PRESENCE FROM BECOMING ANOTHER BURNING PUBLIC ISSUE IN THIS DIFFICULT PERIOD. POINTS A, B, AND C WOULD, IF PICKED UP BY THE THAI PRESS, BE MOST UNHELPFUL IN THIS REGARD.\n4. SPECULATION IN AN OFFICIAL US DOCUMENT THAT THERE WILL PROBABLY BE A ""LARGE"" US PRESENCE HERE ""WELL INTO THE FUTURE"" WOULD UNDERCUT THE FREQUENTLY EXPRESSED RTG POSITION THAT CONTINUANCE OF THE US PRESENCE IS SUBJECT TO THAI APPROVAL WHICH IN TURN WILL BE DECIDED ON BASIS OF RTG ASSESSMENT OF THAI SECURITY INTERESTS. EMBASSY INFORMED GAO THAT WE HAD NO FIRM GUIDANCE ON THE LONGER- TERM PRESENCE WHICH, IN ANY CASE, IS SUBJECT TO NUMBER OF IMPONDERABLES ON BOTHTHAI AND US SIDES.\n5. IMPLIED CRITICISM OF RTG FOR IMPOSING CONSTRAINTS IN SPITE OF FINANCIAL BENEFITS WOULD WIN US LITTLE OR NO SYMPATHY FROM NATIONALIST-MINDED THAI BUT RATHER WOULD STIMULATE RENEWED OUTBURSTS FROM THE MANY ARTICULATE CRITICS OF THE US PRESENCE WHO HAVE ALREADY CONTENDED THAT THE RTG HAS BEEN OVERLY LIBERAL IN ITS DEALINGS WITH THE US. IT WOULD ALSO STIMULATE THOSE CRITICS WHO CONFIDENTIAL HAVE QUESTIONED THE OVERALL EFFECTS OF THE AMERICAN PRESENCE IN TERMS OF THAI INTERESTS TO CHALLENGE THE GAO REASONING.\n6. THE THANOM GOVERNMENT HAD ALREADY INITIATED NEGOTIATIONS WITH US DESIGNED TO REDUCE THE LARGE NUMBERS OF FOREIGN CONTRACTOR PERSONNEL WE HAVE IN THAILAND AND TO INCREASE OPPORTUNITIES FOR THAI FIRMS. OTHER NEGOTIATIONS WERE INITIATED TO INSTITUTE TIGHTER CONTROLS AND LIMITATIONS ON US IMPORTS OF DUTY-FREE GOODS. THERE IS EVERY REASON TO ANTICIPATE THAT THE PRESENT INTERIM GOVERNMENT AND ANY GOVERNMENT LIKELY TO SUCCEED IT WILL CONTINUE THIS TREND OF REQUIRING MORE CONSTRAINTS, NOT LESS, ON A WIDE RANGE OF MATTERS ASSOCIATED WITH OUR MILITARY PRESENCE. MACTHAI AND THE EMBASSY ARE RESISTING NEW CONSTRAINTS WHICH WOULD SERIOUSLY AFFECT OUR ESSENTIAL MILITARY REQUIREMENTS. WE FACE A SERIOUS CHALLENGE IN TRYING TO NEGOTIATE PRESERVATON OF MANY LIBERAL ARRANGEMENTS WE NOW ENJOY. THE CLIMATE IS, THEREFORE, NOT NEW PROPITIOUS FOR NEGOTIATING MORE LIBERAL ARRANGEMENTS.\n7. IN OUTLINING THE EMBASSYS POSITION ON ""RESISTANCE"" TO RTG CONSTRAINTS, GAO IS ACTUALLY REFERRING TO THE EMBASSYS RESPONSE TO A QUERY RE WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF THE US ""REFUSED TO YIELD"" TO THE RTG CONSTRAINTS. WE POINTED OUT THAT WE DID IN FACT RESIST THE 1972 CONSTRAINT ON STEVEDORING SERVICES UP TO THE POINT WHERE THE RTG ADVISED US ORALLY AND CONFIRMED IN WRITING THAT WE HAD NO CHOICE IN THE MATTER. THE RTG SPOKESMAN TOLD US AT THE TIME THAT THE RTG CONSIDERED THAT IT HAD THE SOVEREIGN RIGHT TO REQUIRE US TO DEAL ONLY WITH ETO FOR THESE SERVICES AND THAT THIS WAS THE ONLY WAY IT COULD ACCEPT RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE SECURITY OF US GOODS.\n8. THE SECURITY ARGUMENT HAS ALSO BEEN CITED BY THAI BASE COMMANDERS IN DENYING BASE ACCESS TO WOULD-BE CON- TRACTORS. WHILE WE FULLY RECOGNIZE THAT THERE MAY WELL HAVE BEEN OTHER CONSIDERATIONS IN PARTICULAR CASES AND THAT CONTRACTING WITH THAI GOVERNMENT ENTITIES OR INDIVIDUALS DOES NOT AUTOMATICALLY ENSURE IDEAL SECURITY, WE ARE NOT IN A POSITION TO REFUTE THE THAI ARGUMENT THAT PRIVATE BASE CONTRACT PERSONNEL HAVE IN A NUMBER OF INSTANCES ABUSED THEIR BASE ACCESS PRIVILEGE TO PILFER AND DIVERT DUTY-FREE GOODS TO THE BLACK MARKET. THAI OFFICIALS HAVE ALSO RAISED THE DANGER THAT SOME US ITEMS COULD BE DIVERTED IN THIS WAY TO INSURGENTS.\n9. WE THINK IT IS IMPRACTICAL TO CALCULATE WHETHER AND HOW MUCH THE US MIGHT HAVE PAID IN EXCESS COSTS AS A CON- SEQUENCE OF RTG CONSTRAINTS ON PROCUREMENT AND BASE ACCESS. ONE REASON IS THE DIFFICULTY OF FACTORING IN THE SECURITY ANGLE. ANOTHER IS THE DIFFICULTY OF CAL- CULATING THE COST AND POLITICAL CONSEQUENCES OF OUTRIGHT DEFIANCE OF RTG EDICTS. WE RECOGNIZE THE NEED TO OFFER THE FULLEST POSSIBLE EXPLANATION OF THE SITUATION TO CONGRESS, BUT MUST STRESS OUR VIEW THAT UNCLASSIFIED DISSEMINATION OF OUR FULL VIEWS ON THIS MATTER WOULD NOT ADVANCE HERE OUR EFFORTS TO NEGOTIATE THE BEST POSSIBLE TERMS FOR WHATEVER CONTINUED MILITARY PRESENCE MAY BE JOINTLY AGREED BY THE US AND THAILAND.\n0.

THE SEISMIC RESEARCH RECENTLY CONCLUDED INDICATES THAT THE MOST PROSPECTIVE LOCATION FOR THIS WELL IS IN A WATER DEPTH OF APPROXIMATELY 170 METERS WHICH REQUIRES ASPECIAL DEEP WATER DRILLING RIG.

SUMMARY:  ON THE WHOLE, OUTCOME FOR US OF 28TH GA WHICH RECESSED DECEMBER 18 WAS BETTER THAN WE HAD EXPECTED, CONFIDENTIAL  WITH SUPPORT OF OUR DIPLOMATIC MISSIONS CONTRIBUTING GREATLY TO SUCCESS IN SEVERAL CRITICAL SITUATIONS.  INITIA- TIVES IN SECRETARYS GA ADDRESS HAD POSITIVE IMPACT.  WE WERE ABLE TO ATTAIN OBJECTIVES ON SEVERAL IMPORTANT POLITICAL ITEMS, WHILE REMAINING IN SMALL MINORITY ON MOST AFRICAN AND ISRAELI RELATED ISSUES.  IN ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL AREAS US JOINED IN CONSENSUS WITH DEVELOPING COUNTRIES ON NUMBER OF IMPORTANT RESOLUTIONS IN CONTRAST WITH RELATIVE ISOLATION IN 1972.  WE ALSO MADE MODEST GAINS IN HUMAN RIGHTS AREA AND IN URGING FISCAL RESPONSIBILITY.  HOWEVER, GROWING AFRO-ARAB COHESION AND MILITANCY IN PURSUING OBJECTIVES OFTEN CONTRARY TO OUR INTERESTS WILL MAKE DEFENSE OF US POSITIONS AND ACHIEVEMENT OF OUR GOALS IN UN CONTEXT EVEN MORE DIFFICULT NEXT YEAR.  ACTION REQUESTED: REVIEW WITH HOST GOVERNMENT AS APPROPRIATE.  ALSO, EMBASSY COMMENTS APPRECIATED.  END SUMMARY.  \n2.  GENERAL ASSESSMENT:  WE ARE REASONABLY PLEASED WITH OVERALL GA RESULTS.  THERE WERE SOME SUCCESSES IN ALL FIELDS.  WHERE SETBACKS OCCURRED, THEY WERE CONTAINED. POLEMICS WERE KEPT WITHIN BOUNDS WITH FEW EXCEPTIONS, SUCH AS USSR ON MIDDLE EAST, AND PRC ON CAMBODIA AND AGAINST USSR ON DISARMAMENT.  OUR SATISFACTION, HOWEVER, IS TEMPERED BY REALIZATION THAT PROSPECTS FOR NEXT YEARS GA LESS THAN PROMISING.  \n3.  28TH GA DEMONSTRATED INCREASING TENDENCY OF LDCS TO PREOCCUPY UN WITH THEIR PRIORITIES AND TO GAIN UN ENDORSE- MENT OF POLITICAL POSITIONS ESTABLISHED IN NON-ALIGNED AND OAU FORUMS.  TO SOME EXTENT THIS STEMS FROM FRUSTRATION THAT IMPORTANT WORLD PROBLEMS ARE LARGELY DEALT WITH OUTSIDE UN.  IN MAIN, HOWEVER, MILITANT GROUP OF ""NON- ALIGNEDS"" ARE SEEKING TO CAPITALIZE ON THEIR PARLIAMENTARY VOTING POWER TO MAKE GA SERVE THEIR PURPOSES.  \n4.  US POSITION ON POLITICAL ISSUES WAS INCREASINGLY DEFENSIVE.  WE SOUGHT BY FINESSING CONFRONTATIONS AND REDUCING UN ROLE IN ISSUES OF IMPORTANCE TO REDUCE OUR VULNERABILITY IN DEBATE, E.G., ON KOREA.  OTHERWISE WE STROVE TO ANTICIPATE AND MANEUVER TO LIMIT THE DAMAGE, E.G., ON KHMER CREDENTIALS, MIDDLE EAST, AND DISARMAMENT. CONFIDENTIAL  ON ECONOMIC AND DEVELOPMENT ISSUES, WE NEGOTIATED RESO- LUTIONS THAT LEAVE BASIC DECISIONS TO GATT, IMF AND OTHER FORA WHERE ECONOMIC REALITIES RECEIVE GREATER WEIGHT.  \n5.  OUR TASK WAS COMPLICATED BY GROWING AFRO-ARAB MILITANT DOMINATION OF NON-ALIGNED MOVEMENT AND BY FREQUENT UN- WILLINGNESS OR INABILITY OF MODERATES TO RESIST PRESSURE FOR GROUP SOLIDARITY.  VOTES OR POSITIONS WERE OFTEN JUSTIFIED BY REFERENCES TO NON-ALIGNED CONFERENCE (NAC) RESES EVEN WHEN SUBJECTS HAD NOT BEEN FULLY DEBATED OR ENDORSED BY ALL PARTICIPANTS AND WERE FAR REMOVED FROM DIRECT INTEREST OF COUNTRIES CONCERNED (E.G., NAC RESES ON KOREA, CAMBODIA, PUERTO RICO).  \n6.  NONETHELESS OPPORTUNITIES REMAIN TO AVOID AUTOMATIC APPLICATION OF NON-ALIGNED VOTING MAJORITY BY SPLITTING OFF MODERATE NON-ALIGNED FROM MILITANTS THROUGH SUCH MEANS AS:  (A) ADOPTING POSITION ON ""MIDDLE GROUND"" OR WHICH OTHERWISE DEEMED EQUITABLE OR REASONABLE (E.G., DEFERMENT OF KHMER REPRESENTATION ITEM; UNEF FINANCING FORMULA); (B) WORKING WITH SELECTED AFRO-ASIAN REGIONALS (E.G., SE ASIAN EFFORTS IN KHMER CREDENTIALS) AND OTHERWISE CON- VINCING NON-ALIGNED THAT SPECIFIC PROPOSALS ARE IN THEIR OWN INTEREST (SUCCESSFULLY IN CASE OF CONVENTION ON PROTECTION OF DIPLOMATS); AND (C) ENCOURAGING RECOGNITION THAT SUCCESS OF DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM DEPENDS ON CONTINUING COOPERATION OF DONOR COUNTRIES.  AT SAME TIME, EXIGENCIES   OF US WORLD-WIDE INTERESTS AND COMMITMENTS USUALLY INHIBIT US FROM EFFECTIVE LOG-ROLLING.  MOREOVER OUR INCREASED IDENTIFICATION WITH ISRAEL AND PORTUGAL IN CONNECTION MIDDLE EAST WAR AND USE OF AZORES FURTHER REDUCED OUR ALREADY SLIM MARGIN OF MANEUVER WITH AFRICAN AND ARAB UN DELEGATIONS.  \n7.  WE MUST EXPECT THAT AT 29TH GA NON-ALIGNED MILITANTS, AWARE OF THEIR VOTING COHESION AND STRENGTH, IN CONTROL OF ASSEMBLY PROCEDURES, AND PROBABLY WITH ALGERIAN FOREIGN MINISTER BOUTEFLIKA IN THE PRESIDENCY, WILL PRESS EVEN MORE ENERGETICALLY ISSUES OF IMPORTANCE TO THEM SUCH AS COLONIALISM, RACE DISCRIMINATION, SOVEREIGNTY OVER NATURAL CONFIDENTIAL  RESOURCES, AND PREFERENTIAL TRADE AND DEVELOPMENT MEASURES. EVEN WHEN WE ARE SYMPATHETIC TO THEIR OBJECTIVES, WE MUST OPPOSE METHODS SUCH AS APPLICATION OF UNREALISTIC SANCTIONS OR USE OF UN AND ITS RESOURCES TO AID INSURGENT GROUPS.  \n8.  THUS, OVERALL PROBLEM FOR US THROUGH NEXT YEAR WILL BE HOW TO COPE WITH OUR NEAR-ISOLATION ON POLITICAL ISSUES OF OVERRIDING INTEREST TO A UNGA DOMINATED BY MILITANT AFRO- ARABS SUPPORTED NOT ONLY BY PRC AND SOVIET GROUP BUT ALSO ENJOYING SYMPATHY IN SOME CASES OF WEST EUROPEANS. AS THIS TREND CONTINUES, GA LIKELY TO BECOME EVEN LESS HOSPITABLE TO SERIOUS AND DISPASSIONATE CONSIDERATION OF POLITICAL POLICY.  \n9.  SITUATION REQUIRES US TO REVIEW AND IMPROVE OUR DAMAGE- LIMITING TECHNIQUES AND RE-EXAMINE OUR STYLE, WHICH IS FREQUENTLY IMPORTANT IN INFLUENCING GA RESULTS.  FURTHER, WE MUST ACTIVELY FOLLOW THROUGH ON INITIATIVES SUCH AS THOSE ANNOUNCED BY SECRETARY, NOTABLY ON PEACEKEEPING, FOOD SECURITY, DEVELOPMENT, AND SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY. FINALLY, WE SHOULD SEEK TO DEVELOP ADDITIONAL INITIATIVES IN SUCH FIELDS AS HUMAN RIGHTS AND DISARMAMENT, WHERE THERE ARE PROSPECTS FOR MOVES WHICH WOULD BE BOTH SUBSTAN- TIVELY AND COSMETICALLY USEFUL.  \n0.

SUMMARY. US INTERESTS WERE WELL SERVED BY MOST MAJOR DECISIONS TAKEN DURING 28TH GA. US ACHIEVED PRINCIPAL GOALS IT HAD SET FOR ITSELF, INCLUDING APPROVAL OF 1974 WORLD FOOD CONFERENCE, CONVENTION ON PROTECTION OF DIPLOMATS, AND WORKABLE SYSTEM FOR UNEF FINANCING. US ALSO DEFEATED OPPOSITION MOVES SERIOUSLY DETRIMENTAL TO ITS INTERESTS, SPECIFICALLY THOSE ON CAMBODIA AND KOREA. FACT THAT IN LATTER TWO INSTANCES, US WAS SATISFIED TO PREVENT UNACCEPTABLE GA ACTION UNDERLINES HOW MARGIN OF VICTORY FOR US ON MANY IMPORTANT ISSUES IN UN HAS BECOME INCREASINGLY THIN, AND IN SOME CASES HAS CEASED TO EXIST. OBSERVABLE TRENDS OVER PAST THREE MONTHS IN UN INCLUDE A) GROWING COHESION OF NON- CONFIDENTIAL  ALIGNED, MITIGATED TO SOME EXTENT BY CONCOMITANT GROWTH IN RESPONSIBLE BEHAVIOR; B) GROWING RELUCTANCE OF WEOS AND LAS TO RESIST NONALIGNED EVEN AT THEIR WORST; C) CONTINUED, PERHAPS SLIGHTLY DIMINISHED, WILLINGNESS OF SOVIET BLOC USE UN FORUMS TO ISOLATE AND DISCREDIT US; D) EXPANDED ACTIVITY OF CHINA IN WORK OF GA; E) IN- CREASING EMERGENCE OF EC-9 POSITIONS FREQUENTLY AT VARIANCE WITH USG STANCE. SECRETARY KISSINGERS EARLY APPEARANCE IN GA, US PROPOSAL FOR WORLD FOOD CONFERENCE, AND MOMENTUM OF US MIDDLE EAST DIPLOMACY ENABLED US TO MAINTAIN INITIATIVE DURING 28TH GA. HOWEVER ON BALANCE CURRENT TRENDS IN UN ARE RUNNING AGAINST US, RAISING STRONG POSSIBILITY THAT NEXT ASSEMBLY, UNDER PRESIDENCY OF ALGERIA, MAY BE LESS SUCCESSFUL FOR US THAN THIS ONE. END SUMMARY.\n2. GA ACCOMPLISHMENTS - THE 28TH GA ACCOMPLISHED ALL USG HAD REALISTICALLY HOPED, AND AVOIDED THAT WHICH IT HAD MOST SERIOUSLY APPREHENDED. PLANS FOR A WORLD FOOD CONFERENCE, PROPOSED BY SECRETARY KISSINGER IN HIS SEPTEMBER 24 SPEECH TO GA, WERE FIRST MET WITH INTENSE HOSTILITY BY NONALIGNED ON QUESTION OF TRADE ISSUES IN CONFERENCE. HARD NEGOTIA- TIONS IN ECOSOC AND FAO, HOWEVER, RESULTED IN MUTUALLY ACCEPTABLE TERMS, CLEARED WAY FOR GA RESOLUTION CO-SPONSORED BY MORE THAN 30 NONALIGNED CALLING FOR CONFERENCE TO BE HELD AS EARLY AS NOVEMBER 1974 IN ROME. NONALIGNED ALSO JOINTED IN 87- NATION SPONSORSHIP OF RESOLUTION TO HOLD SPECIAL SESSION OF GA IN SEPTEMBER 1975 JUST PRIOR TO REGULAR SESSION, FOR BROAD REVIEW OF DEVELOPMENT AND INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC COOPERATION, TO WHICH US ATTACHES CONSIDERABLE IMPORTANCE.\n0. GENERAL ASSEMBLY ADMITTED TWO GERMANIES, AND BY SO DOING ALLOWED US SCALE OF ASSESSMENT FOR UN BUDGET TO FALL TO 25 PERCENT, WITHOUT INCREASING THAT OF ANY OTHER MEMBER.\n3. NEGATIVE FACTORS -- THOSE ISSUES ON WHICH US WAS DEFEATED, OR ON WHICH ITS POSITION UNDERWENT SIGNIFICANT EROSION, WERE FOR THE MOST PART OF LESS IMMEDIATE CON- SEQUENCE TO PRIMARY US INTERESTS. NEVERTHELESS SOME ARE SIGNIFICANT, ESPECIALLY AS TRENDS LIKELY TO GAIN MOMENTUM IN FUTURE.\n4. THE NONALIGNED - GROWING COHESION AMONG NONALIGNED, PARTICULARLY ITS ARAB-AFRICAN CORE GROUP, HAS BEEN THEME OF SEVERAL MISSION REPORTS. NOTABLE ELEMENT IN NONALIGNED BEHAVIOR IS NOT WHAT THEY ARE SAYING BUT WHAT THEY ARE DOING ABOUT IT. THE PROGRAM OF 1973 ALGIERS NONALIGNED CONFERENCE DID NOT DIFFER GREATLY FROM THAT OF 1970 LUSAKA CONFERENCE. NOW HOWEVER, FOR FIRST TIME NONALIGNED HAVE ACHIEVED DEGREE OF COHERENCE IN PUTTING PROGRAM INTO EFFECT. THEY HAVE TENDED TO USE NEWLY REALIZED VOTING POWER RESPONSIBLY, TO THE EXTENT THAT RESPONSIBLE BEHAVIOR COULD BE SEEN TO ADVANCE THEIR INTERESTS. THUS IN ECONOMIC AREA AND MIDDLE EAST, US AND NONALIGNED DID AVOID UN- RESOLVABLE CONFRONTATIONS, AND OFTEN REACHED ACCEPTABLE AGREEMENTS. ON SOUTHERN AFRICAN RELATED ISSUES, HOWEVER, NONALIGNED SEE NO ACCEPTABLE MORE MODERATE WAY TO ADVANCE THEIR CAUSE, AND CONSEQUENTLY USED VOTING STRENGTH TO RACK UP HUGE MAJORITIES ON UNENFORCEABLE, ALTHOUGH PSYCHOLOGICALLY SATISFYING, RESOLUTIONS (E.G. GUINEA-BISSAU).\n5. CHINA - MAJOR PARADOX CHINA FACES IN UN POLICY IS HOW TO REAP BENEFITS OF GREAT POWER STATUS WITHOUT APPEARING TO CONFIDENTIAL  ACT LIKE ONE. IN GENERAL, CHINESE HAVE CONTINUED TO ALIGN THEMSELVES WITH MOST RADICAL ELEMENT OF NONALIGNED, AND HAVE BEEN WILLING TO ESCHEW CERTAIN GREAT POWER PREROGATIVES TO PROVE SINCERITY (E.G. CHINESE POSITION, AT THE OPENING OF THE LOS CONFERENCE, THAT PERMANENT SC MEMBERS DID NOT HAVE AUTOMATIC RIGHT TO COMMITTEE ASSIGNMENTS.) CHINA MAY ALSO NOT INSIST ON ITS POINT OF VIEW IF NONALIGNED PURSUE DIFFERENT COURSE. IN SUCH CASES, CHINA CONTINUED SELECTIVELY TO USE ""NON-PARTICI- PATION"" TACTIC. BUT IT SHOWED DETERMINATION TO PLAY A KEY ROLE ON OTHER QUESTIONS, TOOK AN INITIATIVE ON CHINESE AS A WORKING UN LANGUAGE, AND IN GENERAL GREATLY EXPANDED ITS ACTIVITIES DURING THE GA. SOVIETS REMAIN NUMBER ONE CHINESE TARGET HERE. WHILE CAREFULLY MAIN- TAINING EXCELLENT PERSONAL RELATIONS WITH US AND APPARENTLY NOT GOING OUT OF ITS WAY TO SEEK CONFRONTATION, CHINA IS QUITE WILLING, AS ON ISSUE OF CAMBODIA, TO ENGAGE IN SELECTIVE ANTI-US RHETORIC.\n6. NON-COMMUNIST ASIA - UNLIKE AFRICANS, LATINS, ARABS, EES AND WEOS, NO FORMAL EAST ASIAN CAUCUS OR REGIONAL GROUP HAS EVER EMERGED IN UN. THIS YEAR, HOWEVER, CAMBODIAN REPRESENTATION ISSUE GALVANIZED NON-COMUNIST EAST ASIAN STATES OF INDONESIA, THAILAND, PHILIPPINES, SINGAPORE, MALAYSIA, FIJI, LAOS, NEW ZEALAND, AUSTRALIA (TO MORE LIMITED EXTENT), AND PARTICULARLY JAPAN, TO COOPERATE IN PREVENTING GAS SEATING SIHANOUK. THIS EAST ASIAN COHESIAN SUGGESTS POSSIBILITY THAT NON-COMMUNIST EAST ASIANS, HAVING FOUND REST OF NONALIGNED UNRESPONSIVE TO THEIR CONCERNS, MAY MOVE TOWARD MORE COHERENT GROUPING IN UN, AND THAT JAPAN MAY SEEK LEADERSHIP ROLE IN THIS GROUP. THERE ARE MANY OBSTACLES, HOWEVER, INCLUDING ASIAN SUSPICIONS OF THE JAPANESE. SUCH A GROUP PRESUMABLY WOULD BE SUPPORTIVE OF US POSITIONS ON MOST ASIAN ISSUES, BUT ALSO LIKELY TO INFLUENCE JAPAN TOWARDS NONALIGNED POSITION ON OTHER MATTERS. JAPANS GROWING RELUCTANCE TO OPPOSE NONALIGNED ON MIDDLE EASTERN AND SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENTAL ISSUES WAS APPARENT DURING 28TH GA.\n7. SOVIET BEHAVIOR - SOVIETS AND THEIR EE ALLIES CONTINUED TO MAKE USE OF NONALIGNEDS FIXATION WITH RACIAL AND COLONIAL CONFIDENTIAL  ISSUES TO ISOLATE US AND TO KEEP PRESSURE OFF THEMSELVES IN HUMAN RIGHTS FIELD. SOVIETS WOULD IN ALL LIKELIHOOD HAVE PLAYED SIMILAR GAME WITH THE MIDDLE EAST, HAD NOT EVENTS OF OCTOBER CONVINCED THEM FOR MOMENT OF DANGER OF EXACERBATING A TENSE AND DELICATE SITUATION BY STIRRING UP THE GA. EVEN WHEN US AND USSR WORK IN COOPERATION, LATTER DOES SO WITH GREAT CAUTION TO PRESERVE ITS CREDENTIALS WITH THIRD WORLD. SOVIET PROPOSAL TO TRANSFER MONEY FROM MILITARY BUDGETS TO DEVELOPMENT ASSISTANCE (ROB) DEMONSTRATES EXTENT TO WHICH SOVIETS HAVE BEEN STUNG BY CHINESE ARGUMENT THAT SUPERPOWER DISARMAMENT NEGOTIATIONS HAVE BROUGHT NO BENEFIT TO THIRD WORLD.\n8.

WESTERN EUROPE - IN UN AS ELSEWHERE, EEC HAVE MANIFESTED GREAT DEGREE OF UNITY, OCCASIONALLY EX- PRESSING JOINT POSITION ON POLITICAL AS WELL AS ECONOMIC MATTERS THROUGH SINGLE DESIGNATED SPOKESMAN. FROM US VIEWPOINT, MOST NOTABLE DEVELOPMENT IN WESTERN EUROPEAN BEHAVIOR AND ONE AT LEAST PARTIALLY ATTRIBUTABLE TO MOVE TOWARDS UNITY, IS THEIR GROWING RELUCTANCE TO STAND UP AGAINST NONALIGNED. A MORE FLEXIBLE US POSITION ON SOUTHERN AFRICAN MATTERS WOULD PROBABLY HAVE GENERATED MORE EUROPEAN SUPPORT AND GREATER EUROPEAN EFFORTS TO CONFIDENTIAL  MODERATE NONALIGNED POSITION. HOWEVER, UNTIL EUROPE FEELS MORE SECURE IN ITS NEW IDENTITY, AND UNTIL ITS CAPACITY FOR POLITICAL COORDINATION TRANSCENDS THE SEARCH FOR THE LOWEST COMMON DENOMINATOR, EUROPE, IN UN AS ELSEWHERE, WILL SEEK TO DISTANCE ITSELF FROM US, AND WILL NOT BE ABLE TO AKE HARD DECISIONS NECESSARY TO RESIST MAJORITY (I.E. NONALIGNED) PRESSURES. AN UNRESOLVED QUESTION IS EXTENT TO WHICH UK, HAVING JOINED COMMUNITY AND US.\n9. CONCLUSION - THE 28TH GA CLOSES ON A RECORD OF SOLID ACHIEVEMENT, WHICH, WHEN ADDED TO THE UNS HANDLING OF THE MIDDLE EAST CRISIS, HAS LED TO RENEWAL OF OPTIMISM CON- CERNING UNS POTENTIAL AMONG MANY MEMBER DELEGATIONS, AS WELL AS GENERAL PUBLIC. AT SAME TIME, GROWING COHESION OF NONALIGNED MAJORITY IN UN, AND GROWING AWARENESS OF THEIR ABILITY TO USE ORGANIZATION FOR OWN PURPOSES, IS CAUSE FOR CONCERN. IF ONE COULD ACCURATELY PREDICT FUTURE AS STRAIGHT LINE PROJECTION OF CURRENT TRENDS, THERE WOULD BE GOOD REASON TO FORESEE EARLY EMERGENCE OF A UN DOMINATED BY NONALIGNED, UNRESPONSIVE TO US INFLUENCE, OPPOSED TO US POLICY ON MOST ISSUES, AND BY REASON OF THIS CONFLICT, REDUCED TO IMPOTENCE. OF ALL UN MEMBERS, HOWEVER, NONALIGNED AS A GROUP HAVE LEAST INTEREST IN SEEING UN SYSTEM WEAKENED OR DESTROYED. NONALIGNED WILL USE THEIR VOTING POWER TO PUSH US SOMEWHAT FASTER THAN IT IS INCLINED TO GO ON ISSUES OF INTEREST TO THEM, BUT WILL NOT NORMALLY SEEK CONFRONTATION UNLESS THEY BECOME CONVINCED THAT COMPROMISE WILL GAIN THEM NOTHING, AS THEY ALREADY BEHAVE WITH REGARD TO SOUTHERN AFRICAN ISSUES. THE US CAN AND SHOULD USE VARIOUS TACTICS TO DETER NONALIGNED FROM REDUCING UN TO A MERE SOUNDING BOARD, DIVORCED FROM POWER REALITIES AND HINDERING RATHER THAN HELPING DEVELOPMENT OF A VIALBE STRUCTURE OF INTER- NATIONAL LAW. THIS CAN ULTIMATELY BE DONE ONLY IF NONALIGNED CONVINCED THEY HAVE MORE TO GAIN FROM AN EFFECTIVE UN, SUPPORTED BY THE US, THAN FROM A WEAK ONE, IN CONFLICT WITH IT.\n",682048

              COVERED IN THIS MESSAGE AND REFTELS KISSINGERNOTE BY OCT: POUCHED BANJUL AND TAIPEI,frus1969-76ve14p1d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n2.  THE CENTER OF GRAVITY OF NONALIGNED BLOCK HAS OVER  PAST DECADE SHIFTED TO ITS ARAB-AFRICAN CORE, LEAVING MUCH  OF THE MOVEMENTS ORIGINAL LEADERSHIP ( INDIA, INDONESIA,  EVEN YUGOSLAVIA) ON THE FRINGES.  PRESENT NONALIGNED SOLI- DARITY APPEARS TO BE BASED ON SHARED INTEREST IN ECONOMIC  DEVELOPMENT, PLUS AN IMPLICIT TRADE OFF BETWEEN THE ARABS  AND THE AFRICANS OF SUPPORT IN THEIR RESPECTIVE CAMPAIGNS  AGAINST WHAT THEY SEE AS RESIDUAL WESTERN ENCLAVES IN THEIR  AREAS OF THE WORLD, I. E. ISRAEL AND THE WHITE REGIMES OF  SOUTHERN AFRICA.  INCREASED IN COHESION AMONG NONALIGNED MAY  RESULT FROM FRUSTRATION WITH STATUS QUO, INABILITY TO FIND  SUPPORT ELSEWHERE, AND PERHAPS A GROWING SOPHISTICATION  AMONG NONALIGNED MEMBERS, AS WEAK NEW STATES BECOME AWARE  OF THE LIMITS OF UNILATERAL OR EVEN REGIONAL ACTION, AND  THE NEED TO ATTRACT THE MOST WIDESPREAD SUPPORT POSSIBLE.\n3.  MOST SPECTACULAR EXHIBITION OF NONALIGNED SOLIDARITY TO DATE HAS BEEN RUPTURE OF RELATIONS WITH ISRAEL BY \n4.  PERHAPS MOST ALARMING IN TERMS OF FUTURE OF UN AS AN  INSTITUTION IS NONALIGNED CHALLENGE TO THE AUTHORITY OF  THE ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON ADMINISTRATIVE AND BUDGETARY  QUESTIONS,  AND CONSEQUENTLY TO THE ABILITY OF THE MAJOR  CONTRIBUTORS TO MAINTAIN SOME DEGREE OF CONTROL OVER UN  PROGRAMS AND BUDGET.  IN MOST  INSTANCES NONALIGNED VOTING STRENGTH ONLY GIVES POWER TO  BLOCK UN ACTION, OR TO PASS ESSENTIALLY MEANINGLESS RESOLU- TIONS.  ON PROGRAM AND BUDGETARY MATTERS, HOWEVER NON ALIGNED  ACTION CAN AND DOES RESULT IN GA DECISION WHICH ARE BINDING  ON ALL MEMBERS.  THUS IRRESPONSIBLE MANIPULATION OF  UN BUDGET BY NONALIGNED COULD  QUICKLY CREATE SITUATION IN WHICH ONLY US OPTIONS WOULD BE  TO PAY AS DIRECTED, OR WITHHOLD CONTRIBUTION IN VIOLATION  OF OBLIGATIONS UNDER UN CHARTER.   MISSION HAS REPORTED  NONALIGNED EFFORT TO DISCREDIT ACABQ, AND TO INCREASE APP- ROPRIATIONS FOR AREAS OF INTEREST TO THEM.  AMOUNTS INVOLVED ARE STILL RELATIVELY SMALL, BUT CONTINUED SYSTEMATIC OVERRIDING  OF ACABQ WILL REMOVE LAST BARRIER TO EVENTUAL CONFRON- TATION BETWEEN UN MAJORITY AND ITS MAJOR CONTRIBUTORS. (TEN MEMBER STATES CONTRIBUTE 77 PERCENT OF UN BUDGET.)\n5.  NONALIGNED POSITION ON THE UN BUDGET, PROTECTION OF  DIPLOMATS, LAW OF THE SEA, AND NUMEROUS OTHER QUESTIONS ARE  CLEARLY RELATED TO THEIR PRIORITY CONCERNS WITH ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT, AND ""LIBERATION"" OF SOUTHERN AFRICA AND ISRAELI OCCUPIED TERRITORY.  MORE DIFFICULT TO UNDERSTAND HAS BEEN  THE NONALIGNED POSITIONS ON SUCH PERIPHERAL QUESTIONS AS KOREA, CAMBODIA, AND VIETNAM, PARTULARLY IN VIEW OF THE  FACT THAT THE MEMBERS OF THE MOVEMENT CLOSEST TO THE  CONFIDENTIAL  SCENE ARE IN GENERAL THE LEST DESIROUS OF CONCERTED NON- ALIGNED ACTION.  NONALIGNED POSIION ON THESE QUESTIONS SEEMS  TO COMBINATION OF EMOTIONAL RESPONSE TO SITUATION THEY SEE AS ANALOGOUS TO THEIR OWN PROBLEMS  AND A PRACTICAL DESIRE  TO EXCHANGE THEIR VOTES ON ISSUES NOT OF ESSENTIAL INTEREST  TO THEM FOR COMMUNIST SUPPORT ON ITEMS OF REAL CONCERN. \n6.  AFRICAN GROUP, COMPRISING ALMOST ONE-THIRD OF UN MEMBERSHIP,  DOMINATE THE NONALIGNED NUMERICALLY.  DURING THIS GA SESSION,  ALLIANCE OF AFRICANS AND ARABS HAS BECOME MORE SOLID; ARAB DELEGATES ARE GOING OUT OF WAY TO SUPPORT FULLY AFRICAN  POSITIONS ON SOUTHERN AFRICAN QUESTIONS, IN RETURN FOR ALMOST  TOTAL AFRICAN SUPPORT FOR ARAB CAUSE IN MIDDLE EAST.  AFRICANS AND  ARABS, IN TURN, ARE MAKING STRONG EFFORTS TO WIN INCREASING  SUPPORT FROM ASIANS AND LATIN AMERICANS, ESPECIALLY THOSE  WHO PARTICIPATED IN NONALIGNED CONFERENCE.  THEY SEEM TO  BE ENJOYING INITIAL SUCCESS. \n7.  AN IMPORTANT FACTOR IN THE DEVELOPING SOLIDARITY THIS  GA SESSION WAS OBVIOUSLY THE NONALIGNED CONFERENCE AT  ALGIERS, HELD JUST PRIOR TO GA OPENING AND CLEARLY  DESIGNED TO PROMOTE JUST THIS KIND OF UNITY AT UN.  ON A  VARIETY OF ISSUES THAT HAVE ARISEN, WE ARE INCREASINGLY AWARE OF IMPORTANCE OF ""RESOLUTIONS"" ADOPTED AT ALGIERS. ON KOREAN ISSUE, FOR EXAMPLE, WE RAN INTO GREAT RELUCTANCE, \n8.  THERE ARE STILL CENTRIFUGAL FORCES AT WORK, EVEN AMONG  AFRICANS THEMSELVES, AND FISSURES STILL APPEAR EVEN ON  AFRICAN ISSUES.  RECENT EXAMPLE WAS OPEN SPLIT AMONG  AFRICAN GROUP IN FOURTH COMMITTEE VOTE ON PROTUGUESE TERRITORIES RESOLUTIONS.  BASIS OF SPLIT SEEMED TO BE  CONFIDENTIAL  EFFORT OF SOME NONALIGNED, LED BY TANZANIA, TO COME  UP WITH TEXT THAT WOULD ATTRACT EVEN WIDER SUPPORT, PARTICULARLY AMONG EUROPENS.  THE MAVERICK LIBYAN DELE- GATION RESISTED, HOWEVER, AND INTRODUCED AN AMENDMENT IN  EFFECT OPENLY SANCTIONING USE OF FORCE BY LIBERATION ORGAN- IZATIONS.  THIS PRECIPITATED OPEN FIGHT ON FLOOR AMONG AFRICANS, NO LESS BITTER FOR FACT THAT ALL AFRICAN SPEAKERS  DEPLORED SHOW OF DISUNITY.  COHESION OF NONALIGNED IS NOT  YET FULLY TESTED ON ISSUES WHICH MAY INVOLVE DIVERGENT NATIONAL INTERESTS OF INDIVIDUAL NONALIGNED STATES.  A TEST IN THE  UN CONTEXT MAY COME LATER ON ISSUES LIKE LAW OF THE SEA.  THE MOST WE CAN SAY AT PRESENT IS THAT RELEEX FOR UNITY IS  STRONG AND PEER PRESSURE IS HIGHLY PERSUASIVE. \n9.  ALGERIAN DELEGATION IS DRIBE TO ASSERT LEADERSHIP OVER  NONALIGNED AND FOLLOWING LEAD OF BOUMEDIENE AT ALGIERS NAC,  IS ACTIVE PROMOTING UNITY AND IS ADEPT AT USING VARIETY OF  PRESSURES.  AGTERIANS NOT WITHOUT RIVALS.  HOWEVER, NEXT  YEAR FONMIN BOUTEFLIKA WILL BE PRESIDENT OF 29 TH UNGA PLACING  ALGERIAN IN AN EVEN STRONGER POSITION OT EXERCISE LEADERSHIP ROLE.  SOME AFRICANS HAVE COMPLAINED ABOUT ALGERIAN STRONG- ARM TACTICS IN RAMMING THROUGH RESOLUTIONS AT NAC,  AND ABOUT  DIFFICULTIES THEY EXPERIENCED EVEN REGISTERING THEIR ""RESER- VATIONS"" TO CERTAIN RESOLUTIONS WITH ALGERIAN FOREIGN  MINISTRY.  FRIENDLY ASIAN DELEGATIONS HAVE NOTED PRIVATELY  THEIR FORMAL RESERVATIONS AT ALGIERS NAC MEETING ON ASIAN ISSUES SUCH AS SUPPORT OF BRUNK, PRG, ETC.  SINGAPORE IN  FACT REPORTEDLY PUT A GENERAL RESERVATION ON THE RECORD AT  ALGIERS.  NATURAL DIFFIDENCE AND UNWILLINGGNESS TO OPPOSE NUMERICALLY OVERWHELMING AFRO-ARAB BLOCK HAVE MEANT THAT  ASIAN OBJECTIONS HERE TO NAC-SPONSORED RESOLUTIONS HAVE  BEEN PRESENTED IN COMPARATIVELY LOW-KEY FASHION THEREBY  AVOIDING, SO FAR, HEAD-ON CONFRONTATION,  IT REMAINS TO  BE SEEN WHETHER THE MORE MODERATE AMONG THE NON- ALIGNED WILL CONTINUE TO FOLLOW HARD-LINE, ALGERIAN-STYLE  LEADERSHIP.  \n0.  NONALIGNED STATES CLEARLY SENSE POWER THEY CAN WIELD,  AND NOW THERE IS A DISTURBING TENDENCY TO SUE THIS POWER  ON INCREASING NUMBER OF ISSUES.  MOST TRRIKING RECENT  DEVELOPMENT WAS INTRODUCTION BY AFRICAN GROUP IN SIXTH  CONFIDENTIAL  COMMITTEE OF A PARTICULARLY MISCHIEVOUS AMENDMENT  TO CONVENTION ON PROTECTION OF DIPLOMATS.  AFRICAN AMENDMENT WOULD EXEMPT NATIONAL LIBERATION MOVEMENTS FROM PROVISIONS OF  CONVENTION; THIS WOULD IN EFFECT SABOTAGE ENTIRE EFFORT.  (FOR EXAMPLE, KHARTOUM MURDERS WOULD NOT BE COVERED BY  SUCH A CONVENTION)  DANGER OF THIS TREND IS THAT NONALINGED  MAY COME TO LOOK AT ALL ISSUES,  EVEN MOST UNCONTENTIOUS,  SOLELY IN THE LIGHT OF HOW THEY MAY EFFECT  PROGRESS TOWARDS CENTRAL NONALIGNED GOALS. \n1.  SO FAR, NONALIGNED UNITY HAS WORKED TO BENEFIT OF  SOVIET BLOC, SINCE SOVIETS ARE IN POSITION TO SUPPORT  AFRICANS ON AFRICAN ISSUES AND ARABS ON MIDDLE EASTERN  ONES AND OFTER GO AT IT WITH STOMACH-TURNING OBSEQUIOUSNESS IT IS BY NO MEANS INEVITABLE THAT SOVIETS WILL ALWAYS BENEFIT.  ON ISSUES LIKE PROTECTION OF DIPLOMATS AND DEVELOPMENT THE US AND USSR MAY WELL FIND THEMSELVES  TOGETHER IN SMALL MINORITY.  CHINA, ON OTHER HAND, IS  IN A POSITION TO GAIN MOST MILEAGE FORM INCREASED  COHESION  AND POWER OF NON-ALIGNED.  SOME NON-ALIGNED  STATES TEND TO REGARD CHINA AS ONE OF THEM,  AND CHINESE  DELEGATION HERE HAS CAREFULLY NURTURED AND EXPLOITED THIS ADVANTAGE.  UNFORTUNATELY THOSE NATIONS WHO HAVE THE MOST REASON  TO BE CAUTIOUS OF CHINESE INFLUENCE AND THE MOST EXPERIENCE  IN DEALING WITH IT ARE JUST THOSE WHOSE INFLUENCE WITHIN  THE NON-ALIGNED IS ON THE WANE.  \n1.  VARIOUS AFRICAN DELEGATIONS, FRIENDLY TO US, HAVE  TOLD US THAT NON-ALIGNED GROUP IS WATCHING US VOTES ON  AFRICAN ISSUES VERY CAREFULLY.  (SEE SEPTEL FOR AFRICAN REACTIONS TO OUR VOTES OF PORTUGUESE TERRITORIES.)   GHANAIAN  AMB TOLD US FRANKLY THAT AFRICANS ARE ENGAGED IN ""VOTE  TRADING.""   (USUN 4575)  THIS PROBABLY FORESHADOWS AN  INCREASED TENDENCY TO VOTE AGAINST US, SOLELY AS RESPONSE  TO OUR NEGATIVE VOTES ON SOUTHERN AFRICAN OR OTHER ISSUES OF INTEREST TO THE NON-ALIGNED.\n2.  COMMENT:  ON EACH OF THE ISSUES OF CENTRAL CONCERN  TO THE NON-ALIGNED (DEVELOPMENT, THE MIDDLE EAST, AND  SOUTHERN AFRICA), THE US IS SEEN AS A PRINCIPAL OBSTACLE  TO US ACTION OF THE SORT THEY SUPPORT.  IF THE US IS NOT  CONFIDENTIAL  TO BE FURTHER ISOLATED WITIN THE UN AND IF THE UN IS  NOT EVENTUALLY TO BE DESTROYED AS AN INSTITUTION FOR CONSTRUCTIVE  INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION, THERE WILL HAVE TO BE SUFFICIENT PROGRESS ON THESE ITEMS TO CONVINCE THE MORE REASONABLE  NON-ALIGNED THAT THE GRADUALIST APPROACH URGED BY THE US  HAS SOME CHANCE OF MEETING THEIR ASPIRATIONS.  AT THE  SAME TIME THE US MUST MAKE CLEAR THAT WE CAN ONLY BE PUSHED  SO FAR, AND THAT WE WILL CONTINUE TO USE SUCH INSTRUMENTS  AS THE VETO AND THE POWER OF THE PURSE TO BLOCK  IRRESPONSIBLE AND HARMFUL UN ACTION, REGARDLESS OF THE  NUMERICAL MAJORITY BEHIND IT.

FINAL OUTCOME OF KHMER QUESTION WAS NARROW COTE (53 YES,\n2. LAS WERE ALSO HELPFUL IN DEBATES AND IN BEHIND-THE-SCENES. BOLIVIA (DE ZAVALA), PARAGUAY (BARREIRO), URUGUAY (GIAMBRUNO) AND BARBADOS (WALDRON-RAMSEY) SPOKE STRONGLY AGAINST PRO-SIHANOUK RESOLUTION, BARBADOS BEING PARTICULARLY OUTSPOKEN IN TAKING ON THE NON-ALIGNED. HAITI, VENEZUELA, NICARAGUA AND COSTA RICA WERE ALSO INSCRIBED TO SPEAK, BUT DID NOT DO SO SINCE DEBATE WAS CUT OFF BY LIBERIAN MOTION TO DEFER QUESTION. (WE AND ALLIES TOOK CARE TO INFORM THEM OF THIS MANEUVER IN ADVANCE AND THEY WERE AGREEABLE TO IT.) URUGUAY (GIAMBRUNO) WAS ONE OF TWO SPEAKERS CHOSEN TO SECOND LIBERIAN MOTION. EARLIER, WHEN IT APPEARED THAT WRITTEN RESOLUTION FOR DEFERMENT MIGHT BE REQUIRED INSTEAD OF SIMPLE MOTION FROM FLOOR, BARBADOS, BOLIVIA, COLOMBIA, COSTA RICA, DOMINICAN REPUBLIC, GUATEMALA, HAITI, HONDUREAS, PARAGUAY AND URUGUAY (IN ADDITION TO LESOTHO AND LIBERIA) AGREED TO COSPONSOR. COLOMBIA AS WELL AS SEVERAL OTHERS MENTIONED ABOVE WERE ACTIVE IN LOBBYING AMONG LATIN AMERICAN GROUP.\n3. LA VOTE ON DEFERMENT REPRESENTED SOME IMPROVEMENT OVER ANTICIPATED VOTE ON PRO-SIHANOUK RESOLUTION, ALTHOUGH NOT QUITE AS MUCH AS HOPED. ALL THOSE VOTING YES ON DEFERMENT WERE PREPARED TO VOTE AGAINST SUBSTANTIVE RESOLUTION, EXCEPT FOR MEXICO (ABSTANTION) AND POSSIBLY PANAMA (UNCOMMITTED, POSSIBLE ABSTENTION). IN ADDITION TO CUBA (A COSPONSOR), GUYANA AND PERU HAD INSTRUCTIONS TO VOTE FOR RES AND TRINIDAD/TOBAGO SEEMED IN- CLINED TO DO SO, WHILE JAMAICA WAS UNDECIDED AND ARGENTINA HAD INSTRUCTIONS TO ABSTAIN. ONE ABVIOUS FACTOR WAS THAT ALL SIX LAS WHO FAILED TO VOTE FOR DEFEREMENT ARE MEMBERS OF NON-ALGINED GROUP. WE KNOW OF SOME (INCLUDING JAMAICA) THAT WERE UNDER HEAVY PRE- SSURE FROM NON-ALIGNED ANC CHINESE, WHO PLAYED UP DEFERMENT AS PARTISAN MOVE RATHER THAN COMPROMISE. IT SEEMS THAT JAMAICA (WHO CONFIDENTIAL TOLD US AS MUCH) AND PERU SOLVED DILEMMA BETWEEN THIS AND APPEALS FROM EAST ASIANS AND OTHERS BY ABSENTING THEMSELVES. PERUVIANS ARE EXPLAINING THAT THEIR ABSENCE WAS MERE ERROR, WHILE ALSO SAYING THEY HAD NOT VOTING INSTRUCTIONS ON DEFERMENT.\n4. OVERWHELMING LA OPPOSITION TO PRO-SIHANOUK RES AND SUPPORT FOR DEFERMENT WERE PRINCIPALLY BASED ON SINCERE, DEEP CONVICTION THAT UN HAD NO BUSINESS INTERVENING IN INTERNAL AFFAIRS OF A MEMBER STATE BY DECIDING WHO SHOULD GOVERN IT AND BY SANCTIFYING A GOVERNMENT IN EXILE. THEY DEPLORED THIS ATTEMPTED BREACH OF CHARTER AND THE PRECEDENT IT WOULD SET. THIS DOES NOT GAINSAY EFFECTIVENESS OF LOBBYING BY CAMBODIANS, JAPANESE AND OTHER EAST ASIANS, FOR WHOM THERE WAS GENUINE SYMPATHY AS THE GROUP MOST INTIMATELY CONCERNED, AS WELL AS EFFECTIVENESS OF FONMIN LONG BORETS LA TOUR LATE LAST YEAR. IN ADDITION, LAS RESENTED EFFORT BY NON-ALIGNED GROUP TO OVERWHELM OTHERS BY INVOKING ALGIERS CONFERENCE ""SOLIDARITY"" AND THEREBY ACHIEVE BLOCK VOTING -- A FACOTR OF IN- CREASING CONCERN TO MODERATE LAS IN OVERALL UN CONTEXT. DEPTH OF FEELING OVER KHMER ISSUE WAS DEMONSTRATED BY SPONTAN- EOUS BURST OF APPLAUSE FROM LAS AND OTHER FRIENDLY DELEGATIONS WHEN VOTE COUNT FLASHED ON BOARD.\n5. LASTLY, WE WISH TO NOTE THAT, WHILE LOBBYING AND TACTICS WERE PRIMARY RESPONSIBILITY OF EAST ASIANS, LAS WERE WELL AWARE OF INTENSE US INTEREST, AND OUR FRIENDS WERE HAPPY TO COOPERATE CLOSELY WITH US AS WE PLAYED INCREASINGLY OPEN ROLE HERE IN FINAL STAGES. GIVEN THE POLITICAL IMPORTANCE OF ISSUE, THIS IS INDEED GRATIFYING IN THE LIGHT OF OUR OVERALL RELATION- SHIPS WITH LATIN AMERICA.\n6. ACTION SUGGESTED: SUPPLEMENTING SUGGESTIONS TO CERTAIN POSTS CONTAINED REF A AND TO ARA CONTAINED REF B, POSTS IN 19 COUNTRIES VOTING YES MAY WISH TO EXPRESS APPRECIATION TO HOST GOVERNMENTS FOR THEIR KEY SUPPORT OF MOTION FOR DEFERMENT, DRAW- ING ON FOREGOING AS APPROPRIATE, ESPECIALLY PARA 2. IN DOING SO, WE ALSO SUGGEST POSTS BEAR IN MIND THAT OUR POSITION HERE WAS ONE OF FULL SUPPORT TO WHAT WAS PRIMARILY AN EFFORT BY EAST ASIAN GROUP, I.E., KHMER REPUBLIC JAPAN, FIJI, PHILIPPINES, THAILAND, MALAYSIA, SINGAPORE, INDONESIA AND NEW ZEALAND. AS SUGGESTED BY DEPARTMENT IN REF A, POSTS MIGHT STRESS THAT DEFEREMENT SPARED CONFIDENTIAL UN AND ITS MEMBERSHIP A POTENTIALLY DAMAGING PRECEDENT AND PROVIDED COMMON-SENSE SOLUTION WHICH KEEPS DOOR OPEN FOR POLITICAL RECONCILIATION OF CAMBODIAN FACTIONS.\n7.

END SUMMARY.  \n2.  DISCUSSION WITH THE PRESIDENT DECEMBER 4:  THE PRESIDENT NOTED HOW MANY CHANGES THERE HAD BEEN SINCE HE AND PRESIDENT CEAUSESCU BEGAN DEALING WITH EACH OTHER IN 1967 AND 1969.  CEAUSESCU AGREED, RECALLED HOW ROMANIA HAD WELCOMED THE NORMALIZATION OF RELATIONS WITH CHINA AND THE  AGREEMENTS WITH THE SOVIET UNION.  HE STATED, HOWEVER, THAT WHILE THE US, CHINA AND USSR, AS BIG POWERS, HAD AN IMPORTANT ROLE TO PLAY, OTHER STATES LIKE ROMANIA MUST NOT BE IGNORED.  HE HOPED THAT THE IMPROVEMENT OF RELATIONS BETWEEN THE US AND THE USSR ON THE ONE HAND AND THE US AND CHINA ON THE OTHER WOULD BE CARRIED OUT IN SUCH A WAY AS TO RESPECT THE RIGHTS OF OTHER STATES.  HE SAID THESE WERE SENTIMENTS WHICH HE DID NOT HIDE FROM EITHER THE CHINESE OR THE SOVIETS.  THE PRESIDENT COMMENTED THAT NEITHER HIS VISIT TO CHINA NOR HIS MEETINGS WITH THE SOVIET LEADER HAD MET WITH UNIVERSAL APPROVAL, BUT THAT SO FAR AS SMALLER STATES WERE CONCERNED, A DEFINITE EFFORT HAD BEEN MADE TO INCLUDE LANGUAGE IN THE COMMUNIQUES OR AGREEMENTS CONCLUDED WITH THE SOVIETS AND THE CHINESE RESPECTING AND PROTECTING THE RIGHTS OF ALL NATIONS FROM BEING JEOPARDIZED BY SUCH AGREEMENTS.  HE ASSURED PRESIDENT CEAUSESCU THAT HE STANDS ABSOLUTELY FIRM FOR ROMANIAN INDEPENDENCE AND SOVEREIGNTY AND THAT SO FAR AS THE UNITED STATES IS CONCERNED, NO COUNTRY NEED HAVE ANY FEAR THAT WE WILL USE OUR POWER TO DOMINATE OTHER COUNTRIES OR INFRINGE ON THEIR INDEPEN- DENCE -- THIS BEING THE CORNERSTONE OF AMERICAN FOREIGN POLICY.

THE PRESIDENT POINTED OUT THE NEED FOR GOOD RELATIONS BETWEEN THE UNITED STATES AND THE SOVIET UNION, BUT INDICATED THAT NEITHER HE NOR SECRETARY-GENERAL BREZHNEV HAD ANY ILLUSIONS AS TO THE FACT THAT OUR INTERESTS COLLIDE IN VARIOUS PARTS OF THE WORLD.  WHAT HAS TO BE DONE IS TO SEE THAT THESE COLLISIONS DO NOT RESULT IN AN EXPLOSION.  THE PRESIDENT STRESSED HIS BELIEF THAT WE HAVE ESTABLISHED AT LEAST A BEGINNING OF A STRUCTURE WHERE DIFFERENCES CAN BE SETTLED PEACEFULLY.  \n4.  CEAUSESCU EXPRESSED HIS GREAT SATISFACTION WITH WHAT THE PRESIDENT HAD SAID,  REITERATED HIS UNDERSTANDING OF THE ROLE OF BIG POWERS, BUT CAME BACK AGAIN TO THE   NEED FOR BIG POWERS TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE INTERESTS OF OTHER COUNTRIES LEST MISCALCULATIONS BE MADE OF THOSE COUNTRIES INTERESTS.  \n5.  AT MEETING OF DECEMBER 5, THE FOLLOWING TOPICS WERE COVERED:     A.  MFN - CEAUSESCU EXPRESSED THE HOPE THAT AN INTERIM SOLUTION COULD BE FOUND FOR GIVING ROMANIA MFN PENDING ADOPTION OF GENERAL LEGISLATION.  THE PRESIDENT INDICATED THAT MFN POSED A VERY DIFFICULT POLITICAL PROBLEM, BUT HE ASSURED CEAUSESCU THAT THE US WOULD WORK VERY CLOSELY WITH ROMANIA TO FIND A SOLUTION.  HE ALSO MENTIONED THAT WE WOULD ENCOURAGE AMERICAN BUSINESS TO TAKE FAVORABLE ATTITUDES TOWARD ROMANIA.     B.  CSCE AND MBFR - CEAUSESCU ASKED THAT THE US AT GENEVA ENCOURAGE MEASURES OF MILITARY DISENGAGEMENT AND ALSO THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A PERMANENT BODY.  ON MBFR, HE EXPRESSED THE OPINION THAT THINGS WERE NOT GOING THAT WELL BECAUSE NOT ALL OF CENTRAL EUROPE IS BEING  DIS- CUSSED AND BECAUSE THE REDUCTIONS BEING CONSIDERED ARE ONLY SYMBOLIC.  THE PRESIDENT COMMENTED THAT DISCUSSIONS ON MBFR ARE GOING TO BE DIFFICULT BUT THAT WE WILL BEAR IN MIND THE CONCERN FOR COUNTRIES LIKE ROMANIA.  SIMILARLY, WITH CSCE WE ARE SENSITIVE TO THE INTERESTS OF ROMANIA AND OTHER COUNTRIES WHICH HAVE SUPPORTED THE CONFERENCE BUT IT IS CLEAR AT THIS STATE THERE IS CONSIDERABLE DIFFERENCE OF OPINION AS TO HOW THE CONFERENCE SHOULD    SECRET  EVENTUALLY COME OUT.  THE PRESIDENT ASKED THE SECRETARY TO SEE THAT THE CLOSEST CONSULTATIONS TAKE PLACE WITH ROMANIA ON BOTH SUBJECTS.     C.  MIDDLE EAST - CEAUSESCU URGED THAT PROVISION BE MADE FOR PALESTINIAN REPRESENTATION AT THE PEACE CONFER- ENCE.  THE SECRETARY COMMENTED THAT SUCH PARTICIPATION AT THE BEGINNING, IN THE OPINION OF ALL THE PARTICIPANTS, RAISED TOO MANY PROBLEMS, BUT THE QUESTION COULD BE DISCUSSED DURING THE FIRST PHASE.  HE ADDED THAT FROM OUR VIEWPOINT SUCH PARTICIPATION IS NOT EXCLUDED. CEAUSESCU ALSO RAISED THE DESIRABILITY OF OTHER STATES ASIDE FROM THE US AND THE SOVIET UNION TAKING PLACE IN THE CONFERENCE.  AMONG SUCH STATES MIGHT BE ROMANIA.  HE ARGUED THAT WHILE THE MAIN THING WAS, OF COURSE, TO REACH RESULTS DURING THE CONFERENCE, NONETHELESS, PARTI- CIPATION OF OTHER COUNTRIES MIGHT KEEP ALL THE BLAME, IF THINGS DIDNT GO WELL, FROM BEING PUT ON THE SOVIET UNION AND THE UNITED STATES.  THE PRESIDENT COMMENTED THAT PARTICIPATION OF OTHER COUNTRIES WAS NOT A CLOSED QUESTION. HE NOTED, HOWEVER, THAT SO FAR AS WESTERN EUROPEAN COUNTRIES WERE CONCERNED, THEY HAVE TAKEN A PAROCHIAL   VIEW AND HAVE NOT BEEN HELPFUL, HAVING THOUGHT MORE ABOUT THE FRUITS OF THE CONFERENCE THAN ABOUT ITS RESPON- SIBILITIES.  THE SECRETARY POINTED OUT THAT EVEN AMONG EASTERN EUROPEAN COUNTRIES ROMANIA HAD BEEN THE ONLY ONE TO HAVE MAINTAINED RELATIONS OVER THE YEARS WITH BOTH PARTIES TO THE CONFLICT.  \n6.  DISCUSSIONS AT LUNCH DECEMBER 4 WITH SECRETARY, SHULTZ, AND HUMPHREY CENTERED ON MFN.  SENATOR HUMPHREY THOUGHT IT MADE SENSE STILL TO TRY TO HAVE A GENERAL BILL BUT THERE WAS ""OUTSIDE POSSIBILITY"" OF SEPARATE BILL FOR ROMANIA AND ""WE WILL HAVE TO LOOK INTO IT.""  SECRETARY SHULTZ SUGGESTED THAT ""EQUALITY IN TRADE"" WOULD BE BETTER TITLE THAN MFN.  CEAUSESCU RAISED THE QUESTION OF LOW INTEREST LONG-TERM CREDITS AND SECRETARY SHULTZ DEFLECTED HIM TOWARD EX-IM AND IBRD PROVIDING NO PROMISE OF CON- CESSIONARY RATES.  CEAUSESCU RETURNED TO THE ISSUE INDICATING THAT HE WAS THINKING IN TERMS OF 500-600 MILLION DOLLARS WHICH WOULD BE USED FOR PURCHASES IN THE    SECRET  US.    RUSH\n",682292

PERMANENT BODY ON MBFR HE EXPRESSED                            THE OPINION THAT THINGS WERE NOT GOING THAT WELL BECAUSE NOT ALL OF                            CENTRAL EUROPE IS BEING DISCUSSED AND BECAUSE THE REDUCTIONS BEING                            CONSIDERED ARE ONLY SYMBOLIC THE PRESIDENT COMMENTED THAT DISCUSSIONS                            ON MBFR ARE GOING TO BE DIFFICULT BUT THAT WE

THAT FROM OUR VIEWPOINT SUCH                            PARTICIPATION IS NOT EXCLUDED CEAUSESCU ALSO RAISED THE DESIRABILITY OF                            OTHER STATES ASIDE FROM THE US AND THE SOVIET

                THE CONFERENCE THAT ABOUT ITS RESPONSIBILITIES THE SECRETARY POINTED                            OUT THAT EVEN AMONG EASTERN EUROPEAN COUNTRIES ROMANIA HAD BEEN THE ONLY

THE BEGINNING IN THE OPINION OF ALL THE                            PARTICIPANTS RAISED TOO MANY PROBLEMS BUT THE QUESTION COULD BE                            DISCUSSED DURING THE FIRST PHASE HE ADDED THAT FROM OUR VIEWPOINT SUCH                            PARTICIPATION IS NOT EXCLUDED CEAUSESCU ALSO RAISED THE DESIRABILITY OF                            OTHER STATES ASIDE FROM THE US AND THE SOVIET

CONVERSATION COVERED JOINT VENTURES, CREDITS AND EXPORT PROMOTION.\n3.  JOINT VENTURES.  SECRETARIES SHULTZ AND DENT SPOKE IN FAVOR OF VIABLE JOINT VENTURES, NOTED THAT DECISIONS TO ENGAGE IN THEM WERE MADE BY PRIVATE INDUSTRY AND THAT THE JOINT COUNCILS SET UP BY THE CHAMBER OF COMMERCE SHOULD PROVE FACILITATIVE JUST AS  PRESIDENT NIXON HAD INDICATED THE GOVERNMENT WOULD BE.  CEAUSESCU RAISED THE QUESTION OF DUTY FREE ENTRY INTO THE UNITED STATES OF PRODUCTS OF JOINT VENTURES, NOTING THAT THE FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF GERMANY AND ROMANIA HAD AGREEMENTS TO TAKE THE ENTIRE OUTPUT DUTY FREE.

DENT SAID AN ADDITIONAL 5 INCREASE HAD BEEN GRANTED ROMANIA THIS YEAR ON A ONE-SHOT BASIS.\n6.  ROMANIAN EXPORTS.  CEAUSESCU SUGGESTED A LISTING OF GOODS ROMANIA MIGHT EXPORT TO US IN ORDER TO EXPEDITE PROMOTION OF SUCH EXPORTS AND BETTER COVER ROMANIAN TRADE IMBALANCE AND MEET ITS IMPORT NEEDS.  DENT RECOGNIZED MUTUAL BENEFIT OF TWO-WAY TRADE AND SUGGESTED PRIVATE US MARKETING GROUP OR ROMANIAN EXPERTS SHOULD SEEK TO BUILD MARKET FOR BROAD ARRAY OF PRODUCTS TO MAKE ROMANIAN EXPORT SITUATION MORE STABLE.
