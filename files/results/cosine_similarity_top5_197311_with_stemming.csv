this would help tremendously Most of our conversation was taken with the                        Kings impressions of the Middle East and of the motivations of the Arab                        leadersThere were three categories of leaders: those who wanted peace and had the                        courage to say so among whom he included Morocco Tunisia Jordan Egypt                        and Syria those who wanted peace but could only follow others Saudi                        Arabia Kuwait and Algeria and those for whom peace is a difficult problem                        for domestic reasons Iraq and IsraelThe Palestinians the King said were the joker in the deck This issue was                        an aphrodisiac for the Arabs no one would dare do anything against the                        Palestinians The King thought the Palestinians were interested in contact                        with the US and that if the US could win the confidence of the                        Palestinians then no Arab nation would fail to followThe King believed that Egypt and Syria were both firmly resisting Soviet                        influence The Syrians he said had withstood two years of Soviet pressure to sign a friendship                        treaty The US problem was to make up for time we had lost and to present                        some evidence of US goodwill The gap between the US and these countries                        was wide but it was a sentimental gap not an ideological gapIt was the Kings judgment that the problem would be solved with Israel when                        it had leaders who belonged to the new generation The new generation on                        both sides could talk to each other the elders were the obstacleI told the King that we needed about one month to organize our strategy in                        the US and prepare our domestic situation We needed a strategy first                        before coming up with any specific plan Then we would move decisively I                        hoped we could begin the negotiation process in December and begin to show                        progress in JanuaryIn the meantime we needed from the Arabs some patience and some willingness                        not to make us waste our energies in epic struggles over trivia The oil                        boycott I also pointed out worked against Arab interests because it would                        arouse public opinion in America against the Arabs The King said he would                        use his influence in this senseKissinger met again with Hassan on                            November 6 According to a memorandum of conversation Kissinger insisted that we must                            settle the Middle East crisis but not under Russian pressure If there                            is Russian pressure we will switch back to Israel because we must                            demonstrate that the Soviet Union can not settle the problem There is                            no pressure from the Soviet Union now For a week we tried not to do                            anything If the Soviet Union would have stayed out we would have                            stayed out When the Soviet Union began sending arms then it was no                            longer an Arab versus

SPEAKING BOTH FOR HIMSELF AND SYRIAN PRESIDENT ASSAD IN BAGHDAD, ARAFAT ASKED BAKR AND SADDAM HUSSEIN RETURN IRAQI TROOPS TO SYRIA. THEY DEMURRED, STATING ONLY THAT TROOPS WOULD BE SENT BACK IF AND WHEN FIGHTING RESUMES. BAKR AND SADDAM ASKED ARAFAT WHETHER FEDAYEEN WOULD PARTICIPATE IN ME PEACE CONFERENCE, TO WHICH WDARAFAT REPLIED THERE NO OTHER ALTERNATIVE AS LONG AS ARAB SITUATION REMAINS AS IS. TO REMAIN ALOOF, HE SAID, WOULD LEAVE FILED TO KING HUSSEIN TO DO AS HE PLEASE WITH PALESTINIAN QUESTION. IRAQIS REPLIED THAT ONLY PROPER COURSE WOULD BE FOR FEDAYEEN TO COME TO IRAQ AND CARRY ON STRUGGLE AGAINST ISRAEL FROM THERE. ARAFAT SAID THIS WOULD CAUSE FEDAYEEN TO BECOME POLITICAL REFUGEES, AND NOTED THAT IRAQIS SCARELY ALLOWED HIS BODYGUARDS CARRY ARMS. IRAQIS ASKED FEDAYEEN COORDINATE WITH GOI IN OPERATIONS AGAINST JORDAN, AND\n2.  IN MEETING WITH KING FEISAL, KING QUERIED ARAFAT RE FEDAYEEN RELATIONSHIP WITH SOVS. ARAFAT DESCRIBED RELATIONS IN DETAIL, NOTING THEY ""GOOD, HONEST AND HONORABLE"". HE WAS SURPRISED BY FEISALS COMMENT THAT THANKS AND APPRECIATION ARE DUE USSR FOR ITS ATTITUDE TOWARD ARABS.  KING THEN REPROACHED FEDAYEEN FOR NOT HAVING FOUGHT ENOUGH IN OCTOBER WAR.ARAFAT CALIMED FEDAYEEN HAD DONE DOUBLE WHAT WAS DEMANDED OF THEM, CITING (BOGUS) STATISTICS FROM POL COMMUNIQUES RE FEDAYEEN OPERATIONS AGAINST ISRAEL. ARAFAT ALSO TOLD FEISAL THAT CHINESE HAD DELIVERED MORE ARMS AND AMMUNITION TO FEDAYEEN IN RECOG- NITION OF THEIR EFFORTS. ASKED ABOUT HIS TALKS WITH KISSINGER, FEISAL TOLD ARAFAT THAT KISSINGER HAS ASKED HIM LIFT OIL EMBARGO AGAINST US, BUT THAT HE HAD REPLIED THIS WOULD DEPEND ""ON MANY THINGS."" FEISAL QUOTED HIMSELF AS TELLING SECRETARY, ""I CAN NO LONGER DEFEND YOU (AMERICANS) VIS-A-VIS MY OWN FAMILY AND PEOPLE, MUCH LESS ARABS AT LARGE. WE WANT ISRAELI WITH- DRAWAL AND ASSURANCES THAT RIGHTS OF ALESTINIAN PEOPLE WILL BE PROTECTED"". WHEN KISSINGER ASKED FEISAL WHAT HE MEANT BY RIGHTS OF PALESTINIAN PEOPLE, FEISAL REPLIED, ""I MEAN PALESTINE.\n4.  IN CAIRO, ARAFAT FIRST DISCUSSED MILITARY SITUATION WITH SADAT. TENOR OF THIS DISCUSSION LED ARAFAT TO CONCLUDE THAT ""WAR IS NOT OVER"". SINCE HE BELIEVES NEITHER EGYPT NOR SYRIA CAN OR WILL ENDURE PRESENT SITUATION FOR LONG. (ACCORDING TO MATAR, MOST EGYPTIANS ANTICIPATE ANOTHER ""SURPRISE"" FROM SADAT--PROBABLY ANOTHER ROUND OF FIGHTING, BECAUSE SADAT DOES NOT WISH GENEVA PEACE CONFERENCE TO BEGIN IN MID-DECEMBER WITH ISRAELI FORCES STILL ON CANALS WEST BANK.) SHIFTING TO PEACE CONFERENCE, ARAFAT INFORMED SADAT THAT PLO WOULD AGREE TO PARTICIPATE ON CONDITION JORDANIAN QUESTION ""IS SETTLED"". ARAFAT SAID HE HAS GOTTEN IMPRESSION FROM KING DEISAL THAT KING HAD ALREADY MADE UP HIS MIND ON THIS SUBJECT (IN FEDAYEEN FAVOR). SADAT TOLD ARAFAT HE HAD DISCUSSED WITH KISSINGER PROBLEM ODYJORDAN AND QUESTION OF WHO REPRESENTS PALESTINIAN PEOPLE. ACCORDING TO SADAT, KISSINGER INTERUPTED TO SAY,""BUT WE HAVE GOOD RELATIONS WITH JORDAN"". SADAT THEN ASKED WHAT US POSITION WOULD BE IF THERE WERE UNANIMOUS ARAB AGREEMENT THAT PLO IS LEGITIMATE REPRE- SENTIATIVE OFTFPALESTINIAN PEOPLE, TO WHICH KISSINGER REPLIED, ""IN THAT CASE, SITUATION WOULD BE DIFFERENT"" SADAT ALSO URGED KISSINGER EXERT GREATER EFFORTS WITH SYRIA AND PLO, SINCE HE SAID EGYPT WOULD NOT ATTNED PEACE TALKS WITHOUTTHEM.\n5.  COMMENT: ARAFATS RENDITION OF HIS TALKS WITH FEISAL AND SADAT MAY ERR ON ROSY SIDE, SINCE WE UNDERSTAND FROM OTHER SOURCES HERE THAT BOTH LEADERS WERE CAREFUL TO INFORM HIM THAT THERE ARE LIMITS TO THEIR ABILITY TO GAIN FEDAYEEN ADMITTANCE TO PEACE TALKS.

                   conflictHe expressed his deep appreciation that you were showing such consideration                        towards Morocco by sending me to Rabat first Under present circumstances                        this was an unforgettable gesture He expressed great personal admiration                        for you He pledged that his small country would do all could to facilitate

this would help tremendously Most of our conversation was taken with the                        Kings impressions of the Middle East and of the motivations of the Arab                        leadersThere were three categories of leaders: those who wanted peace and had the                        courage to say so among whom he included Morocco Tunisia Jordan Egypt                        and Syria those who wanted peace but could only follow others Saudi                        Arabia Kuwait and Algeria and those for whom peace is a difficult problem                        for domestic reasons Iraq and IsraelThe Palestinians the King said were the joker in the deck This issue was                        an aphrodisiac for the Arabs no one would dare do anything against the                        Palestinians The King thought the Palestinians were interested in contact                        with the US and that if the US could win the confidence of the                        Palestinians then no Arab nation would fail to followThe King believed that Egypt and Syria were both firmly resisting Soviet                        influence The Syrians he said had withstood two years of Soviet pressure to sign a friendship                        treaty The US problem was to make up for time we had lost and to present                        some evidence of US goodwill The gap between the US and these countries                        was wide but it was a sentimental gap not an ideological gapIt was the Kings judgment that the problem would be solved with Israel when

VAN ELSLANDE AND BEIGIAN POLICY IS BASED ON THREE PRINCI- PLES:   -- TO CONTRIBUTE TO PEACE BY ADOPTING AN ""EQUITABLE"" ATTITUDE TOWARD THE PARTIES TO THE CONFLICT.   -- TO FAVOR EUROPEAN ""CONCERTATION"", BECAUSE ONLY A UNITED EUROPE CAN TAKE A REAL PART IN THE RESTORATION OF PEACE.   -- TO PARTICIPATE IN INTERNATIONAL GUARANTEES AND IN THE PROGRAM OF ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT IN THE REGION.\n4. VAN ELSLANDE SAID THAT SC RESOLUTION 242 RETAINS ITS VALIDITY AS THE BASIS FOR A LASTING SOLUTION OF THE PALESTINIAN PROBLEM. HE CLARIFIED BELGIUMS POSITION ON THE WORDING OF THE RESOLUTION IN REGARD TO ISRAELI WITHDRAWAL FROM THE OCCUPIED TERRITORIES, BY SAYING ISRAEL SHOULD MAKE A COMPLETE WITHDRAWAL, ""WITH THE EXCEPTION OF SUCH MINOR ADJUSTMENTS AS MAY BE AGREED ON IN THE COURSE OF NEGOTIATIONS."" WITHDRAWAL, HOWEVER, CANNOT BE A PRECONDITION FOR NEGOTIATIONS.\n5. VAN ELSLANDE STRESSED THAT A MIDDLE EAST SOLUTION MUST INCLUDE INTERNATIONAL GUARANTEES TO ASSURE ISRAELS SECURITY. UNCLASSIFIED  EUROPEANS SEE THESE GUARANTEES AS COMING UNDER SECURITY COUNCIL AUSPICIES, WITH UN TROOPS STATIONED IN DEMILITARIZED ZONES AND NOT SUBJECT TO UNILATERAL ORDER FROM EITHER SIDE TO WITHDRAW.\n6.  REVIEWING BELGIAN INITIATIVES AND ACTIONS DURING THE MIDDLE EAST WAR, VAN ELSLANDE SAID BELGIUM ""HALTED ITS ARMS EXPORTS TO THE REGIONA DN HAS WATCHED OVER (VIELLE) A STRICT APPLICATION OF THIS RULE BOTH WITH REGARD TO BELGIAN EXPORTATION AND TRANSIT ACROSS BELGIUM."" THIS DECISION, HE ADDED, ""IS SUBJECT TO REVIEW OR PROGRESSIVE ADJUSTMENT IN RELATIONS TO THE EVOLUTION OF THE SITUATION AND PROGRESS ON THE PATH TO PEACE.""\n7. HE CHIDED THE SOVIET UNION AND EASTERN EUROPEAN COUNTIRES FOR BLOCKING A EUROPEAN PARTICIPATION IN UNEF, NOTING MOSCOWS ""RETICENT ATTITUDE"" TOWARDS A TRULY EUROPEAN INITIATIVE EVEN THOUGH IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A ""EUROPEAN"" AND NOT A NATO PROJECT.\n8. ALTHOUGH THE US AND THE USSR HAVE A PARTICULAR ROLE TO PLAY BASED ON THEIR POWER AND THEIR EARLIER COMMITMENTS IN THE REGION, ""IT IS INDESPENSABLE THAT OTHER COUNTRIES TAKE PART IN THE SEARCH FOR PEACE, BECAUSE NO TWO COUNTRIES HOWEVER POWERFUL CAN SUBSTITUTE FOR THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY AND EXPECT TO DECIDE (THE ISSUE OF) PEACE OR WAR"".\n9. VAN ELSLANDE THEN OFFERED AN EMPHATIC DEFENSE OF THE EC-9 DECLARATION OF NOVEMBER 6, ADMITTEDLY NOW OVERTAKEN BY SUCH NEW DEVELOPMZNTS AS THE EGYPTIAN/ISRAELI ""AGREEMENT OF KILOMETER\n0. STRESSING THE INDISPENSABILITY OF UN SECURITY COUNCIL BACKING OF PEACE ARRANGEMENTS, VAN ELSLANDE SAID UNSC IS ONLY ORGANIZATION CAPABLE OF ENGAGING INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY BEHIND OBLIGATIONS. ""THERE MUST BE A LINK, THEREFORE, BETWEEN THIS NEGOTIATION AND THE UN; THIS DOES NOT EXCLUDE THE AUSPICES OF THE SUPER-POWERS, SO LONG AS THAT DOES NOT EXCLUDE THE REST OF THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY AND, PARTICULARLY, EUROPE"".\n1. ""WE HAD OCCASION TO MAKE THIS POINT TO MR. SISCO WHEN HE VISITED BELGIUM. WE HOPE HE UNDERSTOOD THAT GIVEN THE POSITIVE ROLE THAT EUROPE WANTS TO PLAY, IS NOT APPROPIRATE TO KEEP UNCLASSIFIED  EUROPE AWAY FROM THE DIFFERENT PHASES OF THE NEGOTIATION ABOUT TO BEGIN.""\n2. VAN ELSLANDE THEN SAID THE PALESTINIAN PROBLEM WAS CENTRAL TO THE MIDDLE EAST CONFLICT AND THAT THOUGHT HAD TO BE GIVEN TO THE NATURE OF THE RIGHTS OF THE PALESTINIANS, THEIR REPRESENTATION AT THE PEACE TALKS, AND THE GEOGRAPHIC AREA IN WHICH THEIR RIGHTS MUST BE EXERCISED. ""WE SEE NO CONTRADICTION BETWEEN RECOGNITION OF THE RIGHT OF THE PALESTINIANS AND GUARANTEEING THE INDEPENDENCE AND VIABILITY OF ISRAEL.""\n3. REGARDING THE IRRAELI INTERPRETATION OF THE EC-9 DECLARATION, ""WE REFUSE TO ENTER INTO POLEMICS WITH ISRAEL AHD HOPE TO PURSUE A TRUE DIALOGUE WITH THAT STATE IN THE SEARCH FOR PEACE.""\n4. ""WE HAVE UNDERTAKEN A DIPLOMATIC ACTION WITH THE ARABS TO DEMONSTRATE TO THEM THAT A TRUE COOPERATION WITH EUROPE IMPLIES THAT THEY RECOGNIZE OUR UNITY AS WE RESPECT THEIRS.""\n5. REFERRING TO THE INDISPENSIBILITY OF COOPERATION BETWEEN EUROPE AND THE US ON THE MIDDLE EAST AND UNDER SECRETARY SISCOS VISIT OF NOVEMBER 13, VAN ELSLANDE SAID ""WITHOUT WISHING TO RAKE OVER THE PAST, I TOLD HIM WE REGRETTED BEING SO LITTLE INFORMED ABOUT THE INTENSTIONS AND GOALS OF AMERICAN POLICY... AND WE AGRED THAT A ""CONCERTATION"" WAS IN THE INTEREST OF BOTH PARTIES.""\n6. COMMENT. BELGIAN POSITION ON WITHDRAWAL REMAINS UNCHANGED SINCE 1971 BUT VIGOROUS AFFIRMATION IS NEW. BELGIAN PRESS COVERAGE OF THE FOREIGN MINISTERS PRESENTATION HAS RANGED EVENLY OVER SEVERAL THEMES:   -- PRESENTATION TLITS IN PRO-ARAB DIRECTION AS EXEMPLFIED BY FOREIGN MINISTERS EMPHASIS ON BELGIAN ACCEPTANCE OF INTERPRETATION THAT ISRALE SHOULD WITHDRAW FROM ""THE"" ACCOPIED ARAB TERRITORIES:   -- DECLARATION WAS DELIVERED TO A PARTICULARLY THIN HOUSE WITH FEWER THAN THRITY DEPUTIES PRESENT OUT OF 212:\n",1113232

CEASEFIRE:  ISRAELI TROOPS DISMANTLED UN ROADBLOCK OUTSIDE TOWN OF SUEZ NOVEMBER 12 AFTER CONFRONTATION WITH UNEF CONTINGENT WHICH HAD BEEN ORDERED BY UNEF COMMANDER    SECRET  SIILASVUO TO TAKE OVER TWO CHECKPOINTS ON CAIRO-SUEZ ROAD IN ACCORD WITH PARA 5 OF NOVEMBER 11 AGREEMENT.  UNEF ESTABLISHED ITS CHECKPOINTS AT KILOMETER 101 AND KILOMETER\n2.  ISRAELIS THREATENED TO USE FORCE TO REMOVE LATTER CHECKPOINT AND ASKED FINNISH CONTINGENT TO WITHDRAW.  WHEN FINNS STOOD FIRM ISRAELIS MOVED INTO AREA AND OVERTURNED UN FLAG AND TENT AND STARTED LOADING UN EQUIPMENT INTO THEIR TRUCKS.  FINNISH CONTINGENT REMAINED ON SITE.  UNEF COMMANDER STRONGLY PROTESTED THIS INCIDENT TO ISRAELI GOVERNMENT THROUGH UNTSO JERUSALEM. DISAGREEMENT SEEMS TO CENTER ON TERMS UNDER WHICH ISRAELIS WOULD HAND OVER CHECKPOINTS.  IDF SPOKESMAN SAID THAT UNEF   ESTABLISHMENT OF ROADBLOCK ON WESTERN APPROACH TO TOWN OF SUEZ CUTS OFF IDF CHECKPOINT FROM ISRAELI FORCES WEST OF SUEZ.  SOME PRESS SOURCES REPORTED THAT EGYPTIANS WERE DEMANDING THAT ISRAEL GIVE UP MILITARY CONTROL OF CAIRO/ SUEZ ROAD, ALTHOUGH THERE WAS NO MENTION OF QUOTE CONTROL UNQUOTE IN NOVEMBER 11 AGREEMENT AND ISRAELIS WOULD NOT CONCEDE TO THIS DEMAND.   RADIO JERUSALEM REPORTED TWO EGYPTIAN CEASEFIRE VIOLATIONS NOVEMBER 12.  ACCORDING TO THIS REPORT, EGYPTIANS BROKE CEASEFIRE BY OPENING LIGHT WEAPONS FIRE EAST OF 60TH KILOMETER ON SUEZ CANAL AND FIRING ON ISRAELI FORCES SOUTHEAST OF LAKE TIMSAH.  THERE ARE NO REPORTS OF ANY CEASEFIRE VIOLATIONS ON SYRIAN FRONT.  AS FOR LEBANON/ISRAELI BORDER, RECENT ISRAELI SHELLINGS OF SHABA IN SOUTH LEBANON ESTIMATED BY USDAO BEIRUT TO BE TRIGGERED BY PRESENCE OF RADICAL DIEHARD PALESTINIAN COMMANDOS HOLED UP IN VICINITY WHO OCCASIONALLY HARASS ISRAELI POSITIONS ON MOUNT HERMON.  \n2.  POWS:  EGYPTIAN MILITARY SPOKESMAN, GENERAL MUKHTAR, STATED NOVEMBER 12 THAT EGYPT HAS HANDED OVER TO ICRC LIST OF NAMES OF ISRAELI POWS.  LIST INCLUDES 110 PRISONERS, OF WHICH 45 WOUNDED.  MUKHTAR ADDED THAT REMAINING LISTS OF PRISONER NAMES WILL BE GIVEN TO ICRC WITHIN FEW DAYS AND THAT FIRST ISRAELI WOUNDED PRISONER ALREADY HANDED OVER TO ISRAELIS.      SECRET  3.  UNEF:  WITH EXCEPTION OF CHINA WHICH DISASSOCIATED ITSELF FROM DECISION, UNSC ON NOVEMBER 12 CONSENTED TO APPOINTMENT OF MAJOR GENERAL ENSIO SIILASVUO AS COMMANDER OF UNEF AND COLONEL R. W. BUNWORTH AS CHIEF OF UNTSO. ALSO, UNSYG WALDHEIM ANNOUNCED HE HAD ASKED KENYA AND SENEGAL TO PROVIDE CONTINGENTS FOR UNEF.  SENEGAL HAS ALREADY SUGGESTED IT WILL PROVIDE A BATTALION, BUT KENYA EARLIER WAS REPORTED TO HAVE DECLINED TO PARTICIPATE IN UNEF.  ACCORDING TO WALDHEIM SITUATION ON THE GROUND IS AS FOLLOWS:  SWEDES ARE NOW IN POSITION SOUTH OF ISMAILIA; FINNS ARE IN AND AROUND SUEZ CITY; AUSTRIANS WEST OF BITTER LAKES; AND IRISH NEAR RABAH, EAST OF CANAL. ADVANCE CONTINGENTS OF POLES AND CANADIANS ARE ALSO IN MIDDLE EAST SURVEYING SCENE IN TERMS OF THEIR UNEF SUPPORT RESPONSIBILITIES.   USUN REPORTS CANADIANS ARE TAKING A VERY STIFF ATTITUDE IN THEIR DISCUSSIONS WITH UN OFFICIALS ON THE DIVISION OF THEIR WORK WITH POLES ON ESTABLISHING CANADIAN/POLISH LOGISTICS UNIT; POLES, ON OTHER HAND, ARE PROVING QUOTE DANGEROUSLY COOPERATIVE UNQUOTE, ACCORDING TO SENIOR UN OFFICIAL, IN THE DIVISION OF RESPONSIBILITIES AND HAD COMPLAINED FROM CAIRO THAT CANADIANS ARE TRYING TO DO EVERYTHING.  DIFFICULTY APPEARS TO BE CANADIAN RESENTMENT AT HAVING TO SHARE THE SUPPORT FUNCTION, THEREBY RENDERING USELESS THEIR CAREFULLY REFINED PLANS FOR DEPLOYING, IN SUPPORT OF UN OPERATIONS, A FULLY INTEGRATED SUPPORT BATTALION CAPABLE, INDEED, OF DOING IT ALL.  WE HAVE ALREADY URGED CANADIAN PERMREP TO DO WHAT HE CAN TO HELP GET OVER THIS HURDLE.   STILL ANOTHER SOURCE OF AFRICANS FOR UNEF TURNED UP TODAY IN AN ANNOUNCEMENT FROM KINSHASA THAT GOVERNMENT OF ZAIRE AGREED TO REQUEST BY UNSYG FOR A BATTALION OF SOME 600 ZAIRIAN TROOPS FOR UNEF.  THIS HAS NOT YET BEEN CONFIRMED IN NEW YORK.   IN ANOTHER DEVELOPMENT, UNSYG SENT TELEGRAM TO UN DELEGA- TIONS      NOVEMBER 12 APPEALING FOR ADVANCE PAYMENT FOR UNEF SINCE UN DOES NOT HAVE CASH RESOURCES ON HAND O PAY INITIAL COST.    SECRET  4.  GUYER TRIP TO ME:  UNSYG DECIDED TO SEND ONE OF HIS TOP AIDES TO ME.  ACCORDING TO PRESS REPORTS, UNDER SECRETARY GENERAL ROBERTO GUYER WILL VISIT CAIRO, JERUSALEM AND DAMASCUS.  ALTHOUGH TRIP DESCRIBED BY UN SPOKESMEN AS ROUTINE, PRESS SPECULATES IT IS LINKED TO ISRAELI POW ISSUE AND ISRAELI FONMIN ABBA EBANS RECENT REMARKS IN NEW YORK WHEN HE CALLED FOR QUOTE MORE VIGOROUS INTERNATIONAL ACTION UNQUOTE BY UNSYG AND OTHERS TO OBTAIN RELEASE OF ISRAELI POWS IN SYRIA.  GUYER TO DEPART NOVEMBER 12 FOR GENEVA TO TALK WITH ICRC REPS AFTER WHICH HE WILL GO TO DAMASCUS TO MEET WITH SYRIAN OFFICIALS.  \n5.

WHAT THE BATTLE BOILS DOWN TO IS WHO WILL HAVE EFFECTIVE MILITARY CONTROL OVER THE SUPPLY CORRIDOR GOING TO THE EGYPTIAN THIRD ARMY.  ISRAEL CLAIMS THAT THE SIX POINT AGREEMENT SIGNED WITH EGYPT DOES NOT OBLIGE IT TO RELINQUISH CONTROL OVER THE CORRIDOR.  EGYPT AND AP- PARENTLY THE UN BELIEVE IT DOES.

FOLLOWING IS FULL TEXT OF AIDE MEMOIRE GIVEN AMBASSADOR BY FONMIN SHEN CHANG-HUAN NOVEMBER 7, 1973. AS DELIVERED TO US, AIDE MEMOIRE BEARS NO ROC CLASSIFICATION. HOWEVER, WE ARE CLASSIFYING IT CONFIDENTIAL. COMMENT BY SEPTEL.\n2. BEGIN TEXT: AS ANNOUNCED BY THE UNITED STATES GOVERN- MENT, SECRETARY OF STATE DR. HENRY KISSINGER WILL AGAIN VISIT THE CHINESE MAINLAND ON NOVEMBER 10-13, 1973.\n3. THE GOVERNMENT OF THE REPUBLIC OF CHINA CANNOT BUT FEEL DEEPLY CONCERNED OVER THIS VISIT OF DR. KISSINGER AS OVER HIS PREVIOUS ONES AND THEIR CUMULATIVE IMPACT. IT IS NOTED THAT DR. KISSINGER WILL NOW MAKE THE TRIP TO THE CHINESE MAINLAND FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HIS CAPACITY AS THE SECRETARY OF STATE OF THE UNITED STATES.\n4. THE BASIC VIEWS OF THE GOVERNMENT OF THE REPUBLIC OF CONFIDENTIAL CHINA CONCERNING THE INCREASING CONTACTS BEING SOUGHT BY THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT WITH THE CHINESE COMMUNIST REGIME HAVE BEEN REPEATEDLY MADE KNOWN IN THE STATEMENT ISSUED BY VICE-PRESIDENT C.K. YEN, THEN CONCURRENTLY PREMIER, ON JULY 16, 1971, AND IN THE STATEMENTS ISSUED BY THE MINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS ON FEBRUARY 17 AND 28,\n3.\n5. IN CONNECTION WITH DR. KISSINGERS PENDING VISIT TO THE CHINESE MAINLAND, THE ATTENTION OF THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT IS INVITED TO THE FOLLOWING VIEWS OF THE GOVERN- MENT OF THE REPUBLIC OF CHINA.\n6. (1) THE MEASURES TAKEN SO FAR BY THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT FOR THE PURPOSE OF DEVELOPING ITS CONTACTS WITH THE CHINESE COMMUNIST REGIME HAVE CAUSED GREAT HARM TO THE INTERNATIONAL POSITION OF THE GOVERNMENT OF THE REPUBLIC OF CHINA. SHOULD THE UNITED STATES GO STILL FURTHER IN THE PROMOTION OF ITS RELATIONS WITH THE CHINESE COMMUNIST REGIME, IT IS INEVITABLE THAT SUCH ACTION WOULD IN THE END BRING IRREPARABLE DAMAGE TO THE REPUBLIC OF CHINA AS REGARDS ITS INTERNATIONAL POSITION.\n7. (2) THE PROMOTION OF A FULL-FLEDGED RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE UNITED STATES AND THE CHINESE COMMUNIST REGIME WOULD NOT ONLY ENCOURAGE THAT REGIME TO BECOME IN- CREASINGLY ADVENTUROUS, BUT ALSO PROMPT THE FREE NATIONS THAT HAVE NOT DONE SO TO SEEK TO ESTABLISH DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS WITH THAT REGIME AT THE EXPENSE OF THEIR EXISTING DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS WITH THE REPUBLIC OF CHINA. SUCH EVENTUALITIES WOULD NATURALLY HAVE THE EFFECT OF CAUSING THE REPUBLIC OF CHINA TO BE PROGRESSIVELY ISOLATED IN THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY. AT THE SAME TIME, THEY WOULD UNAVOIDABLY PRODUCE DISASTROUS CONSEQUENCES UPON THE WHOLE OF THE ASIAN AND PACIFIC REGION, PARTICULARLY UPON SOUTH- EAST ASIA, IN WHICH THE INTERESTS OF THE UNITED STATES ARE ALSO INVOLVED.\n8. (3) IT WILL BE RECALLED THAT THE UNITED STATES GOVERN- MENT HAS GIVEN TO THE GOVERNMENT OF THE REPUBLIC OF CHINA REPEATED ASSURANCES AND HAS ALSO MADE PUBLIC STATEMENTS TO THE EFFECT THAT THE UNITED STATES WILL NEVER ABANDON ITS ALLIES CONFIDENTIAL NOR SACRIFICE THE INTERESTS OF ITS OLD FRIENDS. IT IS HOPED THAT, CONSISTENT WITH THIS AVOWED POSITION, THE UNITED STATES WILL NOW JOIN WITH THE REPUBLIC OF CHINA IN REDOUBLING THE EFFORTS TO MAINTAIN AND STRENGTHEN THE FRIENDLY RELATIONS BETWEEN THEM AND THAT, AT LEAST, IT WILL NOT ALLOW THESE RELATIONS TO SUFFER FROM FURTHER SETBACKS.\n9. (4) IT WILL ALSO BE RECALLED THAT PRESIDENT NIXON AND DR. KISSINGER, UPON THEIR RETURN FROM THE VISIT TO THE CHINESE MAINLAND IN FEBRUARY 1972, ADVISED THE GOVERN- MENT OF THE REPUBLIC OF CHINA THROUGH AMBASSADOR JAMES SHEN IN WASHINGTON THAT, IN THEIR JUDGEMENT, UPHEAVALS WERE BOUND TO OCCUR AND TO GIVE RISE TO CHANGES ON THE MAINLAND WITHIN THREE TO FIVE YEARS AND  THAT IN THE CIR- CUMSTANCES THE REPUBLIC OF CHINA SHOULD REMAIN STEADY AND PREPARE FOR SUCH CHANGES. THE DEVELOPMENT ON THE MAIN- LAND IN RECENT MONTHS HAS FULLY JUSTIFIED THE VIEWS OF PRESIDENT NIXON AND DR. KISSINGER. AT THIS TIME WHEN THE CHINESE COMMUNISTS ARE FACING GRAVE DIFFICULTIES BOTH WITHIN AND ABROAD, IT APPEARS DESIRABLE FOR THE UNITED STATES TO FOLLOW A STEADY COURSE, TAKING INTO FULL ACCOUNT THE SITUATION THAT WILL RESULT FROM THOSE ANTICIPATED CHANGES ON THE CHINESE MAINLAND.

WHILE THIS HEEL-DRAGGING FORCED A WORRISOME DELAY, MRS. MEIR--AFTER TWO URGENT MEETINGS WITH U.S. AMBASSADOR KENNETH KEATING--FINALLY ORDERED MAJ. GEN. AHARON YARIV TO SIGN THE PACT EARLY THIS WEEK.\n4.  QUOTE:  DESPITE ALL THE APPARENT PLUSES IN THE AGREE- MENT FOR ISRAEL, MRS. MEIRS RESERVATIONS WERE UNDER- STANDABLE.  FOR THE PEACE-IS-AT-HAND TONE OF LAST WEEKS MIDEAST ACCORD RAISED OMINOUS PARALLELS TO THE VIETNAM PEACE PACKAGE THAT WAS FAST UNRAVELING 5,000 MILES AWAY. AS IN THOSE EARLIER NEGOTIATIONS, THE KISSINGER STYLE WAS UNMISTAKABLE--A FRAGILE STRUCTURE OF PEACE COMPOSED OF UNWRITTEN UNDERSTANDINGS AND VAGUELY WORDED AGREEMENTS. AND IF THE SECRETARY OF STATE FAILED TO MAKE GOOD ON HIS PRIVATE PLEDGES TO SADAT, THERE WERE MORE THAN ENOUGH DISGRUNTLED HAWKS IN CAIRO READY TO PROPEL EGYPT BACK INTO FULL-SCALE WAR--AND PERHAPS YET ANOTHER FACEDOWN BETWEEN THE U.S. AND THE SOVIET UNION.\n5.  QUOTE:  INDEED, AS KISSINGER FLEW TOWARD CAIRO LAST WEEK, SADAT WAS COMING UNDER INCREASING PRESSURE FROM HIS GENERALS AND CLOSE POLITICAL ADVISERS TO RESUME THE WAR. THE EGYPTIAN PUBLIC WAS JUST BECOMING AWARE OF THE DIRE PLIGHT OF THE 20,000 MEN OF THE THIRD ARMY, AND THE EGYPTIAN GENERALS WERE CONVINCED THAT THEY COULD EITHER ELIMINATE THE ISRAELI BULGE ON THE WEST BANK OF THE CANAL UNCLASSIFIED OR FAILING THAT, TRIGGER A WIDER WAR THAT MIGHT DRAG SOVIET AND U.S. TROOPS INTO THE COMBAT ZONE.  EITHER WAY, THE GENERALS THOUGHT THE RESULT WOULD BE AN IMPROVEMENT-- AND THEY WERE PRESSING SADAT TO MAKE A MOVE.\n6.  QUOTE:  IN A TOUGH SESSION IN THE ORNATE SALON OF THE TAHRA PALACE, REPORTED NEWSWEEKS ARNAUD DE BORCHGRAVE, KISSINGER AND SADAT WORKED OUT A CEASE-FIRE AGREEMENT THAT WOULD PROVIDE A SUPPLY CORRIDOR TO THE THIRD ARMY. BUT BEYOND THIS, THE SECRETARY OF STATE URGED SADAT TO GIVE HIM TIME.  THE ISRAELIS, HE ARGUED, COULD BE PERSUADED AS PART OF A PEACE SETTLEMENT TO WITHDRAW-- IN NO MORE THAN A YEAR--FROM THE SINAI.  WHILE SADATS TOP ADVISERS REMAINED AT BEST SKEPTICAL THAT A WATERGATE- WEAKENED PRESIDENT NIXON COULD REALLY BRING THIS MUCH PRESSURE ON JERUSALEM, THE EGYPTIAN PRESIDENT WAS INCLINED\n7.  IN DESCRIBING SISCOS TEL AVIV ARRIVAL, ARTICLE SAID: QUOTE:  IMMEDIATELY UPON ARRIVAL, SISCO DROVE TO THE MODEST DUPLEX COTTAGE IN TEL AVIV THAT MRS. MEIR SHARES WITH HER SON.  WAITING FOR SISCO WITH THE PRIME MINISTER WERE DEFENSE MINISTER MOSHE DAYAN, DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER YIGAL ALLON AND GENERAL YARIV (THE MAN IN CHARGE OF ALL ISRAELI CEASE-FIRE NEGOTIATIONS).  IN HER MEETING THE WEEK BEFORE WITH PRESIDENT NIXON, MRS. MEIR HAD INSISTED THAT THE EXCHANGE OF PRISONERS OF WAR WAS A HUMANITARIAN ISSUE. IT COULD NOT BE LINKED TO THE RELIEF OF THE TRAPPED EGYPTIAN THIRD ARMY.  ON THIS, SHE WAS UNYIELDING.  NOW, MRS. MEIR WAS TOLD THAT TO GET ISRAELS 450 POWS BACK, SHE WOULD HAVE TO AGREE TO A U.N. RELIEF CORRIDOR TO THE THIRD ARMY.  IT WAS A TOUGH PILL TO SWALLOW, AND WHEN SISCO LEFT, MRS. MEIR ASKED ALLON AND YARIV TO REMAIN UNCLASSIFIED BEHIND.  THE NEXT MORNING, MRS. MEIR PROPOSED SOME MODIFICATIONS TO SISCO WHICH HE READILY ACCEPT E E E E E E E E\n",1120340

AS FIRST ORDER OF BUSINESS, GOI REPS AGREED THAT HENCEFORTH ALL COMMUNICATIONS FROM CIVILAVIA RELATING TO MATTERS COVERED IN ATA (E.G., RATES AND SCHEDULES) WULD BE TRNSMITTED TO EMBASSY THROUGH MFA. (MFA INDICATED IT VERY UPSET AT CIVILAVIAS DIRECT COMMUNICATIONS\n5. IN ORDER PREVENT FUTURE IRREGULAR FILINGS, CIVILAVIA STATED ITS INTENTION TO PUBLISH MINISTERIAL DECREE IN OFFICIAL GAZETTE SETTING FORTH PROCEDURES FOR FILING RATES WITH CIVILAVIA. EMBOFF SAID THIS INTERNAL GOI MATTER BUT NOTED THAT LACK OF SUCH PROCEDURES WAS IN LARGE PART RESPONSIBLE FOR PRESENT SITUATION.\n6. EMBOFF THEN PRESENTED U.S. PROPOSAL DESCRIBED REFTEL. AFTER SEVER- AL QUESTIONS RE PROTECTION OF ALITALIA INTERESTS DURING PERIOD BEFORE CONSULATIONS IN JANUARY, ITALIAN DELEGATION LEFT CONFERENCE ROOM TO DISCUSS OFFER. AFTER TWENTY (20) MINUTES HEATED DISCUSSION, DELEGATION RETURNED AND PUCCIONI ANNOUNCED U.S. OFFER HAD BEEN REJECTED BECAUSE ALITALIA CERTAIN LOW RATES WOULD HARM ITS COMMERCIAL INTERESTS. EMBOFF REPEATED PREVIOUS ARGUMENT THAT NO CARGO HAD YET MOVED AT 15/30 TON RATES AND THEREFORE ALITALIA COULD NOT CLAIM IT HAD BEEN HARMED TO DATE; MOREOVER, U.S. PROPOSAL FULLY PROTECTED ALITALIA DURING INTERIM. ALITALIA REPS, OBVIOUSLY UNDER FIRM INSTRUCTION,REFUSED TO DISCUSS THIS ASPECT FURTHER.\n7. PUCCIONI THEN PRESENTED GOI LEGAL POSITION (SEE PARA 2 ABOVE), WHICH IS BASIS FOR REFUSAL U.S. PROPOSAL. GOI SEES NO NEED TO ACCEPT U.S. PROPOSAL WHEN IT ALREADY, IN ITS VIEW, ENTITLED TAKE UNILATERAL ACTION EFFECTIVE NOV  19 UNDER PROVISIONS ARTICLE 10 (G) OF ATA TO REVOKE SEABOARDS, 15 AND 30 TON RATES. EMBOFF REPLIED THAT USG CANNOT AGREE THAT CIVILAVIAS SEPT 19 MESSAGE MEETS THE REQUIREMENTS OF ARTICLE 10(E) ; IT WAS NOT A CLEAR EXPRESSION OF DISSATISFACTION; LIMITED OFFICIAL USE\n8. CIVIAVIA TELEGRAM 327332/32.1 OF NOV 15 TO SEABOARD STATES: QTE. FURTHER TO OUR TELEGRAM NO. 322369/32.1 SENT TO YOUR COMPANY ON SEPT 19, 1973, THIS MINISTRY, APPLYING TO EXPIRATION TIME ENVISAGED BY ARTICLE 10 OF THE U.S.-ITALY AIR TRANSPORT AGREEMENT, WARNS YOUR COMPANY AGAINST THE USE AFTER NOVEMBER 19, 1973 OF THE CARGO RATES PRESENTED IN YOUR LETTER OF AUGUST 27, 1973, CONFIRMING ONCE AGAIN OUR FIRM INTENTION, OTHERWISE, TO APPLY FULLY THE MEASURES ENVISAGED IN PARAGRAPH G OF ARTICLE 10 OF THE AIR TRNSPORT AGREEMENT. UNQTE.\n9. IN RESPONSE TO EMBOFFS QUERY, CIVILAVIA REPS STATED THEY WOULD HAVE NO RPT NO BASIS FOR REJECTING AS SEABOARD REQUEST FOR IATA- APPROVED 30 TONS RATES EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 1974.\n0. EMBOFF CLOSED DISCUSSION BY NOTING THAT GOI REJECTION OF REASON- ABLE U.S. OFFICER WHICH FULLY PROTECTED ALITALIA INTERESTS WAS NOT CONDUCIVE TO THE PROMOTION OF HARMONIOUS U.S.-ITALY BILATERAL CIVIL AVIATION RELATIONS.\n1.

EMBASSY SEES NO RPT NO HOPE OF SHIFTING ALITALIA POSITION (AND THEREFORE CIVILAVIA OF MFA). ALTHOUGH BOTH MFA AND CIVILAVIA APPARENTLY WILLING ACCEPT U.S. PROPOSAL, ALITALIAS ADAMANT REFUSAL EFFECTIVELY SETTLE MATTER. WHILE UNHAPPY OVER IATA-APPROVED 30 TON RATE, THERE IS NO LEGAL BASIS ON WHICH ALITALIA CAN ARGUE FOR REJECTION OF SUCH A RATE AFTER JANUARY 1, 1974. HENCE CIVILAVIA WILLING APPROVE A REQUEST FOR THIS RATE BUT NOT A LESSER 30 TON RATE OF 15 TON RATE NOT SANCTIONED BY IATA. THIS BEING THE CASE,EMBASSY SEES LITTLE POINT IN U.S. RE- QUESTING CARGO RATE CONSULTATIONS UNTIL SUCH TIME AS IT OBVIOUS LOWER RATES IN OTHER MARKETS ARE ADVERSELY AFFECTING ALITALIA LIFTINGS FROM ITALY, EVEN THOUGH GOI HAS INDICATED TO EMBASSY IT WILLING HOLD SUCH CONSULTATIONS IN TANDEM WITH JANUARY ""EX-POST"" SUMMER SEASON CAPACITY CONSULTATIONS IF USG SO REQUESTS.\n3. DESPITE VARYING LEGAL VIEWS OF USG AND GOI RE INTERPRETATION OF ARTICLE 10 OF ATA, ONLY OPERATIONAL QUESTION IS WHETHER SEABOARD COULD APPLY 15/30 TON RATES UNTIL SOME TIME IN JANUARY. DEPARTMENT SHOULD CAREFULLY CONSIDER WHETHER ADMITTEDLY SMALL LIFTINGS THAT MIGHT\n4. EMBASSY RECOMMENDS CLOSING CASE THROUGH NOTE (IN REPLY TO NOTE CONFIRMING GOI LEGAL POSITION DESCRIBED ABOVE, WHICH MFA NOW PREPARING) FULLY EXPLAINING USG LEGAL POSITION BUT NOTING THAT NEW GOI PROCEDURES WILL FORECLOSE FUTURE SUCH DISPUTES. SEABOARD SHOULD IN THIS CASE FILE FOR IATA-APPROVED 30 TON RATE EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 1974. VOLPE\n",1122784

AS TITO WILL BE GOING TO MOSCOW SHORTLY, POSSIBLY AS EARLY AS NOVEMBER 12, EARLY DESPATCH OF PRESIDENTS LETTER WOULD SEEM ADVISABLE.  \n2.  BEGIN TEXT:  DEAR MR. PRESIDENT:          YOUR LETTER OF NOVEMBER 3 SETTING FORTH YOUR VIEWS ON THE PRESENT CRISIS IN THE MIDDLE EAST AND THE STEPS TO ACHIEVE A LASTING SOLUTION TO THIS CRISIS HAS BEEN LIMITED OFFICIAL USE   LIMITED OFFICIAL USE  STUDIED CAREFULLY.  BECAUSE OF THE CLOSE PERSONAL RELA- TIONSHIPS YOU HAVE MAINTAINED FOR MANY YEARS WITH THE LEADERS OF SEVERAL IMPORTANT COUNTRIES IN THE MIDDLE EAST AND THE CAREFUL ATTENTION YOU HAVE GIVEN TO DEVELOPMENTS IN THE AREA, YOUR ASSESSMENTS OF THE SITUATION THERE HAVE ALWAYS BEEN OF INTEREST.          AS YOU OBSERVED IN YOUR LETTER, YUGOSLAVIA AND THE US HAVE WIDELY DIVERGENT VIEWS CONCERNING THE ORIGIN AND NATURE OF THE PRESENT CRISIS IN THE MIDDLE EAST.  IN LIGHT OF THESE DIFFERENCES, MR. PRESIDENT, I BELIEVE IT WOULD BE USEFUL FOR ME TO OUTLINE US AIMS SINCE THE   OUTBREAK OF THE RECENT ROUND OF FIGHTING IN THE AREA.          THROUGHOUT THE PRESENT CRISIS THE US HAS DIRECTED ITS EFFORTS TOWARD THE ACHIEVEMENT OF TWO OBJECTIVES: THE CESSATION OF HOSTILITIES AND THE CREATION OF CONDITIONS CONDUCIVE TO PROGRESS THROUGH NEGOTIATIONS TOWARD A JUST AND DURABLE PEACE.  THE US PURSUED THESE OBJECTIVES AT THE UNITED NATIONS AND IN DIPLOMATIC CONSULTATIONS WITH THE PARTIES TO THE CONFLICT, THE PERMANENT MEMBERS OF THE SECURITY COUNCIL, AND OTHER INTERESTED GOVERNMENTS.          IN RECENT DAYS WE HAVE BEEN ENGAGED IN A MAJOR EFFORT TO CONSOLIDATE THE CEASEFIRE SO THAT IT WILL BE POSSIBLE FOR THE PARTIES TO THE CONFLICT TO MOVE ON TOWARDS A MORE PERMANENT PHASE OF NEGOTIATION.  IT WAS IN PURSUIT OF THESE GOALS THAT WE CONSULTED WITH REPRESENTATIVES OF THE GOVERNMENTS OF EGYPT, ISRAEL AND SYRIA IN WASHINGTON LAST WEEK, AND THAT SECRETARY KISSINGER AND HIS PARTY TRAVELED TO SEVERAL ARAB CAPITALS TO ENGAGE IN PERSONAL TALKS WITH ARAB LEADERS.         WE ARE PLEASED THAT AFTER PAINSTAKING US EFFORTS, AN AGREEMENT BETWEEN EGYPT AND ISRAEL HAS BEEN REACHED WHICH CONSTITUTES AN IMPORTANT STEP TOWARD STABILIZATION OF THE CEASEFIRE.  IN THIS AGREEMEN, THE DETAILS OF WHICH ARE FAMILIAR TO YOU, EGYPT AND ISRAEL HAVE AGREED LIMITED OFFICIAL USE   LIMITED OFFICIAL USE  TO TAKE THE FOLLOWING STEPS:  TO OBSERVE SCRUPULOUSLY THE CEASEFIRE CALLED FOR BY THE UNITED NATIONS SECURITY COUNCIL; TO UNDERTAKE DISCUSSIONS IMMEDIATELY TO SETTLE THE QUESTION OF THE RETURN TO THE OCTOBER 22 POSITIONS; TO ASSURE THAT THE TOWN OF SUEZ WILL RECEIVE DAILY SUPPLIES OF FOOD, WATER AND MEDICINE AND THAT ALL WOUNDED CIVILIANS THERE WILL BE EVACUATED; TO PERMIT THE UNIMPEDED MOVEMENT OF NON-MILITARY SUPPLIES TO THE EAST BANK OF THE SUEZ CANAL; TO REPLACE THE ISRAELI CHECKPOINTS ON THE CAIRO-SUEZ ROAD WITH UN CHECKPOINTS, WHILE PERMITTING ISRAELI OFFICERS TO PARTICIPATE WITH UNITED NATIONS PERSONNEL IN THE SUPERVISION AT THE SUEZ END OF THE ROAD AT THE BANK OF THE CANAL OF THE NON- MILITARY NATURE OF THE CARGO; AND TO EXCHANGE ALL PRISONERS OF WAR, INCLUDING WOUNDED, AS SOON AS THE UNITED NATIONS CHECKPOINTS ARE ESTABLISHED ON THE CAIRO-SUEZ ROAD.  ALTHOUGH UNDOUBTEDLY THERE WILL BE   RECURRENT DIFFICULTIES BEFORE THE CEASEFIRE IS FULLY STABILIZED, WE ARE CONFIDENT THAT THESE CAN BE OVERCOME WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF THIS BASIC AGREEMENT.         THE US CONTINUES TO BELIEVE THAT A JUST AND DURABLE PEACE MUST BE BASED ON THE PROVISIONS OF UNITED NATIONS SECURITY COUNCIL RESOLUTION 242 IN ALL ITS PARTS.  WE ARE HOPEFUL THAT THE RECENT CEASEFIRE AGREEMENT WILL LEAD IN THE NEAR FUTURE TO A PROCESS OF NEGOTIATION BETWEEN THE PARTIES UNDER APPROPRIATE AUSPICES.  FOR THESE NEGOTIATIONS TO BE FRUITFUL, A FIRM DEDICATION TO THE NEGOTIATING PROCESS AND A WILLINGNESS ON THE PART OF ALL PARTIES TO SEEK ACCOMMODATIONS ON THE DIFFICULT AND INTRACTABLE ISSUES WHICH HAVE DIVIDED THEM WILL BE REQUIRED.         I AM HOPEFUL, THEREFORE, MR. PRESIDENT, THAT YOU AND YOUR GOVERNMENT WILL JOIN WITH THE US AND OTHER INTERESTED GOVERNMENTS IN ENCOURAGING THE PARTIES CONCERNED TO APPROACH SUCH NEGOTIATIONS IN A SPIRIT OF GOODWILL AND ACCOMMODATION AND TO AVOID ACTIONS ELSEWHERE WHICH WOULD NOT BE CONDUCIVE TO A FAVORABLE LIMITED OFFICIAL USE   LIMITED OFFICIAL USE  NEGOTIATING ATMOSPHERE.

YASUKAWA SCHEDULED DEPART FOR TOKYO MORNING NOV 11.  \n2.  RELEASE BY GOJ OF TEXT OF ARAB-ISRAELI AGREEMENT - ACTING SECY SAID IT MOST UNFORTUNATE AND EMBARRASSING THAT GOJ HAD RELEASED TEXT OF AGREEMENT, EVEN UNDER EMBARGO WELL IN ADVANCE OF SCHEDULED PRESIDENTIAL ANNOUNCEMENT. YASUKAWA AGREED INCIDENT WAS UNFORTUNATE BUT HAD NO EXPLANATION TO OFFER.  \n3.  ARAB-ISRAELI AGREEMENT - IN RESPONSE YASUKAWAS REQUEST FOR INFORMATION REGARDING NEGOTIATING HISTORY, ACTING SECY SAID THAT SECYS TALKS IN WASHINGTON WITH EGYPTIAN FONMIN AND PRIMIN MEIR HAD CLARIFIED THE ESSENTIAL ISSUES,    SECRET  MAKING POSSIBLE THE ULTIMATE AGREEMTENT.  FIRST AGREEMENT WAS REACHED ONLY AFTER SECY HAD BEEN ABLE TO CLEAR UP EGYPTIAN MISUNDERSTANDINGS AND CONCERNS WITH PRESIDENT SADAT IN CAIRO AND ASST SECY SISCO HAD SATISFIED CONCERNS OF ISRAELI LEADERSHIP DURING HIS VISIT TO ISRAEL.  FACT THAT ISRAELIS KNEW THAT EGYPTIANS HAD ALREADY AGREED TO PROPOSED SETTLEMENT WITH SECY WAS IMPORTANT FACTOR IN BRINGING ISRAELIS ALONG.  \n4.  ACTING SECY SAID ISRAELI INSISTENCE ON CONTROL OF ROAD TO SUEZ HAD BEEN ONE MAJOR OBSTACLE.  COMPROMISE REACHED THROUGH SECYS AND SISCOS EFFORTS PERMITS SUPPLY OF CITY OF SUEZ AND EGYPTIAN THIRD ARMY WITH NON-MILITARY NECESSITIES WHILE GIVING UN CONTROL OF CHECKPOINTS WITH ISRAELIS PARTICIPATING AT LAST CHECKPOINT.  \n5.  EGYPTIAN UNWILLINGNESS TO CONSIDER POW EXCHANGE UNTIL ISRAELIS HAD OPENED ROAD, AND WITHDRAWN FORCES TO OCT 22 POSITIONS HAD BEEN SECOND MAJOR OBSTACLE.  EGYPTIANS ARE NOW WILLING TO EXCHANGE PRISONERS ON BASIS PLACING CHECK- POINTS UNDER UN CONTROL AS DESCRIBED IN PARA 4 ABOVE WITH RESUPPLY OF 3RD ARMY AND CITY OF SUEZ ASSURED.  \n6.  ACTING SEC SAID SOVS HAD NOT PLAYED ACTIVE ROLE IN ACHIEVING THIS AGREEMENT, AND POINTED OUT THAT ONLY USG IN POSITION TO TALK TO BOTH PARTIES.  ISRAELIS WOULD NOT TALK TO SOVIETS AND OBVIOUSLY USG COULD NOT APPROACH ARABS THROUGH SOVIETS.  USG HAD, HOWEVER, KEPT LINES OF COMMUNI- CATION TO MOSCOW OPEN AND HAD KEPT SOVIET GOVERNMENT FULLY INFORMED.  PROBLEMS WHICH CAUSED US TO ALERT OUR FORCES COULD HAVE BEEN MORE SERIOUS HAD WE NOT HAD OPEN LINES OF COMMUNICATION THROUGH WHICH TO CLEAR THEM UP.  \n7.  ARAB PRESSURES ON JAPANESE - YASUKAWA SAID GOJ REMAINS UNDER STRONG PRESSURE FROM ARABS, SOME OF WHOM GO SO FAR AS TO INSIST GOJ SEVER RELATIONS WITH ISRAEL.  THIS JAPAN CANNOT DO.  HE ASSURED ACTING SECY THAT CHIEF CABINET SECYS STATEMENT ON JAPANESE POSITION, WHICH HAD BEEN MISINTERPRETED BY PRESS TO REFLECT VIEW THAT JAPAN ADOPTING NEW PRO-ARAB STANCE, HAD NOT IN FACT GONE BEYOND EARLIER GOJ POSITION THAT JAPAN COULD NOT SUPPORT ARAB    SECRET  POSITION THAT ISRAELIS MUST WITHDRAW FORCES FROM OCCUPIED TERRITORY PRIOR TO NEGOTIATIONS.  JAPANS POSTION REMAINS THAT PARTIES SHOULD ABIDE BY CEASEFIRE, BUT JAPAN REGARDS UN RESOLUTION 242 AS COMPLETE PACKAGE.  NEVERTHELESS ARAB PRESSURE HAS MADE DOMESTIC POSITION OF GOJ ""RATHER SHAKY"". GOJ WILL LIVE UP TO SECYS REQUEST TO AWAIT HIS DIS- CUSSIONS WITH GOJ BEFORE TAKING ANY FURTHER ACTION.  \n8.  ACTING SECY AGREED THIS VERY IMPORTANT AND THAT SECY WILL BE PREPARED FOR FULL DISCUSSION WITH JAPANESE WHEN HE REACHES TOKYO.  HE ADDED IT CLEAR THAT UNLESS NATIONS WHICH ARE TARGETS OF ARAB PRESSURE MAINTAIN SOLID FRONT, POSITION OF BOTH JAPANESE AND EUROPEANS WILL BECOME MUCH WORSE.  WITHOUT UNITED FRONT, WE WOULD FIND OURSELVES IN INTOLERABLE POSITION WHEREBY ARABS CAN USE OIL TO RUN OUR FOREIGN POLICY AND THAT OF OTHER OIL CONSUMING COUNTRIES.  \n9.  IN RESPONSE YASUKAWAS QUERY, ACTING SECY SAID THAT, SO FAR AS HE KNEW, SECY HAD NOT DISCUSSED LIFTING OF OIL PRODUCTION CUTBACKS WITH SADAT (EGYPTIANS REALLY NOT DIRECTLY INVOLVED) AND HE NOT YET INFORMED OF RESULTS OF ANY DISCUSSION SECY MAY HAVE HAD ON THIS SUBJECT WITH KING FAISAL.  \n0.  YASUKAWA SAID HE INSTRUCTED INFORM USG THAT GOJ PRIMARILY CONCERNED WITH EVENTUAL SETTLEMENT ARAB-ISRAELI DISPUTE AND OIL PROBLEM, AND MAY OFFER SOME IDEAS OF ITS OWN DURING SECYS VISIT TOKYO.  HE EXPRESSED HOPE SECY WOULD BE PREPARED ALSO DISCUSS HIS OWN IDEAS WITH JAPANESE LEADERS.  \n1.  KOREA - YASUKAWA SAID KOREAN QUESTION WOULD BE ON TOKYO AGENDA AND ASKED ABOUT RESULTS OF US-PRCMEETING ON KOREA IN NEW YORK NOV 8.  ACTING SECY RESPONDED THAT DISCUSSION HAD BEEN PRIMARILY ABOUT ADVISABILITY OF DISSOLUTION OF UNCURK WITH OTHER ISSUES TO BE HELD IN ABEYANCE.  \n2.  CAMBODIA - NOTING THAT SOVIETS HAVE CHANGED THEIR POSITION TO SUPPORT REPRESENTATION OF SIHANOUK IN CAMBODIAN UN MEMBERSHIP ISSUE, YASUKAWA SAID GOJ NOW    SECRET  PESSIMISTIC ABOUT RESULTS IF MEMBERSHIP ISSUE COMES TO VOTE.  THERE SOME INDICATIONS, HOWEVER, THAT SIHANOUK SUPPORTERS NO LONGER INTERESTED IN EARLY ACTION AND THERE APPARENTLY SOME CHANCE THAT ISSUE WILL NO COME TO VOTE.  \n3.  ACTING SECY RESPONDED THAT WE FEEL THAT LON NOL GOVT WOULD WIN IF MATTER VOTED ON AND THAT IT WOULD BE INTOLERABLE TO PERMIT UN MEMBERSHIP FOR SIHANOUK.  HE NOTED THAT OTHER SIDE IS DIVIDED ON ISSUE AND THAT SIHANOUK IS NOW PESSIMISTIC ABOUT ABILITY OF INSURGENTS TO OVERTHROW LON NOL GOVT AND UNHAPPY ABOUT LACK OF SUPPLIES FROM HANOI AND FACT THAT HE NOT REGARDED BY INSURGENTS AS THEIR LEADER BUT INSTEAD AS SOME SORT OF INTERMEDIARY.  HE EXPRESSED THE HOPE THAT JAPAN WOULD STRONGLY BACK LON NOL IN THE UN.  \n4.  YASUKAWA SAID OUTCOME OF UN VOTE MIGHT AFFECT JAPANESE ATTITUDES TOWARD ESF.  JAPANESE CONTRIBUTED DOLS\n",1112975

DURING THE TWO MEETINGS HELD ON 29TH OCTOBER, THE OPENING STATE- MENTS OF GERMANY, LUXEMBOURG, NORWAY AND THE UNITED STATES WERE FINALISED. THE GROUP AUTHORIZED THE BELGIAN REPRESENTATIVE TO PROCEED TO THE DETERMINATION BY THE DRAWING OF LOTS OF THE CHAIRMAN FOR THE FIRST PLENARY MEETING (THE UNITED KINGDOM IN THE EVENT). IT WAS AGREED THAT MATTERS CONCERNING THE ORGANIZATION AND CONDUCT OF THE FIRST SESSION AND OF PRESS POLICY SHOULD BE DISCUSSED DURING A QUADRIPARTITE MEETING (BELGIUM, THE UNITED STATES, POLAND AND THE SOVIET UNION); THE RESULTS, REPORTED TO THE GROUP BY THE BELGIAN REPRESENTATIVE LATER IN THE DAY, INCLUDED AGREEMENT ON THESE ARRANGEMENTS INCLUDING THE INITIAL FREQUENCY OF PLENARIES (TWICE WEEKLY) AND THE POWERS OF THEIR CHAIRMEN.\n4.  CONSIDERATION WAS ALSO GIVEN TO THE DATA BASE.  IT WAS DECIDED ON\n5.

SUBSEQUENT TO THE PLENARY SESSIONS OF 30TH AND 31ST OCTOBER, THE GROUP CONSIDERED IN DETAIL THE OPENING STATEMENTS MADE BY THE EASTERN PARTICIPANTS.

IN THE LIGHT OF THE ASSESSMENT MADE OF THE SOVIET POSITION, CONFIDENTIAL IT WAS AGREED THAT FOR THE PRESENT, DELIVERING A SEPARATE STATEMENT ON TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE INTERESTS OF OTHERS (THEME 3) WOULD ONLY ENCOURAGE THE OTHER SIDE TO PURSUE THE ISSUE OF THE PARTICIPATION OF NEUTRAL STATES IN THE CONFERENCE.\n8.  WITH RESPECT TO INTERNAL POLICY ON INFORMING NON-PARTICIPATING NATIONS, THE CONSENSUS REACHED IN THE SENIOR POLITICAL COMMITTEE WAS NOTED AND IT WAS AGREED ACCORDINGLY THAT IT WOULD BE UP TO THESE COUNTRIES TO SEEK INFORMATION INDIVIDUALLY AND THAT WHAT WAS PROVIDED WOULD RESEMBLE, IN CONTENT, THE BACKGROUND INFORMATION WHICH THE GROUP WOULD DECIDE FROM TIME TO TIME MIGHT BE GIVEN TO THE PRESS.\n9.

FOLLOWING IS TEXT OF LE MONDE INTERVIEW WITH PRINCE SIHANOUK ARTICLE REQUESTED IN REFTEL:   BEGIN QUOTE.  SIHANOUK INTERVIEW IN LE MONDE. PARIS LE MONDE IN FRENCH 27 OCT 73.   (ALAIN BOUC INTERVIEW WITH RGNUC CHIEF OF STATE PRINCE NORODOM SIHANOUK: I WILL NOT RETURN TO CAMBODIA; I WILL REMAIN IN PEKING UNTIL I DIE, SUBTITLED RGNUC HEAD CRITICIZES HANOI AND THE KHMER ROUGE)   (TEXT) -- THE HOUR OF CLARIFICATION HAS COME FOR RGNUC ROYAL GOVERNMENT OF NATIONAL UNION OF CAMBODIA), THE KHMER ROUGE, AND PRINCE SIHANOUK.  THE PRINCE, WHO HAD A LONG INTERVIEW WITH US IN HIS RESIDENCE ON ANTI-IMPERIALIST STREET, GAVE EVIDENCE SIMULTANEOUSLY OF ANXIETY, LIMITED OFFICIAL USE   LIMITED OFFICIAL USE  IRRITATION, AND EVEN A HINT OF SADNESS.  HIS REMOTENESS FROM HIS COUNTRY WEIGHTS ON HIM, VICTORY IS SLOW IN COMING, AND HE IS NO LONGER SURE OF WHAT THE FUTURE AND THE RESISTANCE HOLD FOR HIM.   LET US ADMIT FRANKLY, OUR WEAKNESS IS PATENT; IT CANNOT BE HIDDEN. DESPITE ALL OUR VICTORY BULLETINS, THE LON NOL REGIME IS STILL THERE.  IF IT IS WEAK AND WE CANNOT OVERTHROW IT, WE ARE EVEN WEAKER STILL. IF, ON THE OTHER HAND, IT IS STILL POWERFUL, WHY KILL IT?  THE TRUTH, AS CONFIRMED SEVERAL TIMES BY THE HEAD OF RGNUC, IS THAT THE RESISTANCE CRUELLY LACKS ARMS AND AMMUNITION.  OF COURSE WE SERVE IN THE OPPOSITE CAMP, BUT THERE IS SUCH A DIS- PROPORTIONATE BALANCE COMPARED TO WHAT NIXON SENDS TO PHNOM PENH EVERY DAY:   LAST JANUARYS PARIS AGREEMENTS RESULTED IN THE DISRUPTION OF SUPPLIES FROM NORTH VIETNAM.  THE SENDING OF AID FROM THE DRV WAS BLOCKED.  NOT COMPLETELY, BUT ALMOST.  IN ANY CASE, THE RESISTANCE DID NOT HAVE THE MEANS TO OCCUPY KOMPONG CHAM AND KEEP IT.  THE PRINCE TRIED TO EXPLAIN THE HANOI LEADERS MOVEMENTS.   IN MY OPINION, THE UNITED STATES IS SEEKING TO STABILIZE THE SITUATION IN CAMBODIA BY AWAITING A SETTLEMENT OF THE WHOLE INDOCHINA QUESTION.  IT INFORMED NORTH VIETNAM THAT IF HANOI AIDED THE KHMER ROUGE TO THE POINT OF THEIR BEING ABLE TO OVERTHROW LON NOL, IT  THE UNITED STATES -- WOULD BE OBLIGED TO INTERVENE AGAIN.  THIS IS UNDERSTANDABLE: IF WE WIN, ALL THEIR CONSTRUCTION IN SOUTHEAST ASIA IS LIABLE TO COLLAPSE.   THE SECOND REASON IS THAT HANOI CANNOT ENDANGER THE PAYMENT OF AMERICAS WAR DEBTS, WHAT THE UNITED STATES CALLS RECONSTRUCTION AID FOR VIETNAM.   FINALLY, IT SHOULD BE KNOWN THAT HANOI AND THE NLF HAVE DRAWN UP A PLAN FOR THE COUNTRYS REUNIFICATION, WHICH REQUIRES TIME.  THEY CONSIDER THAT A NEW CONFRONTATION WITH THE SAIGON REGIME IS INEVITABLE.  THE IMPORTANT THING FOR THEM IS THAT THE UNITED STATES DOES NOT PARTICIPATE LIMITED OFFICIAL USE   LIMITED OFFICIAL USE  DIRECTLY IN THE NEW CONFLICT;  IN ANY CASE, THAT IT DOES NOT RESUME BOMBING NORTH VIETNAM.  TO OBTAIN A COMPLETE AMERICAN WITHDRAWAL, SOME TIME MUST BE ALLOWED TO PASS-- SO THAT THE UNITED STATES GETS USED TO PEACE AND IT BECOMES IMPOSSIBLE FOR NIXON TO AGAIN LAUNCH HIS COUNTRY INTO WAR. YOU MAY NOTE, CONTINUED THE PRINCE, POINTING TO A MAP, THAT THE TRANSPORT OF ARMS BETWEEN THE TWO VIETNAMS DOES NOT REQUIRE THE TAKING OF PHNOM PENH: THE HO CHI MINH TRAILS PASS THROUGH REGIONS INACCESSIBLE TO LON NOLS TROOPS.   THE DISRUPTION OF THE NORTH VIETNAMESE CHANNEL IS THUS APPARENTLY BEHIND THE RESISTANCES MAIN DIFFICULTIES. KIM IL-SONG, THE NORTH KOREAN CHIEF OF STATE, PROPOSED SUPPLYING US WITH AS MUCH AS WE WANTED, BUT TO WHAT GOOD, SINCE THIS MATERIAL COULD NOT BE TRANSPORTED ONCE IT ARRIVED AT THE DRVS BORDERS? THE SAME PROBLEM EXISTS FOR CHINESE AID, WITH THE ADDITION THAT PEKING DOES NOT WISH, IN ITS NEGOTIATIONS WITH AMERICA, THAT IT BE REPROACHED BY THE UNITED STATES FOR ADDING FUEL TO THE FIRE IN INDOCHINA.  THEREFORE, CHINA SHOWS NO ENTHUSIASM FOR THE IDEA OF SENDING ARMS.   MOREOVER, CHINA IS OBLIGED SOMEWHAT TO COURT WASHINGTON TO PREVENT THE FORMATION OF A HOSTILE AMERICAN- SOVIET COALITION.   HOWEVER, IN THIS DELICATE SITUATION THERE APPEARS AN ELEMENT OF COMFORT: GRUNKS RECENT DIPLOMATIC SUCCESSES. THE PRINCE IS COMPLETELY SATISFIED WITH THE SOVIET LEADERS CHANGE IN ATTITUDE. THEIR POSIION IS VERY CLEAR. THEY RECALLED THEIR CHARGE DAFFAIRES AND ALL THEIR DIPLOMATS, LEAVING IN PHNOM PENH ONLY THREE PERSONS WHO ARE NOT OF DIPLOMATIC QUALITY, TO GUARD THE BUILDINGS. THE GDR LEFT ONLY ONE.  THE BULGARIANS REPATRIATED ALL THEIR PERSONNEL.  THE MONGOLIANS RECENTLY RECOGNIZED US. OF COURSE, AS A MATTER OF DIGNITY, THEY CAN NOT ALL FOLLOW MOSCOW, ONE AFTER THE OTHER.  THEY ALLOW A FEW DAYS TO PASS BETWEEN THEIR RESPECTIVE INITIATIVES.  BUT IN THE END, THERE IS NO DOUBT;THE WHOLE BLOC IS COMING OUR WAY.  WE NOW HAVE ALL THE SOCIALIST AND NONALIGNED COUNTRIES WITH LIMITED OFFICIAL USE   LIMITED OFFICIAL USE  US: IT IS A VERY GREAT VICTORY FOR RGNUC, WHICH LON NOL WILL NOT BE ABLE TO MINIMIZE.   WHY DID THE USSR CHANGE ITS ATTITUDE? (SUBHEAD)   WE MUST STILL ASK OURSELVES,  SAID THE PRINCE, PERPLEXED, WHAT WERE THE REASONS WHICH LED MOSCOW TO REVISE ITS ATTITUDE.  WAS IT, AS SOME PEOPLE SAY, TO ANNOY THE CHINESE, WHO HAVE NOT YET BROKEN OFF RELATIONS WITH CHILE? OR RATHER, DOES IT KNOW THAT A LARGE ATTACK IS BEING PREPARED, AND DID IT DECIDE TO REPATRIATE ITS MEN? WHEN THE RUSSIANS ARRIVE, ITS ALWAYS BECAUSE THEY THINK THAT A SOLUTION IS CLOSE; THEY ARE GENERALLY SHREWD.  THEY WISH TO PUSH US TOWARD A POLITICAL SOLUTION. THEN THE PRINCE OUTLINED ON THE MAP SEVERAL HYPOTHETICAL DIVISIONS OF TERRITORY WHICH WOULD PERMIT THE SOIVETS TO BE PRESENT AND LIMIT CHINESE INFLUENCE.  THEY ARE STILL TALKING, THOUGH ONLY TO REJECT THEM, ABOUT TRIPARTITE OR BIPARTITE GOVERNMENTS WHICH WOULD LEAVE THE HEADS OF THE PHNOM PENH REGIME SOME OF THE POWER.   HOWEVER, THE IDEA CANNOT BE DISMISSED THAT PEKING, MOSCOW AND HANOI MAY AGREE WITH THE KHMER ROUGE, WITHOUT CONFERRING WITH ME, TO PREPARE A MASSIVE ATTACK IN THE DRY SEASON.  BUT CERTAINLY WE ASKED YOU WOULD BE INFORMED IN SUCH A CASE?   THAT IS NOT CERTAIN, REPLIED THE PRINCE, I DO NOT HAVE INTIMATE RELATIONS WITH THE KHMER ROUGE; I HAVE NO MORE, I HAVE ALMOST NO RELATIONS WITH THEM.  YES, IT IS TRUE, I HAVE ALREADY SAID THAT I FOUND THEM STALINIST, WITH THEIR DAILY INDOCTRINATION INSTRUCTION, THE LANGUAGE THEY EMPLOY, THEIR METHODS.   THE PRINCE TALKED ON THESE TICKLISH SUBJECTS WITH THE SAME EASE.  BUT HIS EXTREME SENSITIVITY PREVENTED HIM FROM HIDING A DEEP-SEATED SADNESS:  YOU KNOW, THERE ARE WOUNDS WHICH CANNOT BE HEALED.  I TELL YOU, I WILL NOT RETURN TO CAMBODIA, I WILL REMAIN IN PEKING UNTIL I DIE.  MY MOTHER, THE QUEEN, IS GOING TO COME HERE AND WE WILL BOTH REMAIN IN CHINA.  BUT MEANWHILE, I WILL AID THE KHMER ROUGE.  TO LIMITED OFFICIAL USE   LIMITED OFFICIAL USE  SW\n",1112769

AT THE SAME TIME, THEY NOTE THAT IN THE COURSE OF THE PAST TEN YEARS THE FOUNDATIONS OF THEIR COMMON DEFENSE HAVE UNDERGONE MAJOR CHANGES. BEGIN UNDERLINE THE UNITED STATES AND THE SOVIET UNION BEING MUTUALLY VULNERABLE EXCLUSIVELY TO STRATEGIC WEAPONS, THE BALANCE WHICH HAS RESULTED BETWEEN THESE TWO POWERS IN THIS DOMAIN, ESTABLISHES GREAT STABILITY IN THEIR RELATIONS. THE SAME DOES NOT APPLY TO EUROPE, WHICH REMAINS PARTICULARLY VULNERABLE TO ALL  OTHER FORMS OF CONFLICT, AND WHOSE DEFENSE PROBLEM ACQUIRES BY THIS FACT AN INCREASINGLY SPECIFIC CHARACTER. END UNDERLINE\n4. THIS NEW SITUATION IN NO WAY ALTERS THE BASIC FACT THAT, AS MATTERS STAND AT PRESENT - AND THIS IS SOMETHING THE MEMBERS OF THE ALLIANCE WISH TO REAFFIRM - THERE IS NO ALTERNATIVE TO THE SECURITY PROVIDED BY UNITED STATES NUCLEAR FORCES, WHETHER THEY ARE BASED IN THE UNITED STATES OR IN EUROPE.\n5. IT DOES, HOWEVER, MEAN THAT BEGIN UNDERLINE THE ALLIANCE END UNDERLINE MUST TAKE GREATER ACCOUNT OF THE RISKS CONFRONTING IT BEGIN UNDERLINE IN THE EUROPEAN THEATER, AND END UNDERLINE MUST EMPLOY WHATEVER WAYS AND MEANS ARE NEEDED TO AVERT THESE RISKS.

IN THIS CONNECTION, THE MEMBERS OF THE ATLANTIC ALLIANCE AFFIRM THAT AS THE ULTIMATE AIM OF ALL DEFENSE POLICIES IS TO PREVENT A POTENTIAL ADVERSARY FROM REALIZING THE OBJECTIVES HE WOULD IMPOSE BEGIN UNDERLINE AND FOR WHICH HE WOULD HAVE INITIATED A CON- FLICT, END UNDERLINE ALL THE FORCES OF THE MEMBERS OF THE ALLIANCE  WOULD, IF NECESSARY, BE USED TO THIS END.\n7. COMMON DEFENSE IS ONE AND INDIVISIBLE. THE COMMON GOAL IS TO MAINTAIN A POSTURE CAPABLE OF PREVENTING A CONFLICT WHICH WOULD PUT AN END TO EUROPEAN INDEPENDENCE AND THUS CULMINATE IN THE SUB- JUGATION OF THE WORLD.\n8. FROM THIS STANDPOINT IT IS RECOGNIZED THAT A CONTINUED AND SUBSTANTIAL PRESENCE OF AMERICAN FORCES IN EUROPE PLAYS AN IRREPLACE- ABLE ROLE IN THE DEFENSE OF THE UNITED STATES ITSELF, AS WELL AS IN THAT OF THE COUNTRIES OF EUROPE. LIKEWISE, THE EVOLUTION OF THE EUROPEAN ECONOMIC COMMUNITY TOWARDS POLITICAL UNITY SHOULD, IN DUE COURSE, FAVOURABLE AFFECT THE CONTRIBUTION THAT ITS MEMBER NATIONS, WHICH ARE AT THE SAME TIME MEMBERS OF THE ATLANTIC ALLIANCE, MAKE CONFIDENTIAL  TO THE PROBLEM OF DEFENSE.\n9. BEGIN UNDERLINE THE MEMBERS OF THE ALLIANCE BELIEVE THAT THEIR DESIRE TO COMBINE THEIR EFFORTS IN ORDER TO ASSURE THE COMMON DEFENSE OBLIGES THEM TO NEGLECT NOTHING WHICH COULD IMPROVE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THEIR OWN FORCES, EACH COUNTRY ASSUMING, IN RELATION TO ITS PLACE IN THE ALLIANCE, ITS PROPER PART OF THE CHARGES WHICH ASSURE THE SECURITY OF ALL.\n0. THE MEMBERS OF THE ALLIANCE ARE CONVINCED, NOW AS BEFORE, THAT THESE AIMS CANNOT BE ACHIEVED UNLESS THEY CONTINUE AMONG THEM- SELVES CLOSE CONSULTATION AND TRUSTFUL CO-OPERATION ON ALL PROBLEMS OF COMMON INTEREST. BEGIN UNDERLINE SINCE DETENTE AND DEFENSE ARE COMPLEMENTARY, THEY WILL KEEP ONE ANOTHER INFORMED IN PARTICULAR AS TO THE EVOLUTION OF, AND ACHIEVEMENTS IN EAST/WEST RELATIONS. WHILE CONTINUING TO RESPECT THEIR INDIVIDUAL OBLIGATIONS OR THOSE ENGAGEMENTS TO WHICH THEY HAVE SUBSCRIBED JOINTLY, THEY WILL ALSO CONTINUE TO ELIMINATE THE SOURCES OF CONFLICT AMONG THEIR RESPECTIVE ECONOMIC POLICIES AND ENCOURAGE ECONOMIC COOPERATION AMONG THEMSELVES. END UNDERLINE\n1. BEGIN UNDERLINE THEY RECALL THAT THEIR SOLIDARITY IS BASED ON A COMMON ATTACHMENT TO THE CONCEPTS OF DEMOCRACY, A RESPECT FOR THE RIGHTS OF MAN, JUSTICEAND SOCIAL PROGRESS, ALL OF WHICH ARE THE FRUITS OF THEIR COMMON SPIRITUAL HERITAGE. SINCE THESE PRINCIPLES FORBID, BY THEIR VERY ESSENCE, ANY RECOURSE TO METHODS WHICH ARE INCOMPABIBLE WITH THE PROMOTION OF WORLD PEACE, END UNDERLINE THEY REAFFIRM THAT THEIR EFFORTS TO PRESERVE THEIR INDEPENDENCE, TO MAINTAIN THEIR SECURITY AND TO IMPROVE THE STANDARD OF LIVING OF THEIR PEOPLES PRECLUDE AGGRESSION AGAINST ANYONE, THAT THESE EFFORTS ARE NOT  DIRECTED AGAINST ANY OTHER COUNTRY AND THAT THEY ARE DESIGNED  TO BRING ABOUT AN OVERALL IMPROVEMENT IN INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS.\n2. BEGIN UNDERLINE IN DOING THIS, THEY REALIZE THAT THEY ARE PROPOSING TO THEIR PEOPLES, AND ESPECIALLY TO YOUNGER GENERATIONS, A TASK WHICH WILL BE THE EQUAL OF THEIR VITALITY AND AMBITIONS.

AS HE STATED IN COUNCIL DISCUSSION OF ATLANTIC RELATIONS NOVEMBER 21, SIR EDWARD PECK (UK PERMREP) HAS CIRCULATED UK DELEGATION TRANSLATION OF FRENCH DRAFT DECLARATION. AN INFORMAL MISSION TRANSLATION OF THE FRENCH ORIGINAL WAS FORWARDED IN USNATO 5444. TEXT OF UK TRANSLATION FOLLOWS:\n2. BEGIN TEXT:\n1. THE MEMBERS OF THE NORTH ATLANTIC ALLIANCE DECLARE THAT THE TREATY WHICH THEY SIGNED TWENTY-FIVE YEARS AGO, TO PRESERVE THEIR FREEDOM AND INDEPENDENCE AFTER A WAR WHICH HAD ALMOST DEPRIVED THEM OF BOTH, HAS SET THE SEAL ON THE COMMON DESTINY OF THE COUNTRIES OF EUROPE, THE UNITED STATES AND CANADA. UNDER THE PROTECTION OF THE TREATY, WESTERN EUROPE HAS BEEN ABLE TO REBUILD FROM ITS RUINS, TO ATTAIN AN UNPRECEDENTED LEVEL OF PRPOSPERITY AND TO LAY THE FOUNDATIONS OF ITS UNITY, WHILE THE WESTERN WORLD REGAINED ITS SELFCONFIDENCE AND ENSURED THE SPREAD OF THOSE CIVILISED VALUES ASSOCIATED WITH ITS NAME.\n2. MEANWHILE, GREAT PROGRESS HAS BEEN ACHIEVED ON THE ROAD TOWARDS DETENTE AND HARMONY BETWEEN NATIONS, TO A POINT WHERE A CONFERENCE INVOLVING 35 COUNTRIES OF EUROPE AND NORTH AMERICA IS PREPARING TO LAY DOWN THE RIGHT GUIDELINES FOR INCREASING SECURITY AND CO-OPERATION IN EUROPE. THE MEMBERS OF THE ALLIANCE WELCOME THIS; BUT UNTIL CIRCUMSTANCES PERMIT THE INTRODUCTION OF GENRAL, COMPLETE AND CONTROLLED DISARMAMENT, WHICH ALONE COULD PROVIDE GENUINE SECURITY FOR ALL, THEY ARE CONVINCED THAT CURRENT DEVELOPMENTS, FAR FROM BEING IMCOMPATIBLE WITH THE AIMS OF THE TREATY WHICH UNITES THEM, IMPOSE ON THEM THE OBLIGATION TO MAINTAIN THE MUTUAL LINKS DERIVING FROM THIS TREATY. STATES THAT WISH TO PRESERVE PEACE HAVE NEVER ACHIEVED THIS AIM BY NEGLECTING THE DEMANDS OF THEIR OWN SECURITY.\n3. AT THE SAME TIME, THEY HAVE COME TO REALISE THAT THE CONTEXT OF THEIR COMMON DEFENCE HAS BEEN CONSIDERABLY MODIFIED IN THE LAST TEN YEARS. SINCE IT IS ONLY THEIR STRATEGIC ARMS THAT RENDER THE UNITED STATES AND THE SOVIET UNION MUTUALLY VULNERABLE, THE BALANCE ESTABLISHED IN THIS FIELD BETWEEN THEM GIVES A STRONG ELEMENT OF STABILITY TO THE RLATIONS BETWEEN THESE TWO POWERS. BUT THIS DOES NOT HOLD GOOD FOR EUROPE, WHICH REMAINS PARTICULARLY EXPOSED TO ALL OTHER FORMS OF CONFLICT, SO THAT THE PROBLEM OF EUROPEAN DEFENCE TAKES ON AN INCREASINGLY DISTINCTIVE CHARACTER.\n4. THIS NEW SITUATION HAS BASICALLY PRODUCED NO CHANGE. CONFIDENTIAL  THE MEMBERS OF THE ALLIANCE REAFFIRM THAT THERE IS A PRESENT NO ALTERNATIVE TO THE SECURITY PROVIDED BY THE NUCLEAR FORCES OF THE UNITED STATES, WHETHER BASED IN AMERICA OR EUROPRE.\n5. NEVERTHELESS, THE ALLIANCE MUST NOW PAY MORE CAREFUL ATTENTION TO THE DANGERS TO WHICH IT IS EXPOSED IN THE EUROPEAN REGION, AND MUST ADOPT ALL MEASURES NECESSARY TO AVERT THEM. THE EUUROPEAN MEMBERS, WHO PROVIDE THREE-QUARTERS OF THE CONVENTIONAL FORCES OF THE ALLIANCE IN EUROPE, AND TWO OF WHOM POSSESS NUCLEAR FORCES CAPABLE OF PLAYING A DETERRENT ROLE OF THEIR OWN, UNDERTAKE TO MAKE THE NECESSARY CONTRIBUTION TO MAINTAIN THE COMMON DEFENCE AT A LEVEL CAPABLE OF DETERRING ALL ACTIONS DIRECTED AGAINST THEIR INDEPENDENCE OR TERRITORIAL INTEGRITY AND OF REPELLING ALL AGGRESSION SHOULD DETERRENCE FAIL. THE UNITED STATES FOR ITS PART DECLARES THAT IT WILL NOT TOLERATE ANY SITUATION WHICH WOULD EXPOSE EUROPE TO EXTERNAL POLITICAL OR MILITARY PRESSURE LIKELY TO DEPRIVE IT OF ITS FREEDOM. THE UNITED STATES REAFFIRMS THAT IT WILL MAINTAIN ITS FORCES IN EUROPE AT THE LEVEL REQUIRED TO SUSTAIN THE CREDIBILITY OF THE STRATEGY OF DETERRENCE AND TO MAINTAIN THE CAPACITY TO DEFEND THE NORTH ATLANTIC AREA SHOULD DETERRENCE FAIL; AND THAT THE AIM OF ITS AGREEMENT OF 22ND JUNE, 1973 WITH THE SOVIET UNION IS TO PREVENT WAR IN ALL ITS FORMS, NOT TO LAY DOWN RULES AND LIMITS UNDER WHICH WAR WOULD BE WAGED.\n6. IN THIS CONNECTION, SINCE THE GOAL OF ANY DEFENCE POLICY IS TO FRUSTRATE THE OBJECTIVES WHICH A POTENTIAL ADVERSARY WOULD SEEK TO SECURE BY STARTING A WAR, THE MEMBERS OF THE ALLIANCE AFFIRM THAT ALL THEIR FORCES WOULD IF NECESSARY BE USED FOR THIS PURPOSE.\n7. THE COMMON DEFENCE IS INDEED BINDING UPON ALL AND INDIVISIBLE. THE COMMON AIM IS TO MAINTAIN THE CAPACITY TO PREVENT THE OUTBREAK OF A CONFLICT IN WHICH, THROUGH THE DESTRUCTION OF EUROPES INDEPENDENCE, THE SUBJECTION OF THE  WORLD WOULD BE AT STAKE.\n8. WITH THIS IN VIEW, IT IS RECOGNISED THAT THE CONTINUED PRESENCE OF SUBSTANTIAL AMERICAN FORCES IN EUROPE PLAYS AN INDISPENSABLE ROLE IN THE DEFENCE OF THE UNITED STATES, AS MUCH AS OF THE EUROPEAN COUNTRIES. SIMILARLY, THE PROGRESS OF THE EUROPEAN ECONOMIC COMMUNITY TOWARDS POLITICAL UNION SHOULD, IN DUE COURSE, HAVE BENEFICIAL EFFECTS ON THE DEFENCE CONTRIBUTION OF THOSE OF ITS MEMBER STATES WHO ARE AT THE SAME TIME MEMBERS OF THE ALLIANCE.\n9. THE MEMBERS OF THE ALLIANCE CONSIDER THAT THE WILL TO COMBINE THEIR EFFORTS TO ENSURE THEIR COMMON DEFENCE OBLIGES THEM TO NEGLECT NOTHING WICH MIGHT IMPROVE THE EFFICIENCY OF THEIR CONFIDENTIAL  OWN FORCES, AND THAT EACH COUNTRY SHOULD UNDERTAKE, IN LINE WITH ITS POSITION IN THE ALLIANCE, ITS PROPER SHARE OF THE BURDEN OF MAINTAINING THE SECURITY OF ALL. AT THE SAME TIME, THEY CONSIDER THAT NOTHING SHOULD BE ACCEPTED IN THE CONTEXT OF CURRENT OR FUTURE NEGOTIATIONS WHICH COULD REDUCE THAT SECURITY.\n0. THE MEMBERS OF THE ALLIANCE ARE CONVINCED, NOW AS EVER, THAT THESE AIMS WILL ONLY BE ACHIEVED BY THE MAINTENANCE OF CLOSE CONSULTATION AND CO-OPERATION IN MUTUAL TRUST ON ALL THEIR COMMON PROBLEMS. SINCE DETENTE AND DEFENCE ARE COMPLEMENTARY, THEY WILL IN PARTICULAR KEEP EACH OTHER INFORMED OF DEVELOPMENTS AND PROGRESS IN EAST WEST RELATIONS. FURTHERMORE, WHILE CARRYING OUT THE INDIVIDUAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMMITMENTS THEY HAVE JOINTLY UNDERTAKEN, THEY WILL CONTINUE TO REMOVE SOURCES OF CONFLICT BETWEEN THEIR RESPECTIVE ECONOMIC POLICIES, AND TO ENCOURAGE ECONOMIC CO-OPERATION WITHIN THE ALLIANCE.\n1. THEY RECALL THAT THEIR SOLIDARITY IS BASED ON A COMMON DEDICATION TO THE IDEALS OF DEMOCRACY, RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS, JUSTICE AND SOCIAL PROGRESS, WHICH ARE THE FRUITS OF THEIR SHARED SPIRITUAL HERITAGE. SINCE THESE PRINCIPLES, BY THEIR VERY NATURE, FORBID ANY RECOURSE TO METHODS INCOMPATIBLE WITH THE PROMOTION OF WORLD PEACE, THEY REAFFIRM THAT THE EFFORTS WHICH THEY MAKE TO PRESERVE THEIR INDEPENDENCE, TO MAINTAIN THEIR SECURITY AND TO IMPROVE THE LIVING STANDARDS OF THEIR PEOPLES EXCLUDE ALL FORMS OF AGGRESSION AGAINST ANYONE, ARE NOT DIRECTED AGAINST ANY OTHER COUNTRY, AND ARE DESIGNED TO BRING ABOUT THE GENERAL IMPROVEMENT OF INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS.\n2.

of his old underlying concerns: apprehension about the                        Soviet position in Iraq worry that other Arabs will make separate                        settlements with Israel which leave him out and suspicion that some Arab                        leaders may be working for a separate Palestinian state at his expense He                        said Sadat had told him the US and                        Soviets favored thisan idea of which I immediately disabused himThe King introduced an interesting new concept with regard to the Palestinian                        question instead of an immediate return of the West Bank to Jordan following Israeli withdrawal an                        international presence would be introduced in Gaza and the West Bank A

reintegration into the Hashemite Kingdom I told him that we had always                        envisaged the Palestinians remaining a part of Jordan but said that his                        concept was an interesting one which could be kept in mind as the                        negotiations proceedI briefed the King fully regarding the proposal I negotiated with Sadat on the ceasefire and prisoner

brought up his need for additional                        military assistance I was frank about the Congressional limitations on our                        ability to be helpful but assured him we

SPEAKING BOTH FOR HIMSELF AND SYRIAN PRESIDENT ASSAD IN BAGHDAD, ARAFAT ASKED BAKR AND SADDAM HUSSEIN RETURN IRAQI TROOPS TO SYRIA.

TO REMAIN ALOOF, HE SAID, WOULD LEAVE FILED TO KING HUSSEIN TO DO AS HE PLEASE WITH PALESTINIAN QUESTION. IRAQIS REPLIED THAT ONLY PROPER COURSE WOULD BE FOR FEDAYEEN TO COME TO IRAQ AND CARRY ON STRUGGLE AGAINST ISRAEL FROM THERE.

ARAFAT ALSO TOLD FEISAL THAT CHINESE HAD DELIVERED MORE ARMS AND AMMUNITION TO FEDAYEEN IN RECOG- NITION OF THEIR EFFORTS. ASKED ABOUT HIS TALKS WITH KISSINGER, FEISAL TOLD ARAFAT THAT KISSINGER HAS ASKED HIM LIFT OIL EMBARGO AGAINST US, BUT THAT HE HAD REPLIED THIS WOULD DEPEND ""ON MANY THINGS."" FEISAL QUOTED HIMSELF AS TELLING SECRETARY, ""I CAN NO LONGER DEFEND YOU (AMERICANS) VIS-A-VIS MY OWN FAMILY AND PEOPLE, MUCH LESS ARABS AT LARGE. WE WANT ISRAELI WITH- DRAWAL AND ASSURANCES THAT RIGHTS OF ALESTINIAN PEOPLE WILL BE PROTECTED"".

TENOR OF THIS DISCUSSION LED ARAFAT TO CONCLUDE THAT ""WAR IS NOT OVER"". SINCE HE BELIEVES NEITHER EGYPT NOR SYRIA CAN OR WILL ENDURE PRESENT SITUATION FOR LONG. (ACCORDING TO MATAR, MOST EGYPTIANS ANTICIPATE ANOTHER ""SURPRISE"" FROM SADAT--PROBABLY ANOTHER ROUND OF FIGHTING, BECAUSE SADAT DOES NOT WISH GENEVA PEACE CONFERENCE TO BEGIN IN MID-DECEMBER WITH ISRAELI FORCES STILL ON CANALS WEST BANK.) SHIFTING TO PEACE CONFERENCE, ARAFAT INFORMED SADAT THAT PLO WOULD AGREE TO PARTICIPATE ON CONDITION JORDANIAN QUESTION ""IS SETTLED"". ARAFAT SAID HE HAS GOTTEN IMPRESSION FROM KING DEISAL THAT KING HAD ALREADY MADE UP HIS MIND ON THIS SUBJECT (IN FEDAYEEN FAVOR). SADAT TOLD ARAFAT HE HAD DISCUSSED WITH KISSINGER PROBLEM ODYJORDAN AND QUESTION OF WHO REPRESENTS PALESTINIAN PEOPLE.

war and spoke with some satisfaction of the way he had avoided the twin                        dangers of full involvement on the one hand and isolation through total                        nonparticipation on the other He reflected a basic confidence in his                        position and in the correctness of his policies At the same time he                        reiterated many of his old underlying concerns: apprehension about the                        Soviet position in Iraq worry that other Arabs will make separate                        settlements with Israel which leave him out and suspicion that some Arab                        leaders may be working for a separate Palestinian state at his expense He                        said Sadat had told him the US and                        Soviets favored thisan idea of which I immediately disabused himThe King introduced an interesting new concept with regard to the Palestinian                        question instead of an immediate return of the West Bank to Jordan following Israeli withdrawal an                        international presence would be introduced in Gaza and the West Bank A                        plebisicite would then be held offering the Palestinians there the choice                        between independence federation with Jordan in a United Arab Kingdom or                        reintegration into the Hashemite Kingdom I told him that we had always                        envisaged the Palestinians remaining a part of Jordan but said that his                        concept was an interesting one which could be kept in mind as the                        negotiations proceedI briefed the King fully regarding the proposal I negotiated with Sadat on the ceasefire and prisoner

in some detail our ideas for getting                        a peace conference started under USSoviet auspices in early December I                        assured him that we were not being taken in by

brought up his need for additional                        military assistance I was frank about the Congressional limitations on our                        ability to be helpful but assured him we would do our best I was able to                        convey to him our decision on rapid resupply of his tank losses in the war                        which was helpful but it is clear that he has in mind a more ambitious                        program and more sophisticated equipment than we have provided Jordan so                        far This will be discussed with his military people next

WE ARE PREPARING REPLY TO STATE REFTEL TO BE SENT BY COB TODAY. MEANWHILE, FOLLOWING MAY CLARIFY THE TWO ALLEGED COMMENTS BY EHUTTO WHICH DEPUTY FONMIN WAHIX ABDULLAH CITED AS ""COMPLETELY UNACCEPTABLE"".\n2. BHUTTOS REMARKS ABOUT KING ZAHIR WERE MADE IN COURSE OF SPEECH TO PUBLIC MEETING IN VILLAGE NEAR CHITRAL NOVEMBER 13. NO TRANSCRIPT AVAILABLE SINCE SPEECH WAS EXTEMPORANEOUS (AS, APPARENTLY, WERE ALL BHUTTOS SPEECHES ON NWFP TRIP). ACCORDING GOVERNMENT-CONTROLLED WIRE SERVICE, ASSOCIATED PRESS PAKISTAN, SUBSTANCE HIS REMARKS WERE AS FOLLOWS: PRIMIN SAID IT HAD BEEN SUGGESTED BY ""SOME QUARTERS"" THAT GOP SHOULD WITHOLD CONFIDENTIAL RECOGNITION DAUDS REGIME BECAUSE DAUD HAD STRESSED HIS DISPUTE WITH PAKISTAN IN HIS VERY FIRST SPEECH. ONE SUGGESTION ADVANCED, BHUTTO CONTINUED, WAS THAT HE SHOULD CONTACT KING ZAHIR IN EUROPE, BRING KING TO PESHAWAR, AND SEND HIM ON TOURS OF TRIBAL AREAS. IN SPITE OF ""OUR RESPECT"" FOR KING ZAHIR, BHUTTO SAID, HE HAD MADE IT CLEAR IN RESPONSE THESE SUGGESTIONS THAT PAKISTAN WOULD NOT INDULGE IN POLITICAL CONSPIRACIES AND THAT IT INTENDED ESTABLISH RELATIONS WITH DAUD GOVERNMENT BECAUSE THAT GOVERNMENT WAS NOW IN POWER. IF, HOWEVER, ZAHIR WISHED TO LIVE IN PAKISTAN ""HOW CAN WE REFUSE? WE CANT SAY THAT SINCE HE IS NO LONGER THE KING HE CANNOT LIVE IN PAKISTAN"". QUESTION WAS ON OF HOSPITALITY RATHER THAN POLITICS, BHUTTO ASSERTED. AT SAME TIME, KABUL SHOULD REALIZE THAT IF IT USED PEOPLE AGAINST PAKISTAN, PAKISTAN COULD DO SAME THING TO AFGHANISTAN. IF AFGHANS INTERFERED IN PAKISTANS TRIBAL BELT, PAKISTAN COULD PAY THEM BACK IN SAME COIN.\n3. BHUTTOS REFERENCE TO ""HOT BLOOD"" WAS REPUTEDLY MADE DURING SPEECH IN MOHMAND AGENCY ON NOVEMBER 14 BUT WAS NOT REPORTED IN PRESS AT THAT TIME. ONLY REFERENCE TO THIS STATEMENT APPEARED IN APP REPORT OF PRIMINS SPEECH AT SAMANA ON NOVEMBER 16. ACCORDING APP, BHUTTO IN LATTER SPEECH REFERRED TO HIS EARLIER REMARKS IN MOHMAND AGENCY, SAYING THAT HE HAD NOT MEANT TO ASSERT THAT DAUD AND NAIM WERE ""HOT BLOODED"". WHAT HE HAD ACTUALLY SAID ON THAT OCCASION, BHUTTO CLAIMED, WAS THAT DAUD AND NAIM WERE EXPERIENCED PERSONS WHO AT LEAST UNDERSTOOD INTERNATIONAL POLITICS BUT THAT OTHER MEMBERS OF NEW AFGHAN GOVERNMENT WERE NOT SO EXPERIENCED AND COULD BE ""HOT BLOODED"".\n",1123712

received word here in Peking of the signing of the six point agreement on                            SundayTelegram 3484 from Cairo November                            12 reported that the ceasefire agreement was signed on Sunday                            November 11 under UN auspices Ibid                                RG 59 Central Foreign Policy                            Files and want to congratulate President Sadat and you personally for the                        farsighted statesmanship which made this outcome possibleThe agreement itself is of course of major importance but beyond that I am                        heartened by the determination it reflects on the part of both Egypt and                        Israel To look ahead to the opportunity for negotiations on the broader                        issues between you rather than backward to the sterile debates and bitter                        experiences of the past I am confident the military representatives will                        approach the task of implementing the six point agreement in this same                        spiritThe important thing now is to keep our eyes fixed on the forthcoming                        conference and to avoid anything which could complicate its getting started                        I trust in particular that the immediate questions of the UN checkpoint the unimpeded nonmilitary                        supply of the Third Army the agreed arrangements for Suez and the exchange                        of prisoners can be worked out by the military representatives promptly and                        pragmatically in ways that take account of the essential political and                        military requirements of both sides If this can now be accomplished and as                        the Red Sea blockade ceases to be an issue conditions can be quickly                        created in which a conference can begin unburdened by problems not related to the main                        questions to be negotiatedTelegram 3487 from                            Cairo November 13 transmitted a message from Fahmi to Kissinger complaining that following the signing of the                            sixpoint agreement the Israelis resorted to their usual                            obstructions They had prevented the UNEF from replacing its forces at the checkpoints on the                            CairoSuez road despite several attempts by the UNEF commander to carry out his mandate                                Fahmi pointed out that under                            point 5 of the agreement the UNEF was                            to man the checkpoints and be responsible for inspecting and verifying                            the nonmilitary nature of all supplies sent to the town of Suez                                Fahmi wondered how if the                            situation continued the two sides could discuss anything substantive in                            the proposed peace conference He said that he hoped the Secretary would                            ensure that Israel started to cooperate in good faith on these points

1973Finally it seems to me that the less said about the specifics of a final                        settlement before the conference begins the better since such discussion                        tends to limit later negotiating flexibility on both sides I have in mind                        two things in particularFirst I understand that Dr Zayyat                        has been discussing the elements of an Egyptian plan in certain European                        capitals As I said in my meeting with President SadatSee                                Document 324 the premature                        circulation of peace plans of any kind will make it particularly difficult                        for all of us but especially the United States when negotiations                        beginSecond I am told that the Foreign Ministers of the Organization of African                        Unity plan to meet November 1920 and that there is also talk of a possible                        Arab summit I am concerned that such meetings will take the initiative away                        from the parties to the negotiations and adopt public positions on specific

UNEF:  DEPARTMENT IS SEEKING A LIMITED WAIVER ON RE- QUIREMENT FOR REIMBURSEMENT FOR U.S. AIRLIFT OF UNEF. WAIVER WOULD BE LIMITED TO INITIAL IMMEDIATE EMERGENCY AIRLIFT OF UN PERSONNEL AND SUPPLIES TO ME.       PANAMANIANS HAVE INFORMED US THAT UN HAS ACCEPTED PANAMAS OFFER OF CONTRIBUTION TO UNEF AND THAT PANAMA WAS PUTTING TOGETHER A 392-MAN FORCE WHICH IS EXPECTED TO DEPART ON OR ABOUT NOV. 10.  OUR EMBASSY IS ATTEMPTING TO DETERMINE WHETHER REQUEST FOR U.S. AIRLIFT WILL BE MADE.

ACCORDINGLY, AMBASSADOR SCALI PERSONALLY NOTIFIED UNSYG NOVEMBER 5 THAT IF LATTER EXTENDS INVITATION TO U.S. AND SOVIET GOVERNMENTS, EACH GOVERNMENT WOULD BE WILLING TO COTRIBUTE 36 PERSONNEL TO UNTSO.  SCALI EMPHASIZED THAT THERE SHOULD BE FULL INTEGRATION OF AMERICAN AND SOVIET OBSERVERS IN UNTSO WITH NO SPECIAL PRIVILEGES, AND THAT NEITHER GOVERNMENT IS TO HAVE MORE PERSONNEL  THAN THAT OF ANY GOVERNMENT REPRESENTED IN UNTSO-- (E.E., SWEDEN WHICH NOW HAS 36).  SCALI POINTED OUT SPECIFICALLY TO SOVIET REP MALIK THAT FIGURE OF 36 IS ALL-INCLUSIVE TOTAL APPLYING TO MILITARY MEN, INTER- PRETERS AND/OR ANY OTHER SPECIALISTS.

SYRIA HAS REITERATED THIS THEME USUALLY IN CONTEXT OF NECESSITY FOR USG TO ENSURE EARLY ISRAELI COMPLIANCE WITH THESE RESOLUTIONS SINCE ALL ARAB STATES IMMEDIATELY CONCERNED HAVE ACCEPTED THEM.\n6.  ISRAELI POLITICAL SITUATION:  THERE HAVE BEEN NO PUBLIC STATEMENTS BY ISRAELI OFFICIALS AFTER THE ISRAELI CABINET MEETING DURING THE NIGHT OF NOVEMBER 5.  TERSE COMMUNIQUE ISSUED AFTER THE MEETING, WHICH WAS ALSO ATTENDED BY ISRAELI CHIEF OF STAFF GENERAL ELAZAR, MERELY SAID THAT P.M. MEIR HAD REPORTED ON HER WASHINGTON TALKS.  ISRAELI OFFICIALS WERE ALSO SILENT ABOUT TALKS FOREIGN MINISTER EBAN IS NOW HOLDING IN ROMANIA, AMONG SPECULATION THAT HE MAY HAVE BEEN INVITED TO BUCHAREST FOR CONTACTS WITH A SOVIET OR ARAB EMISSARY.

beginSecond I am told that the Foreign Ministers of the Organization of African                        Unity plan to meet November 1920 and that there is also talk of a possible                        Arab summit I am concerned that such meetings will take the initiative away                        from the parties to the negotiations and adopt public positions on specific                        aspects of a settlement that will make it all the more difficult to explore                        practical ways to make progress in the negotiations themselvesI would welcome your views on these mattersIn                            telegram 3508 from Cairo November 13 Eilts reported that he had delivered the Secretarys                            message to Fahmi who had                            commented that he shared the view expressed in the first four                            paragraphs He noted however that if the Israelis continued to raise                            obstacles he was skeptical that meaningful peace talks could take                            place Fahmi then launched into a                            tirade against Israeli actions of the previous day

BEGIN SUMMARY:  EGYPTIAN FOREIGN MINISTER FAHMI STOPPED OVER IN ROME ENROUTE TO CAIRO NOVEMBER 5.  IN TWO HOUR DISCUSSION WITH ITALIAN FOREIGN MINISTER MORO, FAHMI ESPOUSED FAMILIAR EGYPTIAN POSITION ON OCTOBER 22 CEASEFIRE LINES; WAS HARSHLY CRITICAL OF EUROPEAN POSITION ON MID EAST CRISIS; BRANDISHED OIL WEAPON; AND THREATENED ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL WARFARE IF ISRAELIS REFUSED TO WITHDRAW.  FAHMI REJECTED MOROS COUNTER-ARGUMENTS. ITALIANS WERE JOLTED BY AGGRESSIVE HARSHNESS OF FAHMIS PRESENTATION AND SPECULATE THAT THIS IS INDICATIVE OF NEW, VERY TOUGH EGYPTIAN LINE ON SETTLEMENT.  END SUMMARY.\n2.  EGYPTIAN FOREIGN MINISTER FAHMI TRANSITED ROME NOVEMBER 5 ENROUTE TO CAIRO.  HE HAD TWO HOUR CONVERSATION AT AIRPORT WITH ITALIAN FOREIGN MINISTER MORO.  ON MORNING NOVEMBER 6, FOREIGN MINISTRY SECRETARY GENERAL GAJA, WHO SAT IN ON CONVERSATION, GAVE DCM ACCOUNT OF FAHMI/MORO DISCUSSION.\n3.  GAJA CHARACTERIZED TONE OF DISCUSSION AS UNPLEASANT IN THE EXTREME.  HE SAID FAHMI WAS AGGRESSIVE AND HARSH IN MARKED    SECRET  CONTRAST TO PREVIOUS ITALIAN CONTACTS WITH FORMER EGYPTIAN FOREIGN MINISTERS ZAYYAT AND RIAD.  GAJA SPECULATED THAT FAHMI PERFORMANCE WAS INDICATIVE OF NEW AND VERY TOUGH EGYPTIAN POLICY, AND PERHAPS ALSO OF FAHMIS PERSONAL DRIVING AMBITION.  FURTHER RE ATMOSPHERICS,GAJA SAID FAHMI REFUSED MOROS INVITATION TO LUNCH, ASKING INSTEAD THAT MORO COME TO AIRPORT FOR MEETING WHICH EXTENDED THROUGH LUNCH PERIOD.  (MORO HAD POSTPONED HIS ATTENDANCE AT EC FON MINS CONCLAVE IN BRUSSELS TO MEET WITH EGYPTIAN FONMIN.)\n4.  ACCORDING GAJA, FAHMI TOOK FAMILIAR LINE THAT ISRAELIS MUST RETURN TO OCTOBER 22 CEASE-FIRE LINES BEFORE THERE COULD BE ANY OTHER MOVEMENT ON MID EAST SETTLEMENT.  IN RESPONSE TO MOROS OBSERVATION THAT CEASEFIRE LINES DIFFICULT TO FIX, FAHMI ASSERTED THAT U.S. AND SOVIET SATELLITE RECONNAISSANCE AND MAPS AVAILABLE TO FIELD COMMANDERS ON BOTH SIDES WERE SUFFICIENT TO FIX LINES OF OCTOBER 22.  FAHMI STATED THAT IF THERE ANY DOUBTS ABOUT OCTOBER 22 LINES, EGYPTIANS WILLING TO GIVE ISRAELIS ""FIVE OR TEN KILOMENTERS AS BAKSHEESH"".\n5.  ACCORDING GAJA, MAIN THRUST OF FAHMIS PRESENTATION WAS HARSH CRITICISM OF EUROPEAN, INCLUDING ITALIIAN, POSITION ON MID EAST CRISIS.  FAHMI ASSERTED THAT EUROPEANS HAD SHOWN THAT THERE IS NO RPT NO SUCH THING AS EUROPE, AND THEY HAD DONE NOTHING TO ADVANCE CAUSE OF PEACE.  HE SAID U.S. WEAPONS FOR ISRAEL HAD COME FROM EUROPE, AND NOT ONLY FROM FRG, BUT FROM OTHER COUNTRIES AS WELL.  IN FACT, ACCORDING FAHMI, EGYPTIANS HAD BEEN FIGHTING AGAINST U.S. THROUGH MEDIUM OF ISRAEL.  HE CLAIMED THAT EC DECLARATION HAD BEEN OF NO RPT NO HELP AND WHAT WAS REALLY REQUIRED OF EC WAS DECLARATION DEMANDING ISRAELI WITHDRAWAL TO 1967 LINES.  FAHMI REITERATED THAT EUROPE HAD FAILED AT TIME OF CRISIS TO SHOW UNITY, AND HAD PROVED THAT IT WAS NOT RPT NOT INDEPENDENT.  FURTHER ON MATTERS OF SUBSTANCE, FAHMI SAID THAT BORDERS SHOULD BE ESTABLISHED ON BASIS OF PRINCIPLE ON NON-ACQUISITION OF TERRITORY BY FORCE, AND IN ANY CASE EGYPTS BORDERS WERE LONG ESTABLISHED AND NOT THEREFORE SUBJECT TO NEGOTIATION.  ACCORDING GAJA, RE PALESTINIAN PROBLEM, FAHMI WAS VAGUE AND SAID THIS SHOULD BE SOLVED ""WITHIN CONTEXT OF EXISTENCE OF ISRAEL.""\n6.  MOR RESPONDED THAT PREVIOUSLY ISSUED EC DECLARATION AND    SECRET  SECOND DECLARATION WHICH MAY EMANATE FROM EC FOREIGN MINISTERS MEETING IN BRUSSELS TODAY SHOWED ""SYMPATHY"" FOR ARABS AND CLEARLY INDICATE ""READJUSTMENT"" OF POSITIONS OF SOME EUROPEAN COUNTRIES. MORO SAID ISRAELIS RECOGNIZED PRO-ARAB TILT OF EUROPEANS AND  CITED PRIME MINISTER MEIRS STATEMENT THAT EUROPEANS NOT RPT NOT ACCEPTABLE TO TAKE PART IN ANY MID-EAST PEACE CONFERENCE SINCE THEY CLEARLY PRO-ARAB.  MORO SAID EUROPEAN POSITION BASED ON IMPLEMENTATION OF RESOLUTION 242 WHICH ENCOMPASSES SECURITY FOR ISRAEL AND EXISTENCE OF ISRAEL, NOTING THAT EGYPTIAN POSITION ALSO SUPPORTED THESE POINTS.  RE ITALY, MORO ASSERTED THAT ITALIAN GOVERNMENT HAD PAID POLITICAL PRICE OF ITS PRO-ARAB ATTITUDE IN FACE OF PRO-ISRAELI ELEMENTS IN PARLIAMENT AND  PRO-ISRAELI ITALIAN PUBLIC OPINION.\n7.  FAHMI REJECTED MOROS ARGUMENTATION.  HE CONTENDED THAT EUROPEANS CONTINUE TO PUT PRINCIPAL STRESS ON SECURITY AND GUARANTEES FOR EXISTENCE OF ISRAEL WHILE IGNORING SECURITY AND GUARANTEES FOR BORDERS OF ARABS, WHO IN FACT WERE THE THREATENED PARTY.  HE SAID EUROPEANS SEEM TO HAVE IGNORED FACT OF ISRELI OCCUPATION OF ARAB TERRITORY WHICH PROVED ISRAEL WAS PRINCIPAL DANGER IN AREA.  FAHMI SAID EGYPTIANS ACCEPTED 1967 LINES AS BORDERS OF ISRAEL.  RE PRO-ISRAELI ELEMENTS IN ITALY AND ELSEWHERE, FAHMI SAID IT WAS RESPONSIBILITY OF ITALIAN GOVERNMENT TO EDUCATE THESE ELEMENTS RE REAL FACTS OF SITUATION.  IN CASE OF ITALY SPECIFICALLY, FOR EXAMPLE, PEOPLE SHOULD UNDERSTAND THAT ISRAELI OCCUPATION WAS CAUSE OF SUEZ CANAL CLOSURE WHICH COST ITALIANS DEAR.  FAHMI SAID THAT EUROPEANS WOULD HAVE TO PROVE TO ARABS THAT THEIR POSITION WAS NOT RPT NOT THE SAME AS THAT OF ISRAEL AND IF THEY DID SO ARABS WOULD WELCOME EUROPEAN PARTICIPATION IN MID EAST PEACE CONFERENCE.\n8.  RE U.S. POSITION, MORO DEFENDED IT, EXPLAINING IT WAS BASED ON BALANCE OF POWER FACTORS.  HE SAID U.S. WAS NOT RPT NOT ANTI-ARAB AND ITS ACTIONS WERE TAKEN IN CONTEXT OF EAST-WEST RELATIONSHIPS.  GAJA SAID THAT FAHMI DISMISSED THIS ARGUMENTATION, BUT DID NOT RPT NOT ACCUSE EUROPEANS OF GIVING IN TO U.S. PRESSURE ON MID EAST SITUATION.\n9.  ACCORDING GAJA, FAHMI FREQUENTLY BRANDISHED OIL WEAPON    SECRET  AND ASSERTED ITS USE WAS ""JUST BEGINNING.""  HE DERIDED DUTCH ""CRYING"" OVER OIL EMBARGO, AND SAID OTHER EC COUNTRIES WERE BEING ""CLOSELY WATCHED"" IN THIS REGARD.  RE OIL, GAJA COMMENTED THAT ARABS HAD APPARENTLY GIVEN GUARANTEES TO U.K. AND FRANCE, AND HE WONDERED WHAT BRITISH AND FRENCH HAD DONE TO SECURE  THESE GUARANTEES.  GAJA SAID ALTHOUGH ARABS HAD IMPOSED NO RPT NO ""SANCTIONS"" ON ITALIANS AS YET, NEITHER HAD THEY GIVEN ITALIANS ANY GUARANTEES ABOUT OIL SUPPLY.\n0.  ACCORDING GAJA, FAHMI LAID GREAT STRESS ON ARAB UNITY. FAHMI THREATENED THAT IF ISRAELIS REFUSED TO WITHDRAW, WAS WOULD BE RESUMED AND IT WOULD NOT RPT NOT NECESSARILY BE MILITARY BUT COULD BE ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL.\n1.  CONCLUDING DISCUSSION, GAJA WONDERED WHETHER FAHMI BLAST AT MORO WAS PERHAPS DESIGNED TO PUT PRESSURE ON EC FOREIGN MINISTERS MEETING TODAY IN BRUSSELS.  HE REITERATED THAT FAHMIS HARSH LINE MIGHT BE INDICATIVE OF NEW AND TOUGH EGYPTIAN POSTURE. HE COMMENTED THAT IN ITALIAN VIEW, IF NEGOTIATIONS DO NOT RPT NOT START VERY SOON, SITUATION COULD BECOME VERY DANGEROUS, AND IN THIS CONTEXT HE CITED OIL BLACKMAIL.  GAJA OBSERVED THAT GYRATIONS OF RADICAL ARAB LEADERS SUCH AS BOUMEDIENE AND QADHAFI WERE CERTAINLY UNHELPFUL, AND COULD HAVE EFFECT OF MAKING MODERATES LIKE SADAT AND FEISAL MORE RIGID.  GAJA STATED U.S. PERSPECTIVES ON SITUATION ARE URGENTLY NEEDED. RE LATTER POINT, WE RESPONDED THAT ITALIANS WILL HAVE U.S. VIEWS FIRSTHAND DURING NOVEMBER 12 ROME VISIT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY SISCO.\n2.  MINIMIZE CONSIDERED. VOLPE\n",1113133

QUESTION:  YOU SPELLED OUT DIFFERENCES IN EAST-WEST OPINION. THE EASTERN SUBSTANTIVE CONCEPTS AS CONTAINED IN THEIR OPENING SPEECHES DIFFER FROM THE WEST.  WHY DID YOU STATE THAT WE MADE A ""GOOD START"".  ANSWER:  IT WOULD BE SURPRISING IF OUR PRINCIPLES WERE IN COMPLETE AGREEMENT, FOR IN THAT CASE THERE WOULD BE NO LIMITED OFFICIAL USE\n2.  QUESTION:  DID ANY OF THE EASTERN STATEMENTS SHOW A WILLING- NESS TO REDUCE CONVENTIONAL SUPERIORITY ON THE EASTERN SIDE? ANSWER:  MOST OF THE EASTERN STATEMENTS GENERALLY REFERRED TO BREZHNEVS SPEECH IN MOSCOW WHICH PRESUPPOSES A BALANCE.  I SUP- POSE THAT THE DISPARITY CONCEPT WHICH IS IMPORTANT TO US WILL BE A MAJOR SUBJECT IN FURTHER NEGOTIATIONS.\n3.  QUESTION:  THE NATO STATEMENTS PUT THE FOCUS ON SOVIET AND US FORCES.  DID THE EASTERN STATEMENTS SAY ANYTHING ABOUT THAT? ANSWER:  THE WARSAW PACT VIEW SUGGESTED WE SHOULD CONCENTRATE ON ""NATIONAL AND FOREIGN TROOPS.""  THESE ARE DIFFERING CONCEPTS.\n4.  QUESTION:  WAS THE RUSSIAN SPEECH AS LONG AS THE AMERICAN ONE, AND DID IT DEVIATE FROM OTHER WARSAW PACT SPEECHES?  ANSWER: IT WAS CONSIDERABLE SHORTER THAN THE US SPEECH AND IT QUOTED EX- TENSIVELY FROM BREZHNEV.\n5.  QUESTION:  CAN YOU SAY SOMETHING ABOUT THE COMMON CEILING AND THE CONCEPT OF EQUAL NUMBERS IN REDUCTIONS?  ANSWER:  WHAT WE ARE STRIVING FOR IS APPROXIMATE PARITY OF GROUND PERSONNEL IN THE RE- DUCTION AREA, A COMMON CEILING.  COMMENT:  THIS IS AN AWKWARD FORMULATION AND SHOULD NOT BE USED FURTHER.\n6.  QUESTION:  THE EAST SAID NOTHING ABOUT HUNGARY IN ITS OPENING SPEECHES.  LAST MAY THE HUNGARIAN AMBASSADOR STATED THAT HUNGARY WOULD BECOME A FULL PARTICIPANT ONLY IF ATALY WOULD ALSO BE ONE. THE SOVIET PRESS SAID THE HUNGARIANS WILL NOT BE FULL PARTICI- PANTS.  WHY ARE YOU OPTIMISTIC ON THE HUNGARIAN QUESTION? ANSWER:  IN THE COURSE OF THE PREPARATORY TALKS, IT WAS SAID THAT IF WE DECIDED TO RAISE THE QUESTION OF HUNGARIAN PARTICIPATION THERE WOULD BE NO PROCEDURAL OBJECTION FROM THE OTHER SIDE.  WE WOULD THEREFORE EXPECT A DISCUSSION ON THIS SUBJECT.  THERE IS NO SIMILAR AGREEMENT WITH REGARD TO ITALY.  WE CANNOT NOW ANTICIPATE FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS CONCERNING A DISCUSSION ON HUNGARY.\n7.  QUESTION:  THE WESTERN FOCUS SEEMS ON GROUND TROOPS ONLY.  IS THE AIR FORCE INCLUDED?  ANSWER:  WE DO NOT INTEND TO INCLUDE THE AIR FORCE.  PLANES CAN BE WITHDRAWN AND RETURNED EXTREMELY QUICK- LIMITED OFFICIAL USE\n8.  QUESTION:WHAT IS THE PRECENTAGE OF US GROUND FORCES AND AIR FORCES IN EUROPE,  ANSWER:  I DONT KNOW.\n9.  QUESTION:  DOES THE EASTERN SIDE SHARE THE ALLIED VIEW ON NOT INCLUDING AIR FORCES?  ANSWER:  BREZHNEVS SPEECH QUOTES HIM AS MENTIONING AIR FORCES;  THEREFORE WE PRESUME THIS WILL BE ONE OF THEIR POINTS IN THESE NEGOTIATIONS.\n0.  QUESTION:  AS TO ATOMIC FORCES, WHAT ABOUT BREZHNEVS PRO- POSAL?  ANSWER:  AT THIS STAGE AT LEAST WE DO NOT EXPECT TO IN- CLUDE NECLEAR ARMS.  COMMENT:  AN AWKWARD FORMULATION, NOT FOR FURTHER USE.\n1.  QUESTION:  CAN YOU SAY SOMETHING ABOUT THE PROCEDURE OF FU- TURE MEETINGS.  ANSWER:  IT HAS BEEN AGREED TENTATIVELY THAT THERE WILL BE TWO PLENARY MEETINGS A WEEK.  THE RYTHM COULD SLOW DOWN LATER ON.  IN THE COURSE OF THESE MEETINGS WE INTEND TO UNFORL THE THEMES CONTAINED N THE WESTERN STATEMENTS IN DETAIL.  WE EX- PECT THE OTHER SIDE WILL DO THE SAME CONCERNING THEIR THEMES.\n2.  QUESTION:  WHEN WILL THESE MEETING BE?  ANSWER:  TUESDAYS AND THURSDAYS.\n3.  QUESTION:  CAN YOU SAY SOMETHING ABOUT THE EFFECT OF THE CUR- RUENT REASSESSMENT OF US MILITARY FORCES IN GERMANY ON THE DIS- CUSSIONS?  ANSWER:  THIS HAS NO RELEVANCE TO THE MBFR TALKS.\n4.  QUESTION:  DO COLLATERAL MEASURES INCLUDE PRIOR NOTIFICA- TION OF TROOP MOVEMENTS?  ANSWER:  YES.  THERE ARE ALSO THE QUES- TIONS OF OBSERVERS AND LIMITATION ON LARGE TROOP UNIT MOVEMENTS IN THE REDUCTION AREA.  THE PRUPOSE IS TO GIVE EACH SIDE ADVANCE WARNING TO REMOVE THE RISK OF MISCALCULATION AND THE FEAR OF SUR- PRISE ATTACK AND THUS BRING ABOUT A CHANGE IN PERCEPTION.\n5.  QUESTION:  WHAT IS THE GENERAL POLICY OF THE WESTERN DELEGA- TION ON PRESS BRIEFINGS.  ANSWER:  WE MUST MAINTAIN A CERTAIN DE- GREE OF CONFIDENTIALITY ON THE DETAILS OF THE PROPOSALS ADVANCE TO LIMITED OFFICIAL USE\n6.  QUESTION:  IN REFERENCE TO POINT I (SEE SEPTEL ON QUARLES STATEMENT), WHAT IS MEANT WHEN YOU SPEAK ABOUT THE EUROPEAN COM- MUNITY?  ANSWER:  THIS IS MERELY A WARNING AND THERE IS NOT PRE- CISE CONTEXT TO THAT.  WE ARE NOT SET ON BUILDING A EUROPEAN UNION.  WE DONT YET KNOW MANY OF ITS CONTENTS, PARTICULARLY THE MILITARY ONE WHERE THERE WILL HAVE TO BE FLEXIBILITY WITHIN CEIL- INGS.  WHATEVER MEASURE IS PROPOSED IN THE MEETINGS, WE WILL KEEP IN MIND ITS CONSEQUENCE FOR A EUROPEAN UNION.\n7.  QUESTION:  SOME EAST EUROPEAN SPEAKERS INVITED OTHER IN- TERESTED COUNTRIES TO THE MBFR MEETING.  ANSWER:  WE ARE QUITE AWARE OF THIS INTEREST EVER SINCE THE TALKS STARTED.  THERE IS A WILLINGNESS TO KEEP OTHERS INFORMED AND WE WILL DO SO.  IT IS OUR OPINION THAT THESE NEGOTIATIONS ARE BETWEEN TWO ALLIANCES AND RE- LATED TO THE SPECIFIC AREA OF CENTRAL EUORPE.  IT WOULD NOT BE LIMITED OFFICIAL USE\n8.  QUESTION:  YOU MENTIONED PLENARIES TWICE A WEEK.  HOW ABOUT WORKING GROUPS?  ROMANIA HAS INDICATED THAT IT WANTS TO PARTICI- PATE IN ALL BODIES DURING THE NEGOTIATIONS.  ANSWER:  THE JUNE\n9.  QUESTION:  WHAT WILL BE THE FIRST SUBJECTS AT THE PLENARY? ANSWER:  WE INTEND TO GIVE MORE DETAIL TO WHAT WE MEAN BY THE DIFFERENT CONCEPTS CONTAINED IN THE OPENING STATEMENTS.  WE EX- PECT NO EARLY INTENSIVE DIALOGUES BUT RATHER A FLOW WHICH WILL LEAD TO DIALOGUE AND WILL BE PREPARING THE GROUND FOR CONCRETE PROPOSALS WHICH I CANNOT REVEAL NOW.\n0.  QUESTION:  IS THERE A GUARANTEE THAT AS LONG AS THE MBFR CONFERENCE GOES ON THERE WILL BE NO CONFLICTS BETWEEN THE STATES INVOLVED?  ANSWER:  THE WORD ""GUARANTEE"" GOES QUITE FAR.  WE ARE HERE FOR IMPORTANT NEGOTIATIONS AND SERIOUS DISCUSSION.  THIS WILL HAVE SOME BENEFICIAL INFLUENCE ON OTHER DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE MAJOR POWERS, AND THEY WILL THEREFORE MAKE A MAXIMUM EFFORT AT RESTRAINT.\n1.  QUESTION:  ARE THE TEXTS OF THE STATEMENTS MADE IN THE PLE- NARIES TO BE PUBLISHED?  ANSWER:  CONFERENCE PAPERS ONCE PUT TO THE OTHER SIDE ARE CONFIDENTIAL.  IN OUR BRIEFINGS WE WILL TRY TO OUTLINE THE GENERAL IDEAS.\n2.  QUESTION:  HOW DO YOU PROPOSE TO DISCUSS MUTUAL REDUCTIONS IF ONE PARTNER WANTS TO REDUCE UNILATERALLY?  ANSWER:  I AM NOT AWARE OF ANY PLANNED CHANGE IN US FORCE LEVELS IN EUROPE.\n3.  QUESTION:  I AM REFERRING TO THE SCHLESINGER STATEMENT. ANSWER:  THE PENTAGON REVIEWS THE QUESTION OF US FORCES ALL THE TIME.  THE REDUCTION MEASURES WE ARE TALKING ABOUT HERE ARE CON- CENTRATED ON MBFR.\n4.  QUESTION:  DOES THE NEAR EAST CRISIS HAVE ANY EFFECT ON THE TALKS?  ANSWER:  I AM NOT AWARE OF ANY.\n5.  QUESTION:  DID THE OTHER SIDE CONCEDE THAT DISPARITIES EXIST? ANSWER:  THEY PRESUPPOSE THAT THERE IS AN EXISTING BALANCE OF FORCES.\n6.  QUESTION:  WHAT ABOUT FRENCH PARTICIPATION IN THE TALKS? ANSWER:  THIS IS FOR FRANCE TO DECIDE.  THUS FAR THERE IS NO PAR- TICIPATION.  NO NE ELSE CAN FORCE FRANCE TO PARTICIPATE, BUT IT HAS THE RIGHT TO DO SO.  IF FRANCE SO DECIDES, IT WOULD PLAY AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN THE TALKS.  IT IS ALSO BEING INFORMED ABOUT THEM VIA NATO.\n7.  QUESTION:  THE EAST SAYS THERE IS A BALANCE OF FORCES AND NATO MAINTAINS THAT DISPARITIES EXIST.  ANSWER:  THERE IS DEFIN- ITELY A DISPARITY IN FORCE NUMBERS.  I HAVE NO AUTHENTIC FIGURES, BUT IF YOU USE IISS SOURCES YOU WILL FIND THAT THERE ARE 770,000 NATO FORCES, A FIGURE WHICH IS FAIRLY CORRECT.  AS TO THE WARSAW PACT, IN THE REDUCTION AREA THERE ARE WELL OVER 900,000 MEN. THUS THERE IS A DEFINITE DISPARITY IN NUMBERS.\n8.  QUESTION:  WILL FRENCH FORCES BE COUNTED IN THE REDUCTION? ANSWER:  FRENCH FORCES IN GERMANY ARE COUNTED IN, BUT SINCE FRANCE IS NOT A PARTICIPANT THERE CAN BE NO REQUEST FOR REDUCTION.  OTH- ERS WILL HAVE TO CARRY A BIGGER BURDEN.\n9.  QUESTION:  IS IT THE FIRST AIRM OF THE ALLIES TO GO FOR PARITY AND THEN REDUCTION?  ANSWER:  WE HAVE IN MIND IN THE FIRST PHASE US-SOVIET FORCE REDUCTIONS.  IN A FURTHER PHASE THERE SHOULD BE APPROXIMATELY ROUGH PARITY AT LOWER LEVELS THROUGH REDUC- TIONS.\n0.  QUESTION:  WHICH OTHER WEAPONS DOES THE WEST WANT TO EXCLUDE FROM THE NEGOTIATIONS OTHER THAN AIR FORCES AND NUCLEAR WEAPONS? ANSWER:  WE WANT TO FOCUS ON GROUND ARMIES AND THEIR EQUIPMENT.

QUESTION:  YOU SPELLED OUT DIFFERENCES IN EAST-WEST OPINION. THE EASTERN SUBSTANTIVE CONCEPTS AS CONTAINED IN THEIR OPENING SPEECHES DIFFER FROM THE WEST.  WHY DID YOU STATE THAT WE MADE A ""GOOD START"".  ANSWER:  IT WOULD BE SURPRISING IF OUR PRINCIPLES WERE IN COMPLETE AGREEMENT, FOR IN THAT CASE THERE WOULD BE NO NEED TO HOLD A CONFERENCE.  THE MANNER IN WHICH THE VIEWPOINTS WERE PRESENTED WAS CONSTRUCTIVE.\n2.  QUESTION:  DID ANY OF THE EASTERN STATEMENTS SHOW A WILLING- NESS TO REDUCE CONVENTIONAL SUPERIORITY ON THE EASTERN SIDE?   ANSWER:  MOST OF THE EASTERN STATEMENTS GENERALLY REFERRED TO BREZHNEVS SPEECH IN MOSCOW WHICH PRESUPPOSES A BALANCE.  I SUP- POSE THAT THE DISPARITY CONCEPT WHICH IS IMPORTANT TO US WILL BE A MAJOR SUBJECT IN FURTHER NEGOTIATIONS.\n3.  QUESTION:  THE NATO STATEMENTS PUT THE FOCUS ON SOVIET AND US FORCES.  DID THE EASTERN STATEMENTS SAY ANYTHING ABOUT THAT? ANSWER:  THE WARSAW PACT VIEW SUGGESTED WE SHOULD CONCENTRATE ON ""NATIONAL AND FOREIGN TROOPS.""  THESE ARE DIFFERING CONCEPTS.\n4.  QUESTION:  WAS THE RUSSIAN SPEECH AS LONG AS THE AMERICAN  ONE, AND DID IT DEVIATE FROM OTHER WARSAW PACT SPEECHES?  ANSWER: IT WAS CONSIDERABLE SHORTER THAN THE US SPEECH AND IT QUOTED EX- TENSIVELY FROM BREZHNEV.\n5.  QUESTION:  CAN YOU SAY SOMETHING ABOUT THE COMMON CEILING AND THE CONCEPT OF EQUAL NUMBERS IN REDUCTIONS?  ANSWER:  WHAT WE ARE STRIVING FOR IS APPROXIMATE PARITY OF GROUND PERSONNEL IN THE RE- DUCTION AREA, A COMMON CEILING.  COMMENT:  THIS IS AN AWKWARD  FORMULATION AND SHOULD NOT BE USED FURTHER.\n6.  QUESTION:  THE EAST SAID NOTHING ABOUT HUNGARY IN ITS OPENING SPEECHES.  LAST MAY THE HUNGARIAN AMBASSADOR STATED THAT HUNGARY WOULD BECOME A FULL PARTICIPANT ONLY IF ATALY WOULD ALSO BE ONE. THE SOVIET PRESS SAID THE HUNGARIANS WILL NOT BE FULL PARTICI- PANTS.  WHY ARE YOU OPTIMISTIC ON THE HUNGARIAN QUESTION? ANSWER:  IN THE COURSE OF THE PREPARATORY TALKS, IT WAS SAID THAT IF WE DECIDED TO RAISE THE QUESTION OF HUNGARIAN PARTICIPATION THERE WOULD BE NO PROCEDURAL OBJECTION FROM THE OTHER SIDE.  WE WOULD THEREFORE EXPECT A DISCUSSION ON THIS SUBJECT.  THERE IS NO SIMILAR AGREEMENT WITH REGARD TO ITALY.  WE CANNOT NOW ANTICIPATE FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS CONCERNING A DISCUSSION ON HUNGARY.\n7.  QUESTION:  THE WESTERN FOCUS SEEMS ON GROUND TROOPS ONLY.  IS THE AIR FORCE INCLUDED?  ANSWER:  WE DO NOT INTEND TO INCLUDE THE AIR FORCE.  PLANES CAN BE WITHDRAWN AND RETURNED EXTREMELY QUICK- LY.  THEIR FUNCTIONS ARE DIFFICULT TO ASCERTAIN.  WE CONCENTRATE  ON THE HARD CORE OF THE MILITARY PROBLEM WHICH IS CAUSING TEN- SION, NAMELY THAT OF GROUND FORCES.\n8.  QUESTION:WHAT IS THE PRECENTAGE OF US GROUND FORCES AND AIR FORCES IN EUROPE,  ANSWER:  I DONT KNOW.\n9.  QUESTION:  DOES THE EASTERN SIDE SHARE THE ALLIED VIEW ON NOT INCLUDING AIR FORCES?  ANSWER:  BREZHNEVS SPEECH QUOTES HIM AS MENTIONING AIR FORCES;  THEREFORE WE PRESUME THIS WILL BE ONE OF THEIR POINTS IN THESE NEGOTIATIONS.\n0.  QUESTION:  AS TO ATOMIC FORCES, WHAT ABOUT BREZHNEVS PRO- POSAL?  ANSWER:  AT THIS STAGE AT LEAST WE DO NOT EXPECT TO IN- CLUDE NECLEAR ARMS.  COMMENT:  AN AWKWARD FORMULATION, NOT FOR FURTHER USE.\n1.  QUESTION:  CAN YOU SAY SOMETHING ABOUT THE PROCEDURE OF FU- TURE MEETINGS.  ANSWER:  IT HAS BEEN AGREED TENTATIVELY THAT THERE WILL BE TWO PLENARY MEETINGS A WEEK.  THE RYTHM COULD SLOW DOWN LATER ON.  IN THE COURSE OF THESE MEETINGS WE INTEND TO UNFORL THE THEMES CONTAINED N THE WESTERN STATEMENTS IN DETAIL.  WE EX- PECT THE OTHER SIDE WILL DO THE SAME CONCERNING THEIR THEMES.\n2.  QUESTION:  WHEN WILL THESE MEETING BE?  ANSWER:  TUESDAYS AND THURSDAYS. LIMITED OFFICIAL USE   LIMITED OFFICIAL USE  13.  QUESTION:  CAN YOU SAY SOMETHING ABOUT THE EFFECT OF THE CUR- RUENT REASSESSMENT OF US MILITARY FORCES IN GERMANY ON THE DIS- CUSSIONS?  ANSWER:  THIS HAS NO RELEVANCE TO THE MBFR TALKS.\n4.  QUESTION:  DO COLLATERAL MEASURES INCLUDE PRIOR NOTIFICA- TION OF TROOP MOVEMENTS?  ANSWER:  YES.  THERE ARE ALSO THE QUES- TIONS OF OBSERVERS AND LIMITATION ON LARGE TROOP UNIT MOVEMENTS IN THE REDUCTION AREA.  THE PRUPOSE IS TO GIVE EACH SIDE ADVANCE WARNING TO REMOVE THE RISK OF MISCALCULATION AND THE FEAR OF SUR- PRISE ATTACK AND THUS BRING ABOUT A CHANGE IN PERCEPTION.  \n5.  QUESTION:  WHAT IS THE GENERAL POLICY OF THE WESTERN DELEGA- TION ON PRESS BRIEFINGS.  ANSWER:  WE MUST MAINTAIN A CERTAIN DE- GREE OF CONFIDENTIALITY ON THE DETAILS OF THE PROPOSALS ADVANCE TO THE OTHER SIDE.  HOWEVER, IT IS IMPORTANT THAT THE PRESS BE KEPT INFORMED ON THE MAIN LINES OF THE PROCEDURES.  WE WILL SEE TO IT THAT THIS IS GOING TO BE DONE, BUT THE EXACT FORM HAS NOT BEEN DE- TERMINED.\n6.  QUESTION:  IN REFERENCE TO POINT I (SEE SEPTEL ON QUARLES STATEMENT), WHAT IS MEANT WHEN YOU SPEAK ABOUT THE EUROPEAN COM- MUNITY?  ANSWER:  THIS IS MERELY A WARNING AND THERE IS NOT PRE- CISE CONTEXT TO THAT.  WE ARE NOT SET ON BUILDING A EUROPEAN UNION.  WE DONT YET KNOW MANY OF ITS CONTENTS, PARTICULARLY THE MILITARY ONE WHERE THERE WILL HAVE TO BE FLEXIBILITY WITHIN CEIL- INGS.  WHATEVER MEASURE IS PROPOSED IN THE MEETINGS, WE WILL KEEP IN MIND ITS CONSEQUENCE FOR A EUROPEAN UNION.\n7.  QUESTION:  SOME EAST EUROPEAN SPEAKERS INVITED OTHER IN- TERESTED COUNTRIES TO THE MBFR MEETING.  ANSWER:  WE ARE QUITE AWARE OF THIS INTEREST EVER SINCE THE TALKS STARTED.  THERE IS A WILLINGNESS TO KEEP OTHERS INFORMED AND WE WILL DO SO.  IT IS OUR OPINION THAT THESE NEGOTIATIONS ARE BETWEEN TWO ALLIANCES AND RE- LATED TO THE SPECIFIC AREA OF CENTRAL EUORPE.  IT WOULD NOT BE USEFUL, THEREFORE, TO ADMIT OTHER COUNTRIES.  THE JUNE 28 COM- MUNIQUE AGREED ON THE GENERAL OBJECTIVES AS BEING STRENGTHENING PEACE AND SECURITY IN EUROPE--THAT IS ALL OF EUROPE.  THE NEGO- TIATIONS SHOULD HAVE NO DESTABILIZING EFFECTS ON THE FLANKS AND ON OTHER EUROPEAN COUNTRIES.  BREZHNEV MADE SIMILAR MENTION THAT THE EXISTING BALANCE IN EUROPE AS A WHOLE AND MBFR SHOULD NOT BE LIMITED OFFICIAL USE   LIMITED OFFICIAL USE  ADVERSELY AFFECTED.  WE ARE PREPARED TO KEEP OTHERS FULLY IN- FORMED.\n8.  QUESTION:  YOU MENTIONED PLENARIES TWICE A WEEK.  HOW ABOUT WORKING GROUPS?  ROMANIA HAS INDICATED THAT IT WANTS TO PARTICI- PATE IN ALL BODIES DURING THE NEGOTIATIONS.  ANSWER:  THE JUNE\n9.  QUESTION:  WHAT WILL BE THE FIRST SUBJECTS AT THE PLENARY? ANSWER:  WE INTEND TO GIVE MORE DETAIL TO WHAT WE MEAN BY THE DIFFERENT CONCEPTS CONTAINED IN THE OPENING STATEMENTS.  WE EX- PECT NO EARLY INTENSIVE DIALOGUES BUT RATHER A FLOW WHICH WILL  LEAD TO DIALOGUE AND WILL BE PREPARING THE GROUND FOR CONCRETE PROPOSALS WHICH I CANNOT REVEAL NOW.\n0.  QUESTION:  IS THERE A GUARANTEE THAT AS LONG AS THE MBFR CONFERENCE GOES ON THERE WILL BE NO CONFLICTS BETWEEN THE STATES INVOLVED?  ANSWER:  THE WORD ""GUARANTEE"" GOES QUITE FAR.  WE ARE HERE FOR IMPORTANT NEGOTIATIONS AND SERIOUS DISCUSSION.  THIS WILL HAVE SOME BENEFICIAL INFLUENCE ON OTHER DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE MAJOR POWERS, AND THEY WILL THEREFORE MAKE A MAXIMUM EFFORT AT RESTRAINT.\n1.  QUESTION:  ARE THE TEXTS OF THE STATEMENTS MADE IN THE PLE- NARIES TO BE PUBLISHED?  ANSWER:  CONFERENCE PAPERS ONCE PUT TO THE OTHER SIDE ARE CONFIDENTIAL.  IN OUR BRIEFINGS WE WILL TRY TO OUTLINE THE GENERAL IDEAS.\n2.  QUESTION:  HOW DO YOU PROPOSE TO DISCUSS MUTUAL REDUCTIONS IF ONE PARTNER WANTS TO REDUCE UNILATERALLY?  ANSWER:  I AM NOT AWARE OF ANY PLANNED CHANGE IN US FORCE LEVELS IN EUROPE.\n3.  QUESTION:  I AM REFERRING TO THE SCHLESINGER STATEMENT. ANSWER:  THE PENTAGON REVIEWS THE QUESTION OF US FORCES ALL THE TIME.  THE REDUCTION MEASURES WE ARE TALKING ABOUT HERE ARE CON- CENTRATED ON MBFR.\n4.  QUESTION:  DOES THE NEAR EAST CRISIS HAVE ANY EFFECT ON THE LIMITED OFFICIAL USE   LIMITED OFFICIAL USE  TALKS?  ANSWER:  I AM NOT AWARE OF ANY.\n5.  QUESTION:  DID THE OTHER SIDE CONCEDE THAT DISPARITIES EXIST? ANSWER:  THEY PRESUPPOSE THAT THERE IS AN EXISTING BALANCE OF FORCES.\n6.  QUESTION:  WHAT ABOUT FRENCH PARTICIPATION IN THE TALKS? ANSWER:  THIS IS FOR FRANCE TO DECIDE.  THUS FAR THERE IS NO PAR- TICIPATION. NO ONE ELSE CAN FORCE FRANCE TO PARTICIPATE, BUT IT HAS THE RIGHT TO DO SO.  IF FRANCE SO DECIDES, IT WOULD PLAY AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN THE TALKS.  IT IS ALSO BEING INFORMED ABOUT THEM VIA NATO.\n7.  QUESTION:  THE EAST SAYS THERE IS A BALANCE OF FORCES AND NATO MAINTAINS THAT DISPARITIES EXIST.  ANSWER:  THERE IS DEFIN- ITELY A DISPARITY IN FORCE NUMBERS.  I HAVE NO AUTHENTIC FIGURES, BUT IF YOU USE IISS SOURCES YOU WILL FIND THAT THERE ARE 770,000 NATO FORCES, A FIGURE WHICH IS FAIRLY CORRECT.  AS TO THE WARSAW PACT, IN THE REDUCTION AREA THERE ARE WELL OVER 900,000 MEN. THUS THERE IS A DEFINITE DISPARITY IN NUMBERS.\n8.  QUESTION:  WILL FRENCH FORCES BE COUNTED IN THE REDUCTION? ANSWER:  FRENCH FORCES IN GERMANY ARE COUNTED IN, BUT SINCE FRANCE IS NOT A PARTICIPANT THERE CAN BE NO REQUEST FOR REDUCTION.  OTH- ERS WILL HAVE TO CARRY A BIGGER BURDEN.\n9.  QUESTION:  IS IT THE FIRST AIRM OF THE ALLIES TO GO FOR PARITY AND THEN REDUCTION?  ANSWER:  WE HAVE IN MIND IN THE FIRST PHASE US-SOVIET FORCE REDUCTIONS.  IN A FURTHER PHASE THERE SHOULD BE APPROXIMATELY ROUGH PARITY AT LOWER LEVELS THROUGH REDUC- TIONS.\n0.  QUESTION:  WHICH OTHER WEAPONS DOES THE WEST WANT TO EXCLUDE FROM THE NEGOTIATIONS OTHER THAN AIR FORCES AND NUCLEAR WEAPONS? ANSWER:  WE WANT TO FOCUS ON GROUND ARMIES AND THEIR EQUIPMENT. I CANNOT NOW ENTER ON FULL DETAILS ON FUTURE NEGOTIATING POSITIONS.\n1.  QUESTION:  WOULD THE MILITARY EXPERIENCE OF THE NEAR EAST  WAR HAVE ANY INFLUENCE ON MBFR?  ANSWER:  NO.  THE ATMOSPHERE IS EXCELLENT.  THERE IS NO REFLECTION THERE.  END OF PRESS CONFERENCE. HUMES UNQTE LIMITED OFFICIAL USE   LIMITED OFFICIAL USE  RUSH\n",1112887

SUMMARY:  JUNTA MEMBER MERINO STATES GOC RECOGNIZES IMPORTANCE OF THIS ISSUE, WISHES TO INITIATE TALKS WITH COMPANIES AS SOON AS IT HAS NECESSARY DOCUMENTS IN HAND, IS AWARE OF NEED TO MAINTAIN MAXIMUM FLEXIBILITY AND AVOID COMMITMENT TO A PARTICULAR PROCEDURE WHICH MAY NOT SERVE IN ALL CASES, SEES ADVANTAGES IN PRESSING TO RESOLVE EASIER CASES WHILE GRADUALLY NARROWING DIFFER- ENCES IN OTHERS, AND INTENDS TO KEEP IN TOUCH WITH COMPANIES ONCE PROCESS UNDERWAY.  OUR TALK WAS CORDIAL AND CONSTRUCTIVE THROUGH- OUT.  END SUMMARY.\n2.  2.  ADMIRAL MERINO RECEIVED ME AT 1830 NOVEMBER 9 AT MY REQUEST.  AFTER EXCHANGE OF COURTESIES, I RAISED THIS SUBJECT ALONG LINES PARAGRAPH SEVEN SANTIAGO 5451 AND DREW ON GUIDANCE STATE 216697 AS TALK PROCEEDED.  MERINO REACTED AS FOLLOWS:\n3.  GOC RECOGNIZES IMPORTANCE OF THIS ISSUE AND WANTS TO DEAL WITH IT PROMPTLY.\n4.  UPON RETURN OF FOREIGN MINISTER AND HIS PARTY FROM U.S. VISIT, GOC ORGANIZED RESPONSIBLE GROUP TO DEAL WITH THIS MATTER UNDER LEADERSHIP RAUL SAEZ (MERINO FIRST SAID ORLANDO SAENZ AND THEN CORRECTED).  IT HAS TAKEN GOC LONGER THAN ANTICIPATED TO PREPARE     SECRET  FOR ACTION BECAUSE IT HAS DISCOVERED THAT CERTAIN ESSENTIAL DOCU- MENTS SIMPLY DISAPPEARED WITH THE ALLENDE GOVERNMENT.  EVERY EFFORT IS BEING MADE TO FILL THESE GAPS IN DOCUMENTATION AND HE ANTICI- PATES THAT TALKS WITH THE COMPANIES WILL BE INITIATED WITHIN A FEW WEEKS.  THE GOC IS LOOKING FORWARD TO THE JANUARY PARIS CLUB MEETING AND WANTS TO HAVE THIS PROCESS UNDER WAY IN ADVANCE OF THAT MEETING.  I REMARKED THAT I UNDERSTOOD THE GOC ALSO INTENDED TO HAVE A BILATERAL MEETING WITH US ON DEBT ISSUES IN ADVANCE OF THE PARIS CLUB MEETING AND ASSUMED THE GOC WOULD SEE ADVANTAGES IN HAVING TALKS WITH THE COMPANIES UNDER WAY PRIOR TO THAT MEET- ING.  MERINO ASSENTED.\n5.  THE GOC AGREES THAT IT IS DESIRABLE TO MAINTAIN MAXIMUM FLEXIBILITY SINCE IT IS AWARE THAT THERE ARE IMPORTANT DIFFERENCES IN THE INDIVIDUAL COMPANY CASES AND THE SAME PROCEDURE MAY NOT BE APPLICABLE FOR ALL CASES.\n6.  MERINO SAW ADVANTAGES IN PRESSING TO RESOLVE THE EASIER CASES WHILE GRADUALLY NARROWING DIFFERENCES IN OTHERS.  HE AGREED THAT THE CERRO CASE IS QUITE DIFFERENT FROM THE OTHERS AND THAT ITS EARLY RESOLUTION WOULD BE OF PSYCHOLOGICAL IMPORTANCE.\n7.  MERINO AGREED WITH THE DESIRABILITY OF KEEPING IN TOUCH WITH THE COMPANIES AND INDICATED THIS WOULD BE DONE ONCE TALKS BEGIN.  HOWEVER, HE AGAIN REFERRED TO THE NEED FOR THE GOC TO  FILL IN DOCUMENTATION GAPS BEFORE BEGINNING TALKS.  HE REFERRED TO RAUL SAEZ AS AN ORDERLY MAN WHO WANTS TO BE PROPERLY PREPARED. HE ALSO NOTED THE DISADVANTAGE IN NEGOTIATIONS TO THE SIDE WHICH IS NOT IN POSSESSION OF ALL THE FACTS AND THE GOC DESIRE TO AVOID FALSE STARTS AND BE ABLE TO PROCEED SERIOUSLY WITH THESE TALKS ONCE THEY ARE UNDERTAKEN.  GOC IS AWARE ITS HANDLING OF THIS ISSUE WILL HAVE AN IMPORTANT EFFECT ON INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL AND BUSINESS ATTITUDES TOWARD CHILE.  GOC INTENDS PROCEED PROMPTLY AND SERIOUSLY ON THESE CASES AS IT DOES ON  OTHER U.S. CASES, SUCH AS FORD, WHICH REMAIN OUTSTANDING.\n8.  I TOLD ADMIRAL MERINO I WAS PLEASED TO FIND THAT THE VIEWS OF OUR GOVERNMENTS COINCIDED AND HOPED THAT HE WOULD LET ME KNOW IF HE BELIEVED WE COULD BE HELPFUL.  HE SAID HE WOULD DO SO.\n9.  COMMENT:  OUR TALK WAS ENTIRELY CORDIAL AND MERINOS    SECRET  ATTITUDE WAS REASSURING.  MERINO PLAINLY REGARDS RAUL SAEZ AS IN CHARGE OF THIS SUBJECT AND THAT, AS MUCH AS SUBSTANTIVE DIFFER- ENCES, MAY BE ORLANDO SAENZS PROBLEM -SANTIAGO 5451).  AT THIS TIME MERINOS THINKING SEEMS ENTIRELY IN LINE WITH OUR OWN. I BELIEVE IT WAS USEFUL TO MAKE HIM AWARE OF OUR VIEWS IN THE EVENT HE BEGINS TO RECEIVE PROPOSALS FOR PROCEEDING ALONG DIFFER- ENT LINES.  I HOPE TO FIND AN OPPORTUNITY FOR A MEETING WITH  RAUL SAEZ IN THE NEAR FUTURE AT WHICH I WOULD PROPOSE TO COVER THIS GROUND WITH HIM AS PART OF A BROADER DISCUSSION. THOMPSON\n",1113450

PARTICULARLY WITH RESPECT TO QUESTION CONCERNING POSSIBILITY OF SEVERANCE OF DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS WITH ISRAEL, INSTEAD OF RESPONSE REPORTED REFTEL PARA 3, NIKAIDO WAS AUTHORIZED TO RESPOND THAT QTE IT WOULD NOT BE APPROPRIATE TO COMMENT ABOUT MEASURES WHICH MIGHT BE TAKEN AT SOME FUTURE DATE UNQTE.

agreed in Cairo the disengagement of forces is                        the first question that should be taken up at the peace conference This is                        reflected in the second paragraph of the paper we worked out the morning I                        left CairoSee Document                                330 One of the reasons in fact for having only                        Egypt Syria and Jordan represented in the first stage of the conference was                        because they are the Arab countries whose forces would at some point be                        involved in any disengagement processIt is of course not precluded that the disengagement question could also be                        discussed earlier between the military representatives and I would welcome                        any progress they might make But the US Government will be better able to                        be helpful on the disengagement question in the framework of the conference                        rather than in the more limited context of talks between military representatives at Kilometer 101 where                        we are not direct participants Frankly

little progress in achieving                        disengagement and fail to bring about a conferenceI continue to believe that the primary need now is to focus on organizing the                        conference As I have assured you we will be able to use our influence                        constructively in that framework I was therefore glad to hear from                        Ambassador

SUMMARY:  VINOGRADOV INTERESTED IN CODEL STRATTONS ACTIVITIES AND PURPOSE.  ALSO CLAIMS SADAT DISSATISFIED WITH IMPLEMENTATION ALL ASPECTS 6-POINT AGREEMENT. CONTENDS ISRAELI RETURN TO OCTOBER 22 LINES ESSENTIAL TO ENABLE GOE TO PARTICIPATE IN PEACE CONFERENCE.  USG SHOULD URGE ISRAEL TO BE MORE FLEXIBLE.  I TOLD HIM WHILE EGYPTIANS HAD EXPRESSED CONCERN ABOUT LACK OF PROGRESS ON DISENGAGEMENT, THEY HAD EXPRESSED NO RECENT DISSATISFACTION TO ME ABOUT OTHER POINTS.  I THOUGHT BOTH SIDES INTERESTED IN PEACE CONFERENCE AND USG REMAINS FIRMLY COMMITTED TO SUCH A MEETING AT AN EARLY DATE.  END SUMMARY.\n2.  I CALLED ON VINOGRADOV TODAY FOR AN EXCHANGE OF VIEWS.  AFTER AMENITIES, HE ASKED ABOUT VISITING CODEL STRATTON.  I DESCRIBED CODEL TO HIM, NOTING IT IS A SUB-COMMITTEE FROM THE HOUSE ARMED SERVICES COMMITTEE WHICH IS MAKING FIRST-HAND STUDY OF ISRAELI AND EGYPTIAN VIEWS AND THAT IT IS TODAY VISITING FRONT LINES AS GUEST OF EGYPTIAN MILITARY.  VINOGRADOV WANTED TO KNOW WHAT ATTITUDES MEMBERS OF CODEL ARE TAKING.  TOLD HIM THAT IN MY TALKS WITH ITS MEMBERS, THEY SHOWED EVERY DESIRE TO BE OBJECTIVE AND HEAR BOTH SIDES.  I WAS SURE    SECRET  THEY ARE ATTEMPTING TO DO JUST THAT.  HE CLEARLY RE- TAINED SOME SUSPICIONS WHY SO LARGE A CODEL SHOULD BE VISITING AT THIS TIME AND HALF-JOKINGLY SPECULATED PERHAPS A LARGE MILITARY AID PROGRAM FOR EGYPT WAS CON- TEMPLATED.  I TOLD HIM ONE NEVER KNEW, BUT I THOUGHT THIS UNLIKELY.\n3.  VINOGRADOV THEN ASKED MY IMPRESSIONS OF MY FIRST TWO WEEKS IN CAIRO.  TOLD HIM I HAD BEEN STRUCK BY DISPASSIONATE AND BUSINESSLIKE APPROACH WHICH EGYPTIAN OFFICIALS HAVE SHOWN IN MY DEALINGS WITH THEM. I THOUGHT THEY GENUINELY WANTED PEACE AND WERE WILLING TO PARTICIPATE IN A PEACE CONFERENCE NOW THAT THEY COULD DO SO WITH A SENSE OF PRIDE.  NEITHER SIDE HAD WON AN OVER- WHELMING VICTORY.  BOTH ARE AWARE OF THE ENORMOUS COSTS OF ANOTHER ROUND OF HOSTILITIES.  WHILE SENIOR EGYPTIAN OFFICIALS WITH WHOM I HAD TALKED HAVE CONFIDENCE IN CONTINUING STRENGTH OF THEIR MILITARY, THEY ALSO REALIZE THAT NEGOTIATIONS OFFER A BETTER WAY OF TRYING TO SOLVE LONG-FESTERING ARAB-ISRAELI PROBLEMS THAN DOES WAR.\n4.  VINOGRADOV AGREED BUT PROFESSED TO BE DISTURBED ABOUT WHAT HE CALLED NON-IMPLEMENTATION OF THE SIX- POINT AGREEMENT AND ESPECIALLY ABOUT ISRAELS FAILURE TO RETURN TO THE OCTOBER 22 LINES IN ACCORDANCE WITH PARAGRAPH 2 OF THAT AGREEMENT.  EGYPTIANS, HE CONTENDED, ARE BECOMING INCREASINGLY BITTER ABOUT THIS FAILURE. I RESPONDED THAT MY UNDERSTANDING IS SOMEWHAT DIFFERENT. WHILE THERE HAD BEEN EARLIER EGYPTIAN CONCERN EXPRESSED TO ME THAT THE CURRENT MILITARY RALKS WERE NOT RESOLVING THE UN CHECKPOINT QUESTION, POW RETURN, ETC., NO SUCH COMPLAINTS HAD RECENTLY BEEN MADE.  MY UNDERSTANDING WAS THAT THESE MATTERS HAD NOW BEEN LARGELY RESOLVED IN THE MILITARY TALKS.  THERE HAVE INDEED BEEN A FEW SCATTERED FIREFIGHTS, BUT THESE HAD QUICKLY SUBSIDED. EGYPTIANS HAVE EXPRESSED SOME CONCERN OVER FAILURE TO PROGRESS ON DISENGAGEMENT, BUT I THOUGHT OTHER POINTS WERE BEING REASONABLY WELL IMPLEMENTED.  VINOGRADOV INSISTED THIS IS NOT SO.  SAID HE SAW SADAT ONLY YESTERDAY, WHO HAD EXPRESSED DISSATISFACTION ON IMPLE-    SECRET  MENTATION OF ALL POINTS.  SADAT HAD NOT GONE INTO DETAILS, BUT HAD CRITICIZED ISRAELI BEHAVIOR IN ESTABLISHING UN CHECKPOINTS, THEIR CONTINUING MILITARY BUILDUP, ETC. PRESIDENT HAD BEEN INCENSED ABOUT FAILURE OF ISRAELIS TO WITHDRAW TO THE OCTOBER 22 LINES.  VINOGRADOV TOLD SADAT HE WAS SEEING ME TODAY AND ASKED IF HE MIGHT PASS ON THE PRESIDENTS COMMENT.  SADAT SAID HE COULD DO SO.\n5.  VINOGRADOV THEN MADE LENGTHY PITCH THAT USG SHOULD PRESS ISRAEL TO BE MORE FLEXIBLE.  HE BELITTLED PROGRESS MADE THUS FAR UNDER ""YOUR SIX-POINT AGREEMENT.""  UN CHECKPOINTS WOULD NOT BE NEEDED IF ISRAELIS RETURNED TO OCTOBER 22 LINES.  AS FOR PRISONER EXCHANGE, THIS MAINLY BENEFITED ISRAEL; EGYPT HAD NOT BEEN THAT CON- CERNED ABOUT ANY QUICK REPATRIATION OF ITS POWS.  IS- RAELIS SHOULD ALSO OBSERVE CEASEFIRE MORE SCRUPULOUSLY. IS ISRAEL READY TO ATTEND A PEACE CONFERENCE?  MRS. MEIRS PUBLIC STATEMENTS SUGGESTING IT BE DELAYED UNTIL AFTER ISRAELI ELECTIONS HAVE FURTHER ROILED THE EGYPTIANS. ISRAEL SHOULD NOT TRY TO MIX DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL POLITICS.  BY EMBARRASSING EGYPTIANS BEFORE OTHER ARABS, ISRAELI ACTIONS ARE CREATING PROBLEMS FOR GOE IN ATTENDING CONFERENCE.\n6.  I SAID MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT EGYPT IS JUST AS PLEASED TO HAVE POWS BACK AS IS ISRAEL.  HUMANITARIAN ASPECTS OF SIX POINTS CLEARLY BENEFIT BOTH SIDES.  I\n7.  VINOGRADOV REPLIED AFFIRMATIVELY, BUT STILL EX- PRESSED DOUBT THAT EGYPTIANS CAN GO TO SUCH A CONFERENCE WITHOUT SOME PRIOR PROGRESS ON DISENGAGEMENT.  WHEN I ASKED IF HE THOUGHT EGYPTIAN PARTICIPATION IN A PEACE CONFERENCE IS CONDITIONAL ON THIS, HE BACKED OFF SLIGHTLY. HE SAID HE DID NOT MEAN TO GO THAT FAR, BUT MERELY MEANT TO STRESS THAT EGYPT WOULD FIND IT DIFFICULT BEFORE OTHER ARABS TO ATTEND A PEACE CONFERENCE WHEN THERE HAS BEEN NO PRIOR PROGRESS ON DISENGAGEMENT.  IN THAT CASE CONFERENCE WOULD BE FORCED TO DEVOTE ITS ENERGIES TO THIS CRITICAL POINT.  USG SHOULD URGE ""YOUR CLIENTS""    SECRET  TO BE MORE UNDERSTANDING OF EGYPTIAN POSITION.  I SAID I HAD SEEN PRESS STORIES THAT USSR MIGHT AT SOME TIME RESUME DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS WITH ISRAEL.  IF SO, PERHAPS HE, AS LEADING SOVIET AUTHORITY ON EGYPT, MIGHT THEN BE SENT TO ISRAEL TO EXPLAIN ARAB VIEWPOINT. HE LAUGHED AND SAID NOT LIKELY--ON EITHER COUNT.\n8.  VINOGRADOV SAID USG SHOULD NOT UNDERESTIMATE IM- PORTANCE GOE ATTACHES TO ISRAELS RETURN TO OCTOBER 22 LINES AS AN EARNEST OF SERIOUS INTENT TO HOLD PEACE TALKS.  I SAID USG HAS NO MISCONCEPTION ON THIS POINT, BUT BELIEVES DISENGATEMENT PERHAPS BEST BE APPROACHED IN A BROADER CONTEXT.\n9.  VINOGRADOV NOTED EGYPTIANS SOMETIMES HIDE THEIR TRUE FEELINGS BEHIND EXCESSIVE POLITENESS.  FOR EXAMPLE, SADAT HAD BEEN EXTREMELY POLITE LAST YEAR WHEN ASKING SOVIET MILITARY ADVISORS TO WITHDRAW.  USSR HAD DONE SO QUICKLY AND WITHOUT DEMURRAL.  SOVIET RELA- TIONS WITH EGYPT, HE STRESSED, REMAIN CLOSE AND FRIENDLY AND ARE BASED ON RESPECT FOR EGYPTS INDEPENDENCE.  I SAID I HAD HEARD SOME SOVIET MILITARY ADVISORS MIGHT BE BACK.  HE DENIED THIS, INSISTING ONLY SOVIET ""TECHNICIANS"" WHO HAVE BEEN HERE FOR SOME TIME REMAIN. CLAIMED USSR NOT ANXIOUS HAVE ADVISORS WITH EGYPTIAN ARMY SINCE THEY COULD CBNCEIVABLY BECOME INVOLVED IN COMBAT SITUATIONS.\n0.  WE AGREED KEEP IN TOUCH. EILTS\n",1113290

text:Dear Mr Foreign Minister:Your letter of November 16 conveyed through Ambassador Eilts was awaiting me upon my return I                        very much value the personal relationship we have established and the                        opportunity to stay in close touch with you through our private                        correspondence It gives us the means to anticipate and deal with potential                        problems in a sensible way as we work to solidify the improving relations                        between our two countries I have told you how impressed I was with                        President Sadat and with the                        statesmanlike manner in which he is dealing with the problem of peace in the                        Middle East I believe the relationship between us is one of the reliable                        guarantees that we can faithfully serve our respective Presidents in this                        endeavorI have studied carefully the views set forth in your letter I do not believe                        that the approach you suggest is the most effective for reaching our common                        objectives As I believe we agreed in Cairo the disengagement of forces is                        the first question that should be taken up at the peace conference This is                        reflected in the second paragraph of the paper we worked out the morning I                        left CairoSee Document                                330 One of the reasons in fact for having only                        Egypt Syria and Jordan represented in the first stage of the conference was                        because they are the Arab countries whose forces would at some point be                        involved in any disengagement processIt is of course not precluded that the disengagement question could also be                        discussed earlier between the military representatives and I would welcome                        any progress they might make But the US Government will be better able to                        be helpful on the disengagement question in the framework of the conference                        rather than in the more limited context of talks between military representatives at Kilometer 101 where                        we are not direct participants Frankly I am concerned that pressing the                        disengagement question prematurely or seeking some agreement on it as a                        prerequisite to the conference could result in little progress in achieving                        disengagement and fail to bring about a conferenceI continue to believe that the primary need now is to focus on organizing the                        conference As I have assured you we will be able to use our influence                        constructively in that framework I was therefore glad to hear from                        Ambassador

WE SHARE USINT CAIROS IMPRESSION THAT ISRAELIS HAVE BEEN CONFIDENTIAL  RATHER STICKY IN CILOMETER 101 TALKS ABOUT ALL SUBJECTS OTHER THAN DISENGAGEMENT, BUT THAT ON DISENGAGEMENT, THEY HAVE BEEN EXTRAORDINARILY FORTHCOMING (I.E. ABANDONMENT OF ORIGINAL PLAN OF MUTUAL WITHDRAWAL OF BOTH FORCES TO THEIR OWN SIDE OF CANAL AND CONCESSION OF UNILATERAL WITHDRAWAL TO EAST SIDE AND STATIONING OF EGYPTIAN FORCES ON BOTH SIDES OF CANAL). WITHOUT WANTING TO ASSUME POSE OF ISRAELI ADVOCATE, WE WOULD ONLY NOTE, AS REGARDS ISRALIS STICKINESS ON SUCH THINGS AS MAKING ABSOLUTELY CERTAIN NO MILITARY SUPPLIES ARE SNEAKED TO THIRD EGYPTIAN ARMY, THAT ISRAELIS ARE EVERY BIT AS SUSPICIOUS OF EGYPTIANS AS REFTEL REPORTS EGYPTIANS ARE OF ISRAELIS; ISRAELIS HAVE NEVER FORGOTTEN HOW EGYPTIANS CHEATED ON STANDSTILL- CEASEFIRE AGREEMENT OF AUGUST 1970 BEFORE INK WAS DRY.\n5.

IN DISCUSSION WITH DCM NOV 7, DIRECTOR FONMIN POLITICAL DEPT ISSA AL-HAMAD TOUCHED ON FOLLOWING POINTS:\n2. PRESIDENTS SADAT AND ASSAD ESSENTIALLY CAME TO KUWAIT NPGV 1 FOR BILATERAL MEETING FOLLOWING CEASEFIRE, SINCE KUWAIT PROVIDED SAFE AND RELATIVELY CONVENIENT MEETING PLACE. (EMBASSY HAS REPORT THAT TALKS TOUCHED ON EGYPTIAN ESTIMATES THAT FIGHTING MIGHT WELL BREAK OUT AGAIN AND CONSEQUENT NEED FOR ALL ARAB STATES TO STAND FAST BEHIND ARAB CAUSE, WITH ALL FORCES AND ASSETS IN THEIR POWER FULLY EMPLOYED.) FOLLOWING ASSADS DEPARTURE, SADAT GAVE AMIR AND OTHER GOK REPS FULL BRIEFING ON CEASEFIRE SITUATION, PROBLEMS, ETC.\n3. RE PALESTINIAN ROLE IN PEACE TALKS, AL-HAMAD SAID GOK HAD BEEN HAVING TALKS WITH VARIOUS GROUPS, ENCOURAGING THEM TO TAKE UNIFIED POSITION AND BE IN POSITION TO PLAY ROLE IN UPCOMING PEACE TALKS. AL-HAMAD AGREED PALESTINIANS BADLY SPLIT, BUT FELT EN- COURAGED THAT AT LEAST SOME IN FATAH WERE WILLING TO DISCUSS POSSIBILITY OF PLAYING A ROLE, WHEREAS THEY HAD FLATLY REFUSED CONSIDER THIS IN PAST. GOK PERSUASION APPARENTLY BASED ON IDEA THAT IF EGYPT, SYRIA AND JORDAN MAKE FINAL AGREEMENT RE TERRITORY WITHOUT PALESTINIAN PARTICIPATION, PALESTINIANS WILL BE OUT IN COLD. AL-HAMAD SAID GOK NOT RPT NOT PUSHING ANY PARTICULAR POSITION FOR PALS BUT MERELY TRYING TO GET THEM TOGETHER.\n4. AL-HAMAD SAID MOROCCAN SUGGESTION FOR FOREIGN MINISTERS MEETING NO LONGER UNDER CONSIDERATION SINCE PROPOSAL FOR ARAB SUMMIT MADE BY ALGERIANS. HE SAID THIS WAS PRIMARY CONCERN OF PRESIDENT BOUMEDIENNE WHEN HE VISITED KUWAIT ON NOV 5. BOUMEDIENNE SAID ALGERIA WOULD BE PLEASED TO HOST SUMMIT MEETING, BUT IT WAS NECESSARY THAT MEETING BE WELL PREPARED BEFOREHAND SO THAT ALL PARTICIPATING STATES KNOW PRECISELY WHAT THEY WILL BE TALKING ABOUT AND WHAT OUTCOME IS EXPECTED. PLANS INCLUDE AGREED AGENDA AND FONMIN MEETING IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING SUMMIT. ALGERIANS, KUWAITIS AND APPARENTLY SOME OTHERS WANT TO AVOID LONG-WINDED MEETINGS THAT DO NOT ACCOMPLISH ANYTHING, OR END WITH UNHELPFUL RESULTS. DCM POINTED OUT THAT SUMMIT AT THIS POINT COULD BE MOST UNHELPFUL BY FREEZING ARAB POSITION ON VARIOUS POINTS WHEN FLEXIBILITY WILL BE MOST IMPORTANT TO REACHING ANY SATISFACTORY ACCOMMODATION IN PEACE TALKS. AL-HAMAD SEEMED TO AGREE AND SAID CONFIDENTIAL THAT ALTHOUGH SADAT HAD AGREED IN PRINCIPLE TO SUMMIT MEETING, PLANS WERE SUSPENDED UNTIL AFTER SECRETARYS VISIT TO CAIRO. AL-HAMAD SAID ALL OTHER ARAB STATES WHO MIGHT ATTEND SUMMIT HAD AGREED IN PRINCIPLE, EXCEPT IRAQ. IRAQ HAD TURNED DOWN PROPOSED FOREIGN MINISTERS CONFERENCE, AND MIGHT ALSO NOT RPT NOT ATTEND SUMMIT IF IT IS HELD.\n5. COMMENT: AL-HAMAD WAS OBVIOUSLY STILL OF OPINION HE EXPRESSED REFTEL, I.E. THAT KUWAIT IS LOOKING TO USG TO ""DO SOMETHING"" TO GET ME PEACE MOVES GOING.

JORDANIAN ENVOYS TALHOUNI AND RIFAI MET PRESIDENT FRANGIE NOV 15 TO DISCUSS UPCOMING ALGIERS SUMMIT AND PROBLEM OF PALESTIANIAN PARTICIPATION. WE ARE TOLD BY DIRECTOR GENERAL OF PRESIDENCY (DIB) THAT TALHOUNI STATED CATEGORICALLY JORDAN WOULD PARTICIPATE IN SUMMIT, EVEN THOUGH PLO ALSO EXPECTED BE PRESENT. THIS DIFFERENT FROM KHARTOUM SUMMIT WHERE JORDANIAN DEL REPRESENTED PALESTINIANS, BUT TALHOUNI SAID IT AC- CEPTABLE TO  GOJ.\n2.  CONCERNING FUTURE OF WEST BANK, TALHOUNI TOLD FRANGIE THAT GOJ PLEDGED TO LEIBERATE OCCUPIED TERRITORY BUT THAT DECISION ON FUTURE WOULD BE UP TO PALESTIANIANS. GOJ BELIEVED THAT ALL PALESTINIANS WHO WISHED TO RETURN AFTER TERRITORY LIBERATED SHOULD DO SO AND IT WOULD BE UP TO THEM TO DECIDE WHETHER TERRITORY SHOULD BE INDEPENDENT OR SOMEHOW LINKED TO JORDAN.\n3.  ONLY OTHER POINT MADE BY TALHOUNI ON WHICH DIB REPORTED WAS HIS STATEMENT THAT EAST JERUSALEM SHOULD RE- GAIN ITS ARAB STATUS. LEBANESE REMINDED TALHOUNI THAT CHRISTIANS ALSO HAVE INTERESTS IN JERUSALEM AND ARAB GOVTS WOULD BE WELL ADVISED TAKE THIS INTO CON- SIDERATION. DIB TOLD EMBOFF THAT LEBANESE ENVOY TO VATICAN RAISED FUTURE OF JERUSALEM WITH OFFICIALS THERE ON NOV 12, JUST PRIOR TO SISCOS VISIT. LEBANESE EN- COURAGED AT WHAT THEY WERE TOLD, NAMELY THAT VATICAN WISHES SEE INTERNATIONAL GUARANTEES FOR HOLY PLACES BUT IS NOT PRESSING FOR INTERNATIONALIZATIONOF JERUSALEM, AND THAT VATICAN FEELS STRONGLY THAT THERE MUST BE A HOMELAND FOR THE PALESTINIAN PEOPLE.\n4.  IN RELATED CONVERSATION NOV. 14 LEBANESE FONMIN, TOLD EMBOFF THAT FATAH LEADERS ARE SO KEEN ON PARTICIPATING IN PEACE TALKS THEY HAVE INDICATED TO GOL AND OTHERS THEIR DESIRE TO BE PRESENT AT FIRST STAGE, RATHER THAN LATER STAGE AS EGYPTIANS WERE THINKING. THIS HAS CAUSED EGYPTIAN AMBASSADOR TO EXPRESS CONCERN TO GOL.\n5.  COMMENT:  LEBANESE POSITION ON PARTICIPATION AND REPRESENTATION OF PALESTIANIANS AT PEACE TALKS IS STILL SOMEWHAT FLUID AS THEY CONTINUE TAKE SOUND- INGS WITH OTHER ARAB GOVTS. WHILE THEY THINK ISSUE MOST LIKELY BE RESOLVED BY AGREEMENT THAT PLO SHOULD BE PRESENT IN GENEVA, (BEIRUT 13109) THEY WILL PROBABLY FOLLOW LEAD OF EGYPT AND SAUDI ARABIA WHILE TAKING INTO CAREFUL CONSIDERATION ATTITUDES OF FEDAYEEN (WHO ARE THREAT TO LEBANON) AND JORDAN (WHOM GOL CONSIDERS BE NATURAL ALLY).

 footnote 4 thereto1 Summary: November 18 letter and your November 21                        supplementary message delivered to Fahmy today He reacted negatively                        insisting prior progress on disengagement is necessary if serious problems                        are to be handled at peace conference This need not mean complete                        disengagement but he recalled withdrawal to October 22 lines had been                        called for by Security Council Charging idea of leaving disengagement talks                        for peace conference and delaying conference reflect Israeli wishes he                        complained Egypt being asked to make all the concessions Israel hardly any                        I disputed these assertions emphasized USG                        serious in desiring work for just and durable peace and urged that our best                        judgement on how to proceed be given full weight Fahmy said your proposal                        will be referred to Sadat and formal                        reply will be given in due course This might not be until after Arab                        summit End summary2 I saw Fahmy this morning to deliver your November 18 letter and                        supplementary message of November 21 reftels He had returned last night                        from OAU meeting in Addis In giving him                        the messages I explained that your letter had in fact arrived on the day he                        departed for Addis and regretted that it could not therefore be delivered                        sooner Both messages clearly disturbed him a bit He commented that they                        contained nothing new3 Somewhat irately Fahmy stressed that his earlier letter to you of                        November 16 Cairo 3550See footnote 2 Document 347 did not                        reflect what he called a personal Fahmy view It was rather a formal                            GOE position That letter had been                        dictated on President Sadats                        specific instructions and the President had gone over every word before it                        was approved He contended moreover that his November 16 letter is a                        direct reflection of the earlier understanding which you and he had worked                        out He was concerned that the USG might be                        reneging on this understanding4 The present ceasefire he insisted is fragile and should not be taken                        for granted He quoted you as having told him USG could get October                        22 lines but that it prefers to exert its influence on the bigger issue of                        disengagement This he argued was Mrs Meirs idea GOE should not                        be considered naive Up to now GOE had                        made all the concessions and Israel hardly any The Security Council has                        called upon Israel to return to the October 22 lines These lines are also                        mentioned in the six point agreement as a step toward disengagement5 GOE realizes that military talks cannot                        achieve complete disengagement He insisted however some meaningful progress                        on disengagement is necessary before serious problems can be discussed at                        a peace conference Egypt is not prepared to come to such a conference                        simply to discuss ceasefire lines Even though USG is not a direct participant in the military talks it has                        the influence to help insure there is progress on implementing all the                        points It does not have to wait until a peace conference before it could                        use that influence6 I emphasized to Fahmy that he should have no doubt of high respect that                            USG has for GOE and for him personally I strongly disputed suggestion that                            USG regards Egypt as naive and                        rejected his suggestion USG reneging on its                        understanding with Egypt On contrary our proposal that disengagement talks                        be considered at the peace conference represents a pragmatic approach fully                        consistent with the understanding you and Fahmy had reached earlier He                        could also be assured that you fully appreciate that his letters reflect                            GOE and not simply personal views and                        that they are being treated as such While I was aware of Egyptian concern                        about the October 22 lines there are conflicting views about these lines                        whether one likes it or not This is precisely why the disengagement concept                        was introduced It has the virtue of avoiding small issues when we ought to                        be thinking about broader more important ones7 I continued that it is a fact that USG                        can be more helpful in peace conference forum than as an outside party                        seeking to influence outcome of the military talks I was sure he understood                        this As I had previously assured him you are absolutely serious in wanting                        to move ahead on the problem and your judgment on the best way to proceed                        ought to be given the most careful weight USG is not simply playing the Israeli game in working for a                        conference It is anxious to have a just and durable peace acceptable to all                        parties8 As for the suggested change of date I reminded him that your schedule is                        extremely crowded A peace conference should not be handled hastily and                        needs great care Postponing it to the suggested date will also enable you                        to make another visit to the area Fahmy responded that in his view                        principal aim of your contemplated visit will be work on Damascus not                        Egypt You are of course welcome in Egypt at any time but Egyptian views                        are already known to you I said that another visit to ME prior to the peace conference will                        unquestionably be useful to                        facilitate peace talks I was sure that in coming to the ME again you are as interested in visiting                        Cairo as you were Damascus It will be important to know if Syrians prepared                        to attend conference He recalled he had told you that in the end Syrians                        will attend9 I also reminded him that Egypt has benefited directly from the                        implementation of six point agreement as worked out in the military talks                            POWs are being exchanged Suez is                        being resupplied etc He responded that most of these things could have                        been handled by the Egyptian army and Egypt had no particular reason to                        feel grateful for arrangements which Egypt could have gotten on her own He                        then went into a long account on how Egypt had reluctantly agreed to a                        ceasefire and how the Israeli army moved into the West Bank salient using                        massivelysupplied USG weapons Egypt was                        not prepared have ceasefire work to its disadvantage10 Since we were by then going round and round on the disengagement                        question I asked Fahmy if his comments were the GOE answer to your proposal He backed off a bit and said that                        they are not He will have to discuss the matter with the President in order                        to give a formal reply Such a reply could conceivably be available today                        but he rather suspected it will not be until after the Arab summitIn a November 22 backchannel message to Kissinger Eilts commented that much of Fahmis foul mood during the meeting                            reported in telegram 3611 was clearly prompted by his personal annoyance                            that a direct channel with Ismail had been reestablished and his fear                            that business between their two governments would be conducted behind                            his back Eilts wrote that when                            he had given Fahmi the two                            messages Fahmi had exploded                            because he already knew everything in them from Ismail and showed                                Eilts a copy of Kissingers November 20 letter to                            Ismail Document 349 The Ambassador noted                            that in view of Kissingers                            instructions not to let Sadat or                            Ismail know that he was

necessary before serious problems can be discussed at                        a peace conference Egypt is not prepared to come to such a conference                        simply to discuss ceasefire lines Even though USG is not a direct participant in the military talks it has                        the influence to help insure there is progress on implementing all the                        points It does not have to wait until a peace conference before it could                        use that influence6 I emphasized to Fahmy that he should have no doubt of high respect that                            USG has for GOE and for him personally I strongly disputed suggestion that                            USG regards Egypt as naive and                        rejected his suggestion USG reneging on its                        understanding with Egypt On contrary our proposal that disengagement talks                        be considered at the peace conference represents a pragmatic approach fully                        consistent with the understanding you and Fahmy had reached earlier He                        could also be assured that you fully appreciate that his letters reflect                            GOE and not simply personal views and                        that they are being treated as such While I was aware of Egyptian concern                        about the October 22 lines there are conflicting views about these lines                        whether one likes it or not This is precisely why the disengagement concept                        was introduced It has the virtue of avoiding small issues when we ought to                        be thinking about broader more important ones7 I continued that it is a fact that USG                        can be more helpful in peace conference forum than as an outside party                        seeking to influence outcome of the military talks I was sure he understood                        this As I had previously assured him you are absolutely serious in wanting                        to move ahead on the problem and your judgment on the best way to proceed                        ought to be given the most careful weight USG is not simply playing the Israeli game in working for a                        conference It is anxious to have a just and durable peace acceptable to all                        parties8 As for the suggested change of date I reminded him that your schedule is                        extremely crowded A peace conference should not be handled hastily and                        needs great care Postponing it to the suggested date will also enable you                        to make another visit to the area Fahmy responded that in his view                        principal aim of your contemplated visit will be work on Damascus not                        Egypt You are of course welcome in Egypt at any time but Egyptian views                        are already known to you I said that another visit to ME prior to the peace conference will                        unquestionably be useful to                        facilitate peace talks I was sure that in coming to the ME again you are as interested in visiting                        Cairo as you were Damascus It will be important to know if Syrians prepared                        to attend conference He recalled he had told you that in the end Syrians                        will attend9 I also reminded him that Egypt has benefited directly from the                        implementation of six point agreement as worked out in the military talks                            POWs are being exchanged Suez is                        being resupplied etc He responded that most of these things could have                        been handled by the Egyptian army and Egypt had no particular reason to                        feel grateful for arrangements which Egypt could have gotten on her own He                        then went into a long account on how Egypt had reluctantly agreed to a                        ceasefire and how the Israeli army moved into the West Bank salient using                        massivelysupplied USG weapons Egypt was                        not prepared have ceasefire work to its disadvantage10 Since we were by then going round and round on the disengagement                        question I asked Fahmy if his comments were the GOE answer to your proposal He backed off a bit and said that                        they are not He will have to discuss the matter with the President in order                        to give a formal reply Such a reply could conceivably be available today                        but he rather suspected it will not be until after the Arab summitIn a November 22 backchannel message to Kissinger Eilts commented that much of Fahmis foul mood during the meeting                            reported in telegram 3611 was clearly prompted by his personal annoyance                            that a direct channel with Ismail had been reestablished and his fear                            that business between their two governments would be conducted behind                            his back Eilts wrote that when                            he had given Fahmi the two                            messages Fahmi had exploded                            because he already knew everything in them from Ismail and showed                                Eilts a copy of Kissingers November 20 letter to                            Ismail

progress on disengagement is necessary if serious problems                        are to be handled at peace conference This need not mean complete                        disengagement but he recalled

                       serious in desiring work for just and durable peace and urged that our best                        judgement on how to proceed be given full weight Fahmy said your proposal                        will be referred to Sadat and formal                        reply will be given in due course This might not be until after Arab                        summit End summary2 I saw Fahmy this morning to deliver your November 18 letter and                        supplementary message of November 21 reftels He had returned last night                        from OAU meeting in Addis In giving him                        the messages I explained that your letter had in fact arrived on the day he                        departed for Addis and regretted that it could not therefore be delivered                        sooner Both messages clearly disturbed him a bit He commented that they                        contained nothing new3 Somewhat irately Fahmy stressed that his earlier letter to you of                        November 16 Cairo 3550See footnote 2 Document 347 did not                        reflect what he called a personal Fahmy view It was rather a formal                            GOE position That letter had been                        dictated on President Sadats                        specific instructions and the President had gone over every word before it                        was approved He contended moreover that his November 16 letter is a                        direct reflection of the earlier understanding which you and he had worked                        out He was concerned that the USG might be                        reneging on this understanding4 The present ceasefire he insisted is fragile and should not be taken                        for granted He quoted you as having told him USG could get October                        22 lines but that it prefers to exert its influence on the bigger issue of                        disengagement This he argued was Mrs Meirs idea GOE should not                        be considered naive Up to now GOE had                        made all the concessions and Israel hardly any The Security Council has                        called upon Israel to return to the October 22 lines These lines are also                        mentioned in the six point agreement as a step toward

Fahmy this morning to deliver your November 18 letter and                        supplementary message of November 21 reftels He had returned last night                        from OAU meeting in Addis In giving him                        the messages I explained that your letter had in fact arrived on the day he                        departed for Addis and regretted that it could not therefore be delivered                        sooner Both messages clearly disturbed him a bit He commented that they                        contained nothing new3 Somewhat irately Fahmy stressed that his earlier letter to you of                        November 16 Cairo 3550See footnote 2 Document 347 did not                        reflect what he called a personal Fahmy view It was rather a formal                            GOE position That letter had been                        dictated on President Sadats                        specific instructions and the President had gone over every word before it                        was approved He contended moreover that his November 16 letter is a                        direct reflection of the earlier understanding which you and he had worked                        out He was concerned that the USG might be                        reneging on this understanding4 The present ceasefire he insisted is fragile and should not be taken                        for granted He quoted you as having told him USG could get October                        22 lines but that it prefers to exert its influence on the bigger issue of                        disengagement This he argued was Mrs Meirs idea GOE should not                        be considered naive Up to now GOE had                        made all the concessions and Israel hardly any The Security Council has                        called upon Israel to return to the October 22 lines These lines are also                        mentioned in the six point agreement as a step toward disengagement5 GOE realizes that military talks cannot                        achieve complete disengagement He insisted however some meaningful progress                        on disengagement is necessary before serious problems can be discussed at                        a peace conference Egypt is not prepared to come to such a conference                        simply to discuss ceasefire lines Even though USG is not a direct participant in the military talks it has                        the influence to help insure there is progress on implementing all the                        points It does not have to wait until a peace conference before it could                        use that influence6 I emphasized to Fahmy that he should have no doubt of high respect that                            USG has for GOE and for him personally I strongly disputed suggestion that                            USG regards Egypt as naive and                        rejected his suggestion USG reneging on its                        understanding with Egypt On contrary our proposal that disengagement talks                        be considered at the peace conference represents a pragmatic approach fully                        consistent with the understanding you and Fahmy had reached earlier He                        could also be assured that you fully appreciate that his letters reflect                            GOE and not simply personal views and                        that they are being treated as such While I was aware of Egyptian concern                        about the October 22 lines there are conflicting views about these lines                        whether one likes it or not This is precisely why the disengagement concept                        was introduced It has the virtue of avoiding small issues when we ought to                        be thinking about broader more important ones7 I continued that it is a fact that USG                        can be more helpful in peace conference forum than as an outside party                        seeking to influence outcome of the military talks I was sure he understood                        this As I had previously assured him you are absolutely serious in wanting                        to move ahead on the problem and your judgment on the best way to proceed                        ought to be given the most careful weight USG is not simply playing the Israeli game in working for a                        conference It is anxious to have a just and durable peace acceptable to all                        parties8 As for the suggested change of date I reminded him that your schedule is                        extremely crowded A peace conference should not be handled hastily and                        needs great care Postponing it to the suggested date will also enable you                        to make another visit to the area Fahmy responded that in his view                        principal aim of your contemplated visit will be work on Damascus not                        Egypt You are of course welcome in Egypt at any time but Egyptian views                        are already known to you I said that another visit to ME prior to the peace conference will                        unquestionably be useful to                        facilitate peace talks I was sure that in coming to the ME again you are as interested in visiting                        Cairo as you were Damascus It will be important to know if Syrians prepared                        to attend conference He recalled he had told you that in the end Syrians                        will attend9 I also reminded him that Egypt has benefited directly from the                        implementation of six point agreement as worked out in the military talks                            POWs are being exchanged Suez is                        being resupplied etc He responded that most of these things could have                        been handled by the Egyptian army and Egypt had no particular reason to                        feel grateful for arrangements which Egypt could have gotten on her own He                        then went into a long account on how Egypt had reluctantly agreed to a                        ceasefire and how the Israeli army moved into the West Bank salient using                        massivelysupplied USG weapons Egypt was                        not prepared have ceasefire work to its disadvantage10 Since we were by then going round and round on the disengagement                        question I asked Fahmy if his comments were the GOE answer to your proposal He backed off a bit and said that                        they are not He will have to discuss the matter with the President in order                        to give a formal reply Such a reply could conceivably be available today                        but he rather suspected it will not be until after the Arab summitIn a November 22 backchannel message to Kissinger Eilts commented that much of Fahmis foul mood during the meeting                            reported in telegram 3611 was clearly prompted by his personal annoyance                            that a direct channel with Ismail had been reestablished and his fear                            that business between their two governments would be conducted behind                            his back Eilts wrote that when                            he had given Fahmi the two                            messages Fahmi had exploded                            because he already knew everything in them from Ismail and showed                                Eilts a copy of Kissingers November 20 letter to                            Ismail Document 349 The Ambassador noted                            that in view of Kissingers                            instructions not to let Sadat or                            Ismail know that he was

progress on disengagement is necessary if serious problems                        are to be handled at peace conference This need not mean complete                        disengagement but he recalled withdrawal to October 22 lines had been                        called for by Security Council Charging idea of leaving disengagement talks                        for peace conference and delaying

the President in order                        to give a formal reply Such a reply could conceivably be available today                        but he rather suspected it will not be until after the Arab summitIn a November 22 backchannel message to Kissinger Eilts commented that much of Fahmis foul mood during the meeting                            reported in telegram 3611 was clearly prompted by his personal annoyance                            that a direct channel with Ismail had been reestablished and his fear                            that business between their two governments would be conducted behind                            his back Eilts wrote that when                            he had given Fahmi the two                            messages Fahmi had exploded

PRESIDENT:          YOUR LETTER OF NOVEMBER 3 SETTING FORTH YOUR VIEWS ON THE PRESENT CRISIS IN THE MIDDLE EAST AND THE STEPS TO ACHIEVE A LASTING SOLUTION TO THIS CRISIS HAS BEEN LIMITED OFFICIAL USE   LIMITED OFFICIAL USE  STUDIED CAREFULLY.  BECAUSE OF THE CLOSE PERSONAL RELA- TIONSHIPS YOU HAVE MAINTAINED FOR MANY YEARS WITH THE LEADERS OF SEVERAL IMPORTANT COUNTRIES IN THE MIDDLE EAST AND THE CAREFUL ATTENTION YOU HAVE GIVEN TO DEVELOPMENTS IN THE AREA, YOUR ASSESSMENTS OF THE SITUATION THERE HAVE ALWAYS BEEN OF INTEREST.          AS YOU OBSERVED IN YOUR LETTER, YUGOSLAVIA AND THE US HAVE WIDELY DIVERGENT VIEWS CONCERNING THE ORIGIN AND NATURE OF THE PRESENT CRISIS IN THE MIDDLE EAST.  IN LIGHT OF THESE DIFFERENCES, MR. PRESIDENT, I BELIEVE IT WOULD BE USEFUL FOR ME TO OUTLINE US AIMS SINCE THE   OUTBREAK OF THE RECENT ROUND OF FIGHTING IN THE AREA.          THROUGHOUT THE PRESENT CRISIS THE US HAS DIRECTED ITS EFFORTS TOWARD THE ACHIEVEMENT OF TWO OBJECTIVES: THE CESSATION OF HOSTILITIES AND THE CREATION OF CONDITIONS CONDUCIVE TO PROGRESS THROUGH NEGOTIATIONS TOWARD A JUST AND DURABLE PEACE.  THE US PURSUED THESE OBJECTIVES AT THE UNITED NATIONS AND IN DIPLOMATIC CONSULTATIONS WITH THE PARTIES TO THE CONFLICT, THE PERMANENT MEMBERS OF THE SECURITY COUNCIL, AND OTHER INTERESTED GOVERNMENTS.          IN RECENT DAYS WE HAVE BEEN ENGAGED IN A MAJOR EFFORT TO CONSOLIDATE THE CEASEFIRE SO THAT IT WILL BE POSSIBLE FOR THE PARTIES TO THE CONFLICT TO MOVE ON TOWARDS A MORE PERMANENT PHASE OF NEGOTIATION.  IT WAS IN PURSUIT OF THESE GOALS THAT WE CONSULTED WITH REPRESENTATIVES OF THE GOVERNMENTS OF EGYPT, ISRAEL AND SYRIA IN WASHINGTON LAST WEEK, AND THAT SECRETARY KISSINGER AND HIS PARTY TRAVELED TO SEVERAL ARAB CAPITALS TO ENGAGE IN PERSONAL TALKS WITH ARAB LEADERS.         WE ARE PLEASED THAT AFTER PAINSTAKING US EFFORTS, AN AGREEMENT BETWEEN EGYPT AND ISRAEL HAS BEEN REACHED WHICH CONSTITUTES AN IMPORTANT STEP TOWARD STABILIZATION OF THE CEASEFIRE.  IN THIS AGREEMEN, THE DETAILS OF WHICH ARE FAMILIAR TO YOU, EGYPT AND ISRAEL HAVE AGREED LIMITED OFFICIAL USE   LIMITED OFFICIAL USE  TO TAKE THE FOLLOWING STEPS:  TO OBSERVE SCRUPULOUSLY THE CEASEFIRE CALLED FOR BY THE UNITED NATIONS SECURITY COUNCIL; TO UNDERTAKE DISCUSSIONS IMMEDIATELY TO SETTLE THE QUESTION OF THE RETURN TO THE OCTOBER 22 POSITIONS; TO ASSURE THAT THE TOWN OF SUEZ WILL RECEIVE DAILY SUPPLIES OF FOOD, WATER AND MEDICINE AND THAT ALL WOUNDED CIVILIANS THERE WILL BE EVACUATED; TO PERMIT THE UNIMPEDED MOVEMENT OF NON-MILITARY SUPPLIES TO THE EAST BANK OF THE SUEZ CANAL; TO REPLACE THE ISRAELI CHECKPOINTS ON THE CAIRO-SUEZ ROAD WITH UN CHECKPOINTS, WHILE PERMITTING ISRAELI OFFICERS TO PARTICIPATE WITH UNITED NATIONS PERSONNEL IN THE SUPERVISION AT THE SUEZ END OF THE ROAD AT THE BANK OF THE CANAL OF THE NON- MILITARY NATURE OF THE CARGO; AND TO EXCHANGE ALL PRISONERS OF WAR, INCLUDING WOUNDED, AS SOON AS THE UNITED NATIONS CHECKPOINTS ARE ESTABLISHED ON THE CAIRO-SUEZ ROAD.  ALTHOUGH UNDOUBTEDLY THERE WILL BE   RECURRENT DIFFICULTIES BEFORE THE CEASEFIRE IS FULLY STABILIZED, WE ARE CONFIDENT THAT THESE CAN BE OVERCOME WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF THIS BASIC AGREEMENT.         THE US CONTINUES TO BELIEVE THAT A JUST AND DURABLE PEACE MUST BE BASED ON THE PROVISIONS OF UNITED NATIONS SECURITY COUNCIL RESOLUTION 242 IN ALL ITS PARTS.  WE ARE HOPEFUL THAT THE RECENT CEASEFIRE AGREEMENT WILL LEAD IN THE NEAR FUTURE TO A PROCESS OF NEGOTIATION BETWEEN THE PARTIES UNDER APPROPRIATE AUSPICES.  FOR THESE NEGOTIATIONS TO BE FRUITFUL, A FIRM DEDICATION TO THE NEGOTIATING PROCESS AND A WILLINGNESS ON THE PART OF ALL PARTIES TO SEEK ACCOMMODATIONS ON THE DIFFICULT AND INTRACTABLE ISSUES WHICH HAVE DIVIDED THEM WILL BE REQUIRED.         I AM HOPEFUL, THEREFORE, MR. PRESIDENT, THAT YOU AND YOUR GOVERNMENT WILL JOIN WITH THE US AND OTHER INTERESTED GOVERNMENTS IN ENCOURAGING THE PARTIES CONCERNED TO APPROACH SUCH NEGOTIATIONS IN A SPIRIT OF GOODWILL AND ACCOMMODATION AND TO AVOID ACTIONS ELSEWHERE WHICH WOULD NOT BE CONDUCIVE TO A FAVORABLE LIMITED OFFICIAL USE   LIMITED OFFICIAL USE  NEGOTIATING ATMOSPHERE.

THE FEDERAL MARITIME COMMISSION (FMC) INFORMED HE DEPARTMENT THAT ON NOVEMBER 13 LETTERS WERE SENT TO HILL, BETTS &amp; NASH, 1 WORLD TRADE CENTER, NYC AND TO KURRUS &amp; JACOBI, 2000 K STREET, N.W., WASHINGTON, ATTORNEYS FOR FLOMERCA AND COORDINATED CARIBBEAN TRANSPORT (CCT), RESPECTIVELY, INFORMING THE TWO LINES THROUGH THEIR LEGAL COUNSEL THAT THE FMC IS ASSERTING A PENALTY CLAIM IN THE AMOUNT OF $64,000 AGAINST EACH CARRIER UNDER NEW PROCED- URES ESTABLISHED BY PL 92-416 FOR THEIR HAVING IMPLEMENTED A SHIPPING AGREEMENT IN THE FOREIGN COMMERCE OF THE US (A ROYALTY AGREEMENT OF DECEMBER, 1971) WITHOUT PRIOR FMC APPROVAL, A VIOLATION OF SECTION 15 OF THE SHIPPING ACT, 1916.  PL 92-416 OF AUGUST 29, 1972 AMENDED US SHIP- PING LEGISLATION BY CONVERTING CRIMINAL PENALTIES PRO- VIDED THEREIN TO CIVIL PENALTIES IN CERTAIN INSTANCES (E.G. SECTION 15 VIOLATIONS) AND GIVES THE FMC THE DIS- CONFIDENTIAL  CRETION WHETHER TO ASSERT A CLAIM AND NEGOTIATE A SETTLE- MENT ITSELF OR TO REFER VIOLATION TO THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE (DOJ) FOR PROSECUTION.  PREVIOUSLY, ALL SECTION 15 VIOLATIONS WERE HANDLED BY THE DOJ BECAUSE OF THEIR ANTI- TRUST OR CRIMINAL IMPLICATIONS.  \n2.  EXISTENCE OF THE DECEMBER, 1971 ROYALTY AGREEMENT BETWEEN CCT AND FLOMERCA WAS BROUGHT TO THE ATTENTION OF THE COMMISSION AS A RESULT OF GUATEMALAS A-235 OF DECEMBER 17, 1972.  PARA 2 OF STATE 37059 OF FEBRUARY 29,\n3.  THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT THE LINES WERE AWARE THAT THEIR OPERATION UNDER AN UNAPPROVED ACCORD VIOLATED SECTION 15 AND SUBJECTED THEM TO POSSIBLE CIVIL ACTION AND PENALTIES SINCE THE MATTER HAD BEEN INFORMALLY DIS- CUSSED BY THE FMC AND THE LINES LEGAL REPRESENTATIVES FOLLOWING THE FILING OF THE AGREEMENT LAST MARCH.  WHAT HAS BEEN IN DOUBT HAS BEEN THE AMOUNT TO BE CLAIMED. ACCORDING TO THE FMC, IT DETERMINED THAT THE LINES WERE IN VIOLATION OF SECTION 15 FOR 342 DAYS DURING WHICH TIME 64 VOYAGES WERE MADE.  THE AMOUNTS CLAIMED ARE BASED ON THE NUMBER OF VOYAGES MADE FROM THE DATE OF THE ENACTMENT OF PL 92-416 ($1,000 FOR EACH ONE), BUT COULD HAVE CONCEIVABLY AMOUNTED TO A LARGER SUM HAD CONFIDENTIAL  THE CALCULATIONS REFLECTED THE VOYAGES MADE SINCE DECEM- BER, 1971 (THE DATE THE AGREEMENT WAS ENTERED INTO) OR AT THE MAXIMUM PENALTY RATE OF $1,000 DAILY ALLOWABLE UNDER SECTION 15 FOR EACH DAY A CARRIER IS FOUND TO BE IN VIOLATION OF THE SECTION.  \n4.  THE NEXT STEP WILL BE FOR THE FMC AND THE LINES LEGAL COUNSELS TO NEGOTIATE AN ACCEPTABLE SETTLEMENT. THE LINES ARE NOT OBLIGATED TO NEGOTIATE OR SETTLE WITH THE FMC.  HOWEVER, FAILURE TO DO SO WILL RESULT IN THE MATTER BEING REFERRED TO THE DOJ FOR PROSECUTION AND COULD INVOLVE A MUCH LARGER FINE.  THEREAFTER, REFUSAL TO PAY ANY FINE SET BY THE COURT WOULD LEAVE THE DOJ   NO ALTERNATIVE BUT TO OBTAIN A COURT ORDER TO ATTACH PROPERTY OF THE LINES FOUND WITHIN THE JURISDICTION OF THE UNITED STATES (E.G. A VESSEL).  \n5.  THE LETTERS SHOULD ARRIVE AT THE ATTORNEYS OFFICES TODAY OR TOMORROW.  THE DEPARTMENT IS CONCERNED THAT ONCE NOTIFIED OF THE CLAIM   , FLOMERCA AND THE GOG MAY INTERPRET THE FMC DETERMINATION AS A USG EFFORT TO PRESSURE FLOMERCA ON THE CURRENT SHIPPING PROBLEM WITH DELTA LINES.  THIS, IN TURN, PARTICULARLY AGAINST THE BACKGROUND OF SIMULTANEOUS EVENTS OF WHICH THE EMBASSY IS AWARE, COULD GIVE RISE TO AN EMOTIONAL RESPONSE. ACCORDINGLY, DRAWING ON THE FOREGOING, THE EMBASSY, AT ITS DISCRETION, MAY WISH TO DISCUSS THE FMC CLAIM WITH APPROPRIATE GOG AND FLOMERCA OFFICIALS IN AN EFFORT TO DISPEL ANY MISUNDERSTANDING ON THIS MATTER.  IN ANY DISCUSSIONS YOU SHOULD STRESS THE POINT HAT THE FMC NOTIFICATION HAS NO CONNECTION WITH THE ISSUE PENDING BETWEEN DELTA AND FLOMERCA, BUT RATHER IS THE OUTCOME OF A PROCEDURE OF WHICH FLOMERCA HAS LONG BEEN AWARE. YOU MIGHT ALSO WISH TO INDICATE THIS IS A CLAIM, AND NOT A FINDING.  YOU MAY POINT OUT THAT THE VIOLATION CAME TO THE ATTENTION OF THE FMC IN JANUARY, 1973 AND HAS BEEN UNDER ACTIVE CONSIDERATION SINCE THAT TIME. MOREOVER, WE ASSUME THAT BOTH CCT AND FLOMERCA WERE CONFIDENTIAL  AWARE OF THIS BECAUSE OF THE INFORMAL FMC DISCUSSIONS THAT HAVE TAKEN PLACE WITH THEIR ATTORNEYS.  YOU MAY ALSO STRESS THAT THE NEW PROCEDURES FOR HANDLING SECTION 15 VIOLATIONS ES ABLISHED BY PL 92-416 ARE MORE FLEXIBLE IN THAT THEY ENABLE THE FMC AND THE PARTIES FOUND TO BE IN VIOLATION OF THE SECTION TO NEGOTIATE AN OUT-OF-COURT SETTLEMENT.  PREVIOUSLY, SECTION 15 VIOLA- TIONS WERE REFERRED DIRECTLY TO THE DOJ IN THE FIRST INSTANCE.  IF NECESSARY, YOU SHOULD INDICATE THAT THIS IS NOT THE FIRST TIME FLOMERCA HAS BEEN FOUND IN VIOLA- TION OF SECTION 15.  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS WERE BROUGHT AGAINST FLOMERCA AND JAN C. UITERWYK BY THE DOJ IN 1968 FOR OPERATING UNDER A SHIPPING AGREEMENT WHICH WAS NEVER SUBMITTED TO THE FMC FOR APPROVAL AND FOR CARRY- ING CARGO AT TARIFF RATES LOWER THAN THOSE ON FILE WITH THE FMC.  THE TWO LINES WERE FINED $5,000 EACH UNDER A CONSENT DECREE WORKED OUT BETWEEN DOT AND THE LINES REPRESENTATIVES.  \n6.  PLEASE ADVISE US OF ANY REACTION BY GOG OR FLOMERCA.   RUSH\n",1112683

      Kilometer 101 talks to transfer further discussion of disengagement issue to                        JanuaryFebruary sessions of Geneva peace conference Eban said he assumed formal invitation to                        peace conference when it came would through either its listing of                        participants or its description of conference purposes preclude fedayeen                        participation Eban said Secretary                        had given him very strong assurances that US could induce Egypt and                            USSR to agree on maintenance of                        ceasefire and on nonresort to UN Security                        Council during interim between now and opening of peace conference Israel                        meanwhile would try to keep Kilometer 101 talks alive by discussing subjects                        other than disengagement and would not take initiative of breaking off talksIn telegram 3368 from Cairo November 27 Eilts reported Egyptian perceptions                            that while Israeli negotiators at KM 101                            could not be accused of bad faith during the discussions since November                            11 implementation of the ceasefire accord had been marked by Israeli                            delays Ibid Box 639 Country Files Middle East Arab Republic of                            Egypt Vol X Nov 73Dec 31 1973 Although he did not read me                        text of formal GOI reply to US which he                        said Dinitz would convey he                        indicated reply called for Syria to start adhering to Geneva Convention on                        POWs if Syria was interested in attending peace conferenceIn telegram 9543 from Tel Aviv November 27 Keating reported that in his                            conversation with Eban the                            Foreign Minister had been most interested in the modalities of convening                            the Geneva peace conference He had reiterated the Israeli Government                            position that it would not sit down to negotiate with Syria until the                            Syrians started complying with the Geneva Convention on POWs He also                            reaffirmed the Israeli position against negotiations with Arafat and those murderers in Beirut

to get Soviets to push for POW exchange and that Israeli public opinion would require                            POW exchange before Israel could                        negotiate with Syria Eban added that                            GOI was expecting Secretary to visit                        Israel December 16 following visits to Arab capitals including Damascus                        End summary2 Eban invited me to Jerusalem                        evening of November 26 for briefing on latest Middle East settlement                        developments Also present were Assistant DirGen MFA Evron North                        American Director Elizur DCM and PolOffSmith3 Eban said Secretary had been                        interested in two things during their conversations last week:See footnote 4 Document                                350 a formal GOI                        decision to accept procedures for Middle East peace conference and b                        Israeli agreement to transfer question of disengagement of forces from                        Kilometer 101 talks to peace conference Secretarys proposal re peace                        conference involved date venue and levels Eban learned that US proposal had been discussed with                        various governments concerned and that Israeli amendments could mean                        undesirable delays in getting conference started Secretary had impressed on                            Eban that chief thing was opening                        date importance of which Israelis had not realized Secretary had said date                        of opening could have positive effect on ceasefire in Middle East and on                        easing energy crisis Creation of fact of conference would have important                        psychological effect across the board whereas any postponement would arouse                        great suspicion4 Eban said that when all this was                        explained to Israeli Cabinet November 25 GOI had decided to accept proposal GOI reply to USG was now being                        delivered in Washington by Israeli Ambassador GOI reply among other things noted expectation that if Syria                        were to attend the conference Syria first would have to commence                        observation of Geneva Convention                        concerning POWs Eban continued only                        thing Israel now awaited was to learn exact terms in which formal invitation                        to peace conference would be couched Eban presumed invitation would be based on Resolution 338                        would state who the participants were to be and would indicate that purpose                        of conference is negotiations and agreement with Israel Even if Arafat wanted to wreck conference                            Eban doubted he would be willing                        to come to conference purpose of which contradicted the very reason for                        existence of fedayeen organizations Eban hoped list of participants in invitation would be as it                        had been outlined to Eban in                        Washington5 Eban turned to what he described as                        Secretarys second request of Israel: agreement to transfer discussion of                        disengagement issue from Kilometer 101 talks to Geneva Eban said this was more of a problem for                        Israel Israelis had thought it would be good to have stabilization of                        ceasefire in effect before peace conference Secretary believed this could                        be handled at Geneva and that US could assure Israel that Egyptians and                        Soviets would not during interim resume fire or rush off to UN Security Council He had told Eban that US could hold the line6 Eban said he still had not received                        report on outcome of November 26 meeting at Kilometer 101 In November 24                        meeting at Kilometer 101 it looked as though Secretarys prediction that                        Israel would not be able to achieve agreement on disengagement through these                        talks was coming trueSee footnote 2 Document 358Eban noted his understanding was                        disengagement issue would be covered in JanuaryFebruary sessions of peace                        conference rather than at opening meeting7 At this point I asked Eban if his                        understanding was that opening meeting on December 18 would be purely                        formal and he said yes Eban added                        that although opening session would not bring substantive progress choice                        of date would help situation as there would not be long wait Symbolism of                        opening session would in itself be very important8 I asked Eban if he did not consider                        fact of ongoing talks at Kilometer 101 was in itself a breakthrough                            Eban said this was true However                        these talks were less difficult for Egyptians than peace conference because                        Egyptians could answer critics of Kilometer 101 meetings by pointing out                        that Egypt met with Israel previously on military level under terms of 1949                        Armistice Agreement Now that opportunity existed to commence actual peace                        conference Israel had to seize it as it might be fleeting As for                        nonsubstantive nature of opening session Foreign Ministers would be                        present from Arab countries Israel US and USSR and UN Secretary General                        would also be present meaning there would be sufficient number of general statements to last a couple of                        days9 I asked how Israel at opening session would be able to schedule next                        meeting of conference in January when Israelis would not know how long it                        would take them to form new government Eban replied if party composition of new Israeli Government                        would be the same as present one which he expected formation should not                        take too long I then asked specifically if Israel would be prepared at                        December 18 session to set date for next meeting Eban said yes and suggested Israelis in                        setting date could note in passing their assumption that next GOI would have same composition Even if                        things turned out differently and formation of government took longer than                        expected it would be wise at December 18 meeting to set date in January and                        then later if necessary request postponement of a few days10 I asked Eban if he was concerned                        about reported Soviet efforts to assist in forming Palestinian government in                        exile and how he related this to general picture Eban said he was quite concerned about this                        Soviet activity He said he did not know what exactly Soviets were trying to                        do This development made it all the more important to Israel to receive                        list of participants in peace conference In Israels oral exchange on                        subject with us all that had been specified was that conference should                        begin on December 18 in Geneva commencing at Foreign Minister level with                        countries which took part in October war plus UN Secretary General He added conference at later time could                        be expanded to include all belligerents of 1967 and 1973 wars I noted US                        was aware that Israel would not want to sit down with Arafat and others like him and I had                        reported this feeling to Washington as conveyed to me by Prime Minister                            Eban said that even if one set                        aside Jordanian positin on this issue Israel would have great difficulty                        with it It therefore was important that invitation state purposes of peace                        conference Eban continued he had                        told Secretary that if King Hussein                        were to include Palestinians in his delegation that would be another                        matter These could include West Bank Arabs who are King Husseins citizens and who reside in what                        formerly was Palestine but not people who live in Beirut11 Eban then turned to Secretarys                        assurances that transfer of disengagement discussions to Geneva could be                        arranged without danger that Soviets or Egyptians would take matter to                            UN Security Council Eban replied Secretary had assured him                        Egypt and USSR would agree to postpone                        further litigation over disengagement issue Secretary had also told                            Eban he believed Egypt would                        respect ceasefire Eban said he was                        glad to have very strong US assurances that neither political nor                        military action would be taken between now and peace conference I asked Eban if his feeling of confidence extended also to Syria                        and Eban merely replied that Syrians                        were a problem12 I asked Eban if Egyptians had                        given Israel a position on disengagement in Kilometer 101 talks on                        takeitorleaveitbasis which was unacceptable to Israel or whether                        Egyptians in Israeli view were trying to maneuver situation so that Israel                        could be accused of breaking off these talks If so it occurred to me there                        were many other topics Israel could discuss to keep talks going Eban said that in GOIs formal reply to us concerning opening of peace                        conference GOI had specified that Israelis                        would not take initiative of breaking off Kilometer 101 talks and in fact                        would try to keep talks alive Yariv had been instructed that if no                        progress on disengagement was evident in his forum he was to agree to                        transfer of this issue to Geneva Eban said Yariv was instructed to say GOI could not accept proposal made by GOE November 24At the November 22 meeting at KM 101                            General Gamasy proposed an                            initial and temporary disengagement and separation of forces                            Telegram 5040 from USUN November 23                            National Archives RG 59 Central                            Foreign Policy Files He clarified his proposal at the November 23                            meeting Telegram 5074 from USUN                            November 24 ibid he doubted Egyptians would be offering new                        concessions although he said he would inform me promptly if anything of                        substance happened at Nov 26 meeting at KM                        101 Press this morning reports no progress was madeIn telegram 5114 from USUN November 27 Bennett reported on the November 26 KM 101 meeting during which Yaariv turned down Gamasys earlier disengagement                            proposal and said Israel could not accept Gamasys proposed force level for Egyptian forces on the                            East Bank suggesting these be reduced to a token level It was agreed                            that Yaariv would go back for                            more instructions and would propose lines for Israeli forces beyond the                            main force Gamasy would then                            reconsider the question of Egyptian strength east of the canal but he                            made it clear that Egypt would accept no limitations on Egyptian                            strength west of the canal Bennett noted that it seemed that the Israelis were                            holding out the promise of considerable concessions but were unwilling                            to be pinned down until the elections andor peace talks Ibid                                Nixon Presidential                            Materials NSC Files Box

December 5 1973 2 of 313 I asked Eban for his view of how                        Arab summit would affect climate between now and peace conf Eban said Secretary had been aware of                        forthcoming Arab summit when he assured Eban Egyptians and Soviets would not disrupt ceasefire or                        resort to UN Security Council during interim                        before peace conf At the same time Eban said he was concerned about                        Egyptian public statements which were threatening and about fact Syria also                        issuing such statements He felt that Israel would have to consider                        atmosphere and rhetoric in area before and during conf although it was                        better not to raise this subject before Arab summit14 In context of discussing importance of creating conducive atmosphere                        before peace conf Eban again turned                        to issue of Israeli POWs in Syria Eban saw no solution but to go on putting pressures on Syria in various ways especially                        through Soviets Secretary had been unable to confirm by time of Ebans departure from US whether Syria                        would come to peace conf or not Secretary had talked late last week with                        Syrian Rep at UN who only said he would                        report US concern about POW issue to                            DamascusSee Document                                350Waldheim had told Eban that Syrian official who had made                        original more flexible proposal for POW                        exchange from which Syria had subsequently backed off had now been shunted                        off to Bonn Nevertheless if Syria really were interested in coming to                        peace conf this in Ebans opinion                        would create some leverage on POW issue It                        was known fact that Israeli public opinion would not allow peace                        negotiations with Syria without POW                        exchange first Any Syrian expression of interest in peace conf Eban said would give us excellent                        opportunity to speak to Soviets about need for POW exchange15 At end of meeting Eban said GOI was looking forward to Secretarys arrival                        in Israel Dec 16 after which Secretary would go to Geneva He added he                        understood Secretary would first visit Arab capitals which he did not cover                        on his Mid East trip and that this would include DamascusKeating,frus1969-76v25d361,"1.  FOLLOWING IS EMBASSY SUMMARY OF OFFICIAL TEXT OF FONMIN EBANS SPEECH NOVEMBER 27 TO CONFERENCE OF PRESIDENTS OF AMERICAN JEWISH ORGANIZATIOONS. (FULL TEXT HAS BEEN POUCHED NOVEMBER 28).\n2.  EBAN AID THAT ISRAEL MUST UNDERTAKE FAR-REACHING CONCEP- TUAL REASSESSMENT,  PARADOX IS THAT AGONIZED NATIONAL DEBATE GOES FORWARD WITHIN OBJECTIVE REALITY OF TRIUMPH. ISRAEL HAS NOT BEEN DEFEATED OR CONQUERED, NON-COMBATANT POPULATION WAS SPARED WORST OF WAR, AND ARAB ATTACKS DID NOT ACHIEVE THEIR MILITARY AIMS.\n3.  YET THIS IS A VICTORY WITHOUT CELEBRATION. PERILS OF FIRST WEEK OF WAR ARE JUST AS MUCH A POLITICAL REALITY AS TRIUMPH OF SUBSEQUENT DAYS. THIS HAS MODIFIED STANDARDS BY WHICH WORLD APPRAISES ISRAELIS AND ARABS, AND BY WHICH WE APPRAISE EACH OTHER. QUOTE. IT APPEARS THAT THE UNIQUELY CRUSHING UNCLASSIFIED EXTENT OF OUR 1967 TRIUMPH--A HUNDRED PERCENT ISRAELI VICTORY AND A HUNDRED PERCENT ARAB DEFEAT--WAS NOT AN AUTHENTIC OR PERMANENT REFLECTION OF THE REAL MILITARY BALANCE. END QUOTE\n4.  EBAN SAID THAT ISRAELS NATIONAL SECURITY DOCTRINE SINCE\n5. QUOTE. . . THE TRUTH IS THAT EVEN OUR PRE-WAR POLICIES WERE SOMETIMES UNDERMINED BY BEING TAKEN OUT OF THEIR OWN BALANCE AND PROPORTION. A DOCTRINE BASED ON ABSOLUTE CONFI- DENCE CAUSED NATIONAL STYLE AND RHETORIC TO BECOME OVERLY STRIDENT. DOMESTIC RIVALRIES LED TO PROLIFERATION OF MAXIMALIST STATEMENTS. ISRAELS RIGHT AND CLAIMS, LEGITIMATE IN THEMSELVES, WERE OFTEN PROCLAIMED IN A VACUUM, . . . END QUOTE.\n6.  EBAN SAID THAT OCTOBER EXPERIENCE REINFORCES PRINCIPLE THAT BORDERS MUST ENABLE ISRAEL TO WITHSTAND FIRST MOMENTUM OF AN ASSAULT. QUOTE. . .

              had now acceded to two US requests conveyed through him to attend peace                        conference opening December 18 in Geneva and to agree with Egyptians in                        Kilometer 101 talks to transfer further discussion of disengagement issue to                        JanuaryFebruary sessions of Geneva peace conference Eban said he assumed formal invitation to                        peace conference when it came would through either its listing of                        participants or its description of conference purposes preclude fedayeen                        participation Eban said Secretary                        had given him very strong assurances that US could induce Egypt and                            USSR to agree on maintenance of                        ceasefire and on nonresort to UN Security                        Council during interim between now and opening of peace conference Israel                        meanwhile would try to keep Kilometer 101 talks alive by discussing subjects                        other than disengagement and would not take initiative of breaking off talksIn telegram 3368 from Cairo November 27 Eilts reported Egyptian perceptions                            that while Israeli negotiators at KM 101                            could not be accused of bad faith during the discussions since November                            11 implementation of the ceasefire accord had been marked by Israeli                            delays Ibid Box 639 Country Files Middle East Arab Republic of                            Egypt Vol X Nov 73Dec 31 1973 Although he did not read me                        text of formal GOI reply to US which he                        said Dinitz would convey he                        indicated reply called for Syria to start adhering to Geneva Convention on                        POWs if Syria was interested in attending peace conferenceIn telegram 9543 from Tel Aviv November 27 Keating reported that in his                            conversation with Eban the                            Foreign Minister had been most interested in the modalities of convening                            the Geneva peace conference He had reiterated the Israeli Government                            position that it would not sit down to negotiate with Syria until the                            Syrians started complying with the Geneva Convention on POWs He also                            reaffirmed the Israeli position against negotiations with Arafat and those murderers in Beirut

to get Soviets to push for POW exchange and that Israeli public opinion would require                            POW exchange before Israel could                        negotiate with Syria Eban added that                            GOI was expecting Secretary to visit                        Israel December 16 following visits to Arab capitals including Damascus                        End summary2 Eban invited me to Jerusalem                        evening of November 26 for briefing on latest Middle East settlement                        developments Also present were Assistant DirGen MFA Evron North                        American Director Elizur DCM and PolOffSmith3 Eban said Secretary had been                        interested in two things during their conversations last week:See footnote 4 Document                                350 a formal GOI                        decision to accept procedures for Middle East peace conference and b                        Israeli agreement to transfer question of disengagement of forces from                        Kilometer 101 talks to peace conference Secretarys proposal re peace                        conference involved date venue and levels Eban learned that US proposal had been discussed with                        various governments concerned and that Israeli amendments could mean                        undesirable delays in getting conference started Secretary had impressed on                            Eban that chief thing was opening                        date importance of which Israelis had not realized Secretary had said date                        of opening could have positive effect on ceasefire in Middle East and on                        easing energy crisis Creation of fact of conference would have important                        psychological effect across the board whereas any postponement would arouse                        great suspicion4 Eban said that when all this was                        explained to Israeli Cabinet November 25 GOI had decided to accept proposal GOI reply to USG was now being                        delivered in Washington by Israeli Ambassador GOI reply among other things noted expectation that if Syria                        were to attend the conference Syria first would have to commence                        observation of Geneva Convention                        concerning POWs Eban continued only                        thing Israel now awaited was to learn exact terms in which formal invitation                        to peace conference would be couched Eban presumed invitation would be based on Resolution 338                        would state who the participants were to be and would indicate that purpose                        of conference is negotiations and agreement with Israel Even if Arafat wanted to wreck conference                            Eban doubted he would be willing                        to come to conference purpose of which contradicted the very reason for                        existence of fedayeen organizations Eban hoped list of participants in invitation would be as it                        had been outlined to Eban in                        Washington5 Eban turned to what he described as                        Secretarys second request of Israel: agreement to transfer discussion of                        disengagement issue from Kilometer 101 talks to Geneva Eban said this was more of a problem for                        Israel Israelis had thought it would be good to have stabilization of                        ceasefire in effect before peace conference Secretary believed this could                        be handled at Geneva and that US could assure Israel that Egyptians and                        Soviets would not during interim resume fire or rush off to UN Security Council He had told Eban that US could hold the line6 Eban said he still had not received                        report on outcome of November 26 meeting at Kilometer 101 In November 24                        meeting at Kilometer 101 it looked as though Secretarys prediction that                        Israel would not be able to achieve agreement on disengagement through these                        talks was coming trueSee footnote 2 Document 358Eban noted his understanding was                        disengagement issue would be covered in JanuaryFebruary sessions of peace                        conference rather than at opening meeting7 At this point I asked Eban if his                        understanding was that opening meeting on December 18 would be purely                        formal and he said yes Eban added                        that although opening session would not bring substantive progress choice                        of date would help situation as there would not be long wait Symbolism of                        opening session would in itself be very important8 I asked Eban if he did not consider                        fact of ongoing talks at Kilometer 101 was in itself a breakthrough                            Eban said this was true However                        these talks were less difficult for Egyptians than peace conference because                        Egyptians could answer critics of Kilometer 101 meetings by pointing out                        that Egypt met with Israel previously on military level under terms of 1949                        Armistice Agreement Now that opportunity existed to commence actual peace                        conference Israel had to seize it as it might be fleeting As for                        nonsubstantive nature of opening session Foreign Ministers would be                        present from Arab countries Israel US and USSR and UN Secretary General                        would also be present meaning there would be sufficient number of general statements to last a couple of                        days9 I asked how Israel at opening session would be able to schedule next                        meeting of conference in January when Israelis would not know how long it                        would take them to form new government Eban replied if party composition of new Israeli Government                        would be the same as present one which he expected formation should not                        take too long I then asked specifically if Israel would be prepared at                        December 18 session to set date for next meeting Eban said yes and suggested Israelis in                        setting date could note in passing their assumption that next GOI would have same composition Even if                        things turned out differently and formation of government took longer than                        expected it would be wise at December 18 meeting to set date in January and                        then later if necessary request postponement of a few days10 I asked Eban if he was concerned                        about reported Soviet efforts to assist in forming Palestinian government in                        exile and how he related this to general picture Eban said he was quite concerned about this                        Soviet activity He said he did not know what exactly Soviets were trying to                        do This development made it all the more important to Israel to receive                        list of participants in peace conference In Israels oral exchange on                        subject with us all that had been specified was that conference should                        begin on December 18 in Geneva commencing at Foreign Minister level with                        countries which took part in October war plus UN Secretary General He added conference at later time could                        be expanded to include all belligerents of 1967 and 1973 wars I noted US                        was aware that Israel would not want to sit down with Arafat and others like him and I had                        reported this feeling to Washington as conveyed to me by Prime Minister                            Eban said that even if one set                        aside Jordanian positin on this issue Israel would have great difficulty                        with it It therefore was important that invitation state purposes of peace                        conference Eban continued he had                        told Secretary that if King Hussein                        were to include Palestinians in his delegation that would be another                        matter These could include West Bank Arabs who are King Husseins citizens and who reside in what                        formerly was Palestine but not people who live in Beirut11 Eban then turned to Secretarys                        assurances that transfer of disengagement discussions to Geneva could be                        arranged without danger that Soviets or Egyptians would take matter to                            UN Security Council Eban replied Secretary had assured him                        Egypt and USSR would agree to postpone                        further litigation over disengagement issue Secretary had also told                            Eban he believed Egypt would                        respect ceasefire Eban said he was                        glad to have very strong US assurances that neither political nor                        military action would be taken between now and peace conference I asked Eban if his feeling of confidence extended also to Syria                        and Eban merely replied that Syrians                        were a problem12 I asked Eban if Egyptians had                        given Israel a position on disengagement in Kilometer 101 talks on                        takeitorleaveitbasis which was unacceptable to Israel or whether                        Egyptians in Israeli view were trying to maneuver situation so that Israel                        could be accused of breaking off these talks If so it occurred to me there                        were many other topics Israel could discuss to keep talks going Eban said that in GOIs formal reply to us concerning opening of peace                        conference GOI had specified that Israelis                        would not take initiative of breaking off Kilometer 101 talks and in fact                        would try to keep talks alive Yariv had been instructed that if no                        progress on disengagement was evident in his forum he was to agree to                        transfer of this issue to Geneva Eban said Yariv was instructed to say GOI could not accept proposal made by GOE November 24At the November 22 meeting at KM 101                            General Gamasy proposed an                            initial and temporary disengagement and separation of forces                            Telegram 5040 from USUN November 23                            National Archives RG 59 Central                            Foreign Policy Files He clarified his proposal at the November 23                            meeting Telegram 5074 from USUN                            November 24 ibid he doubted Egyptians would be offering new                        concessions although he said he would inform me promptly if anything of                        substance happened at Nov 26 meeting at KM                        101 Press this morning reports no progress was madeIn telegram 5114 from USUN November 27 Bennett reported on the November 26 KM 101 meeting during which Yaariv turned down Gamasys earlier disengagement                            proposal and said Israel could not accept Gamasys proposed force level for Egyptian forces on the                            East Bank suggesting these be reduced to a token level It was agreed                            that Yaariv would go back for                            more instructions and would propose lines for Israeli forces beyond the                            main force Gamasy would then                            reconsider the question of Egyptian strength east of the canal but he                            made it clear that Egypt would accept no limitations on Egyptian                            strength west of the canal Bennett noted that it seemed that the Israelis were                            holding out the promise of considerable concessions but were unwilling                            to be pinned down until the elections andor peace talks Ibid                                Nixon Presidential                            Materials NSC Files Box

December 5 1973 2 of 313 I asked Eban for his view of how                        Arab summit would affect climate between now and peace conf Eban said Secretary had been aware of                        forthcoming Arab summit when he assured Eban Egyptians and Soviets would not disrupt ceasefire or                        resort to UN Security Council during interim                        before peace conf At the same time Eban said he was concerned about                        Egyptian public statements which were threatening and about fact Syria also                        issuing such statements He felt that Israel would have to consider                        atmosphere and rhetoric in area before and during conf although it was                        better not to raise this subject before Arab summit14 In context of discussing importance of creating conducive atmosphere                        before peace conf Eban again turned                        to issue of Israeli POWs in Syria Eban saw no solution but to go on putting pressures on Syria in various ways especially                        through Soviets Secretary had been unable to confirm by time of Ebans departure from US whether Syria                        would come to peace conf or not Secretary had talked late last week with                        Syrian Rep at UN who only said he would                        report US concern about POW issue to                            DamascusSee Document                                350Waldheim had told Eban that Syrian official who had made                        original more flexible proposal for POW                        exchange from which Syria had subsequently backed off had now been shunted                        off to Bonn Nevertheless if Syria really were interested in coming to                        peace conf this in Ebans opinion                        would create some leverage on POW issue It                        was known

                 had now acceded to two US requests conveyed through him to attend peace                        conference opening December 18 in Geneva and to agree with Egyptians in                        Kilometer 101 talks to transfer further discussion of disengagement issue to                        JanuaryFebruary sessions of Geneva peace conference Eban said he assumed formal invitation to                        peace conference when it came would through either its listing of                        participants or its description of conference purposes preclude fedayeen                        participation Eban said Secretary                        had given him very strong assurances that US could induce Egypt and                            USSR to agree on maintenance of                        ceasefire and on nonresort to UN Security                        Council during interim between now and opening of peace conference Israel                        meanwhile would try to keep Kilometer 101 talks alive by discussing subjects                        other than disengagement and would not take initiative of breaking off talksIn telegram 3368 from Cairo November 27 Eilts reported Egyptian perceptions                            that while Israeli negotiators at KM 101                            could not be accused of bad faith during the discussions since November

  indicated reply called for Syria to start adhering to Geneva Convention on                        POWs if Syria was interested in attending peace conferenceIn telegram 9543 from Tel Aviv November 27 Keating reported that in his                            conversation with Eban the                            Foreign Minister had been most interested in the modalities of convening                            the Geneva peace conference He had reiterated the Israeli Government                            position that it would not sit down to negotiate with Syria until the                            Syrians started complying with the Geneva Convention on POWs He also                            reaffirmed the Israeli position against negotiations with Arafat and those murderers in Beirut

to get Soviets to push for POW exchange and that Israeli public opinion would require                            POW exchange before Israel could                        negotiate with Syria Eban added that                            GOI was expecting Secretary to visit                        Israel December 16 following visits to Arab capitals including Damascus                        End summary2 Eban invited me to Jerusalem                        evening of November 26 for briefing on latest Middle East settlement                        developments Also present were Assistant DirGen MFA Evron North                        American Director Elizur DCM and PolOffSmith3 Eban said Secretary had been                        interested in two things during their conversations last week:See footnote 4 Document                                350 a formal GOI                        decision to accept procedures for Middle East peace conference and b                        Israeli agreement to transfer question of disengagement of forces from                        Kilometer 101 talks to peace conference Secretarys proposal re peace                        conference involved date venue and levels Eban learned that US proposal had been discussed with                        various governments concerned and that Israeli amendments could mean                        undesirable delays in getting conference started Secretary had impressed on                            Eban that chief thing was opening                        date importance of which Israelis had not realized Secretary had said date                        of opening could have positive effect on ceasefire in Middle East and on                        easing energy crisis Creation of fact of conference would have important                        psychological effect across the board whereas any postponement would arouse                        great suspicion4 Eban said that when all this was                        explained to Israeli Cabinet November 25 GOI had decided to accept proposal GOI reply to USG was now being                        delivered in Washington by Israeli Ambassador GOI reply among other things noted expectation that if Syria                        were to attend the conference Syria first would have to commence                        observation of Geneva Convention                        concerning POWs Eban continued only                        thing Israel now awaited was to learn exact terms in which formal invitation                        to peace conference would be couched Eban presumed invitation would be based on Resolution 338                        would state who the participants were to be and would indicate that purpose                        of conference is negotiations and agreement with Israel Even if Arafat wanted to wreck conference                            Eban doubted he would be willing                        to come to conference purpose of which contradicted the very reason for                        existence of fedayeen organizations Eban hoped list of participants in invitation would be as it                        had been outlined to Eban in                        Washington5 Eban turned to what he described as                        Secretarys second request of Israel: agreement to transfer discussion of                        disengagement issue from Kilometer 101 talks to Geneva Eban said this was more of a problem for                        Israel Israelis had thought it would be good to have stabilization of                        ceasefire in effect before peace conference Secretary believed this could                        be handled at Geneva and that US could assure Israel that Egyptians and                        Soviets would not during interim resume fire or rush off to UN Security Council He had told Eban that US could hold the line6 Eban said he still had not received                        report on outcome of November 26 meeting at Kilometer 101 In November 24                        meeting at Kilometer 101 it looked as though Secretarys prediction that                        Israel would not be able to achieve agreement on disengagement through these                        talks was coming trueSee footnote 2 Document 358Eban noted his understanding was                        disengagement issue would be covered in JanuaryFebruary sessions of peace                        conference rather than at opening meeting7 At this point I asked Eban if his                        understanding was that opening meeting on December 18 would be purely                        formal and he said yes Eban added                        that although opening session would not bring substantive progress choice                        of date would help situation as there would not be long wait Symbolism of                        opening session would in itself be very important8 I asked Eban if he did not consider                        fact of ongoing talks at Kilometer 101 was in itself a breakthrough                            Eban said this was true However                        these talks were less difficult for Egyptians than peace conference because                        Egyptians could answer critics of Kilometer 101 meetings by pointing out                        that Egypt met with Israel previously on military level under terms of 1949                        Armistice Agreement Now that opportunity existed to commence actual peace                        conference Israel had to seize it as it might be fleeting As for                        nonsubstantive nature of opening session Foreign Ministers would be                        present from Arab countries Israel US and USSR and UN Secretary General                        would also be present meaning there would be sufficient number of general statements to last a couple of                        days9 I asked how Israel at opening session would be able to schedule next                        meeting of conference in January when Israelis would not know how long it                        would take them to form new government Eban replied if party composition of new Israeli Government                        would be the same as present one which he expected formation should not                        take too long I then asked specifically if Israel would be prepared at                        December 18 session to set date for next meeting Eban said yes and suggested Israelis in                        setting date could note in passing their assumption that next GOI would have same composition Even if                        things turned out differently and formation of government took longer than                        expected it would be wise at December 18 meeting to set date in January and                        then later if necessary request postponement of a few days10 I asked Eban if he was concerned                        about reported Soviet efforts to assist in forming Palestinian government in                        exile and how he related this to general picture Eban said he was quite concerned about this                        Soviet activity He said he did not know what exactly Soviets were trying to                        do This development made it all the more important to Israel to receive                        list of participants in peace conference In Israels oral exchange on                        subject with us all that had been specified was that conference should                        begin on December 18 in Geneva commencing at Foreign Minister level with                        countries which took part in October war plus UN Secretary General He added conference at later time could                        be expanded to include all belligerents of 1967 and 1973 wars I noted US                        was aware that Israel would not want to sit down with Arafat and others like him and I had                        reported this feeling to Washington as conveyed to me by Prime Minister                            Eban said that even if one set                        aside Jordanian positin on this issue Israel would have great difficulty                        with it It therefore was important that invitation state purposes of peace                        conference Eban continued he had                        told Secretary that if King Hussein                        were to include Palestinians in his delegation that would be another                        matter These could include West Bank Arabs who are King Husseins citizens and who reside in what                        formerly was Palestine but not people who live in Beirut11 Eban then turned to Secretarys                        assurances that transfer of disengagement discussions to Geneva could be                        arranged without danger that Soviets or Egyptians would take matter to                            UN Security Council Eban replied Secretary had assured him                        Egypt and USSR would agree to postpone                        further litigation over disengagement issue Secretary had also told                            Eban he believed Egypt would                        respect ceasefire Eban said he was                        glad to have very strong US assurances that neither political nor                        military action would be taken between now and peace conference I asked Eban if his feeling of confidence extended also to Syria                        and Eban merely replied that Syrians                        were a problem12 I asked Eban if Egyptians had                        given Israel a position on disengagement in Kilometer 101 talks on                        takeitorleaveitbasis which was unacceptable to Israel or whether                        Egyptians in Israeli view were trying to maneuver situation so that Israel                        could be accused of breaking off these talks If so it occurred to me there                        were many other topics Israel could discuss to keep talks going Eban said that in GOIs formal reply to us concerning opening of peace                        conference GOI had specified that Israelis                        would not take initiative of breaking off Kilometer 101 talks and in fact                        would try to keep talks alive Yariv had been instructed that if no                        progress on disengagement was evident in his forum he was to agree to                        transfer of this issue to Geneva Eban said Yariv was instructed to say GOI could not accept proposal made by GOE November 24At the November 22 meeting at KM 101                            General Gamasy proposed an                            initial and temporary disengagement and separation of forces                            Telegram 5040 from USUN November 23                            National Archives RG 59 Central                            Foreign Policy Files He clarified his proposal at the November 23                            meeting Telegram 5074 from USUN                            November 24 ibid he doubted Egyptians would be offering new                        concessions although he said he would inform me promptly if anything of                        substance happened at Nov 26 meeting at KM                        101 Press this morning reports no progress was madeIn telegram 5114 from USUN November 27 Bennett reported on the November 26 KM 101 meeting during which Yaariv turned down Gamasys earlier disengagement                            proposal and said Israel could not accept Gamasys proposed force level for Egyptian forces on the                            East Bank suggesting these be reduced to a token level It was agreed                            that Yaariv would go back for                            more instructions and would propose lines for Israeli forces beyond the                            main force Gamasy would then                            reconsider the question of Egyptian strength east of the canal but he                            made it clear that Egypt would accept no limitations on Egyptian                            strength west of the canal Bennett noted that it seemed that the Israelis were                            holding out the promise of considerable concessions but were unwilling                            to be pinned down until the elections andor peace talks Ibid                                Nixon Presidential                            Materials NSC Files Box

December 5 1973 2 of 313 I asked Eban for his view of how                        Arab summit would affect climate between now and peace conf Eban said Secretary had been aware of                        forthcoming Arab summit when he assured Eban Egyptians and Soviets would not disrupt ceasefire or                        resort to UN Security Council during interim                        before peace conf At the same time Eban said he was concerned about                        Egyptian public statements which were threatening and about fact Syria also                        issuing such statements He felt that Israel would have to consider                        atmosphere and rhetoric in area before and during conf although it was                        better not to raise this subject before Arab summit14 In context of discussing importance of creating conducive atmosphere                        before peace conf Eban again turned                        to issue of Israeli POWs in Syria Eban saw no solution but to go on putting pressures on Syria in various ways especially                        through Soviets Secretary had been unable to confirm by time of Ebans departure from US whether Syria                        would come to peace conf or not Secretary had talked late last week with                        Syrian Rep at UN who only said he would                        report US concern about POW issue to                            DamascusSee Document                                350Waldheim had told Eban that Syrian official who had made                        original more flexible proposal for POW                        exchange from which Syria had subsequently backed off had now been shunted                        off to Bonn Nevertheless if Syria really were interested in coming to                        peace conf this in Ebans opinion                        would create some leverage on POW issue It                        was known fact that Israeli public opinion would not allow peace                        negotiations with Syria without POW                        exchange first Any Syrian expression of interest in peace conf Eban said would give us excellent                        opportunity to speak to Soviets about need for POW exchange15 At end of meeting Eban said GOI was looking forward to Secretarys arrival                        in Israel Dec 16 after which Secretary would go to Geneva He added he                        understood Secretary would first visit Arab capitals which he did not cover

                 had now acceded to two US requests conveyed through him to attend peace                        conference opening December 18 in Geneva and to agree with Egyptians in                        Kilometer 101 talks to transfer further discussion of disengagement issue to                        JanuaryFebruary sessions of Geneva peace conference Eban said he assumed formal invitation to                        peace conference when it came would through either its listing of                        participants or its description of conference purposes preclude fedayeen                        participation Eban said Secretary                        had given him very strong assurances that US could induce Egypt and                            USSR to agree on maintenance of                        ceasefire and on nonresort to UN Security                        Council during interim between now and opening of peace conference Israel                        meanwhile would try to keep Kilometer 101 talks alive by discussing subjects                        other than disengagement and would not take initiative of breaking off talksIn telegram 3368 from Cairo November 27 Eilts reported Egyptian perceptions                            that while Israeli negotiators at KM 101                            could not be accused of bad faith during the discussions since November

  indicated reply called for Syria to start adhering to Geneva Convention on                        POWs if Syria was interested in attending peace conferenceIn telegram 9543 from Tel Aviv November 27 Keating reported that in his                            conversation with Eban the                            Foreign Minister had been most interested in the modalities of convening                            the Geneva peace conference He had reiterated the Israeli Government                            position that it would not sit down to negotiate with Syria until the                            Syrians started complying with the Geneva Convention on POWs He also                            reaffirmed the Israeli position against negotiations with Arafat and those murderers in Beirut

to get Soviets to push for POW exchange and that Israeli public opinion would require                            POW exchange before Israel could                        negotiate with Syria Eban added that                            GOI was expecting Secretary to visit                        Israel December 16 following visits to Arab capitals including Damascus                        End summary2 Eban invited me to Jerusalem                        evening of November 26 for briefing on latest Middle East settlement                        developments Also present were Assistant DirGen MFA Evron North                        American Director Elizur DCM and PolOffSmith3 Eban said Secretary had been                        interested in two things during their conversations last week:See footnote 4 Document                                350 a formal GOI                        decision to accept procedures for Middle East peace conference and b                        Israeli agreement to transfer question of disengagement of forces from                        Kilometer 101 talks to peace conference Secretarys proposal re peace                        conference involved date venue and levels Eban learned that US proposal had been discussed with                        various governments concerned and that Israeli amendments could mean                        undesirable delays in getting conference started Secretary had impressed on                            Eban that chief thing was opening                        date importance of which Israelis had not realized Secretary had said date                        of opening could have positive effect on ceasefire in Middle East and on                        easing energy crisis Creation of fact of conference would have important                        psychological effect across the board whereas any postponement would arouse                        great suspicion4 Eban said that when all this was                        explained to Israeli Cabinet November 25 GOI had decided to accept proposal GOI reply to USG was now being                        delivered in Washington by Israeli Ambassador GOI reply among other things noted expectation that if Syria                        were to attend the conference Syria first would have to commence                        observation of Geneva Convention                        concerning POWs Eban continued only                        thing Israel now awaited was to learn exact terms in which formal invitation                        to peace conference would be couched Eban presumed invitation would be based on Resolution 338                        would state who the participants were to be and would indicate that purpose                        of conference is negotiations and agreement with Israel Even if Arafat wanted to wreck conference                            Eban doubted he would be willing                        to come to conference purpose of which contradicted the very reason for                        existence of fedayeen organizations Eban hoped list of participants in invitation would be as it                        had been outlined to Eban in                        Washington5 Eban turned to what he described as                        Secretarys second request of Israel: agreement to transfer discussion of                        disengagement issue from Kilometer 101 talks to Geneva Eban said this was more of a problem for                        Israel Israelis had thought it would be good to have stabilization of                        ceasefire in effect before peace conference Secretary believed this could                        be handled at Geneva and that US could assure Israel that Egyptians and                        Soviets would not during interim resume fire or rush off to UN Security Council He had told Eban that US could hold the line6 Eban said he still had not received                        report on outcome of November 26 meeting at Kilometer 101 In November 24                        meeting at Kilometer 101 it looked as though Secretarys prediction that                        Israel would not be able to achieve agreement on disengagement through these                        talks was coming trueSee footnote 2 Document 358Eban noted his understanding was                        disengagement issue would be covered in JanuaryFebruary sessions of peace                        conference rather than at opening meeting7 At this point I asked Eban if his                        understanding was that opening meeting on December 18 would be purely                        formal and he said yes Eban added                        that although opening session would not bring substantive progress choice                        of date would help situation as there would not be long wait Symbolism of                        opening session would in itself be very important8 I asked Eban if he did not consider                        fact of ongoing talks at Kilometer 101 was in itself a breakthrough                            Eban said this was true However                        these talks were less difficult for Egyptians than peace conference because                        Egyptians could answer critics of Kilometer 101 meetings by pointing out                        that Egypt met with Israel previously on military level under terms of 1949                        Armistice Agreement Now that opportunity existed to commence actual peace                        conference Israel had to seize it as it might be fleeting As for                        nonsubstantive nature of opening session Foreign Ministers would be                        present from Arab countries Israel US and USSR and UN Secretary General                        would also be present meaning there would be sufficient number of general statements to last a couple of                        days9 I asked how Israel at opening session would be able to schedule next                        meeting of conference in January when Israelis would not know how long it                        would take them to form new government Eban replied if party composition of new Israeli Government                        would be the same as present one which he expected formation should not                        take too long I then asked specifically if Israel would be prepared at                        December 18 session to set date for next meeting Eban said yes and suggested Israelis in                        setting date could note in passing their assumption that next GOI would have same composition Even if                        things turned out differently and formation of government took longer than                        expected it would be wise at December 18 meeting to set date in January and                        then later if necessary request postponement of a few days10 I asked Eban if he was concerned                        about reported Soviet efforts to assist in forming Palestinian government in                        exile and how he related this to general picture Eban said he was quite concerned about this                        Soviet activity He said he did not know what exactly Soviets were trying to                        do This development made it all the more important to Israel to receive                        list of participants in peace conference In Israels oral exchange on                        subject with us all that had been specified was that conference should                        begin on December 18 in Geneva commencing at Foreign Minister level with                        countries which took part in October war plus UN Secretary General He added conference at later time could                        be expanded to include all belligerents of 1967 and 1973 wars I noted US                        was aware that Israel would not want to sit down with Arafat and others like him and I had                        reported this feeling to Washington as conveyed to me by Prime Minister                            Eban said that even if one set                        aside Jordanian positin on this issue Israel would have great difficulty                        with it It therefore was important that invitation state purposes of peace                        conference Eban continued he had                        told Secretary that if King Hussein                        were to include Palestinians in his delegation that would be another                        matter These could include West Bank Arabs who are King Husseins citizens and who reside in what                        formerly was Palestine but not people who live in Beirut11 Eban then turned to Secretarys                        assurances that transfer of disengagement discussions to Geneva could be                        arranged without danger that Soviets or Egyptians would take matter to                            UN Security Council Eban replied Secretary had assured him                        Egypt and USSR would agree to postpone                        further litigation over disengagement issue Secretary had also told                            Eban he believed Egypt would                        respect ceasefire Eban said he was                        glad to have very strong US assurances that neither political nor                        military action would be taken between now and peace conference I asked Eban if his feeling of confidence extended also to Syria                        and Eban merely replied that Syrians                        were a problem12 I asked Eban if Egyptians had                        given Israel a position on disengagement in Kilometer 101 talks on                        takeitorleaveitbasis which was unacceptable to Israel or whether                        Egyptians in Israeli view were trying to maneuver situation so that Israel                        could be accused of breaking off these talks If so it occurred to me there                        were many other topics Israel could discuss to keep talks going Eban said that in GOIs formal reply to us concerning opening of peace                        conference GOI had specified that Israelis                        would not take initiative of breaking off Kilometer 101 talks and in fact                        would try to keep talks alive Yariv had been instructed that if no                        progress on disengagement was evident in his forum he was to agree to                        transfer of this issue to Geneva Eban said Yariv was instructed to say GOI could not accept proposal made by GOE November 24At the November 22 meeting at KM 101                            General Gamasy proposed an                            initial and temporary disengagement and separation of forces                            Telegram 5040 from USUN November 23                            National Archives RG 59 Central                            Foreign Policy Files He clarified his proposal at the November 23                            meeting Telegram 5074 from USUN                            November 24 ibid he doubted Egyptians would be offering new                        concessions although he said he would inform me promptly if anything of                        substance happened at Nov 26 meeting at KM                        101 Press this morning reports no progress was madeIn telegram 5114 from USUN November 27 Bennett reported on the November 26 KM 101 meeting during which Yaariv turned down Gamasys earlier disengagement                            proposal and said Israel could not accept Gamasys proposed force level for Egyptian forces on the                            East Bank suggesting these be reduced to a token level It was agreed                            that Yaariv would go back for                            more instructions and would propose lines for Israeli forces beyond the                            main force Gamasy would then                            reconsider the question of Egyptian strength east of the canal but he                            made it clear that Egypt would accept no limitations on Egyptian                            strength west of the canal Bennett noted that it seemed that the Israelis were                            holding out the promise of considerable concessions but were unwilling                            to be pinned down until the elections andor peace talks Ibid                                Nixon Presidential                            Materials NSC Files Box

December 5 1973 2 of 313 I asked Eban for his view of how                        Arab summit would affect climate between now and peace conf Eban said Secretary had been aware of                        forthcoming Arab summit when he assured Eban Egyptians and Soviets would not disrupt ceasefire or                        resort to UN Security Council during interim                        before peace conf At the same time Eban said he was concerned about                        Egyptian public statements which were threatening and about fact Syria also                        issuing such statements He felt that Israel would have to consider                        atmosphere and rhetoric in area before and during conf although it was                        better not to raise this subject before Arab summit14 In context of discussing importance of creating conducive atmosphere                        before peace conf Eban again turned                        to issue of Israeli POWs in Syria Eban saw no solution but to go on putting pressures on Syria in various ways especially                        through Soviets Secretary had been unable to confirm by time of Ebans departure from US whether Syria                        would come to peace conf or not Secretary had talked late last week with                        Syrian Rep at UN who only said he would                        report US concern about POW issue to                            DamascusSee Document                                350Waldheim had told Eban that Syrian official who had made                        original more flexible proposal for POW                        exchange from which Syria had subsequently backed off had now been shunted                        off to Bonn Nevertheless if Syria really were interested in coming to                        peace conf this in Ebans opinion                        would create some leverage on POW issue It                        was known fact that Israeli public opinion would not allow peace                        negotiations with Syria without POW                        exchange first Any Syrian expression of interest in peace conf Eban said would give us excellent                        opportunity to speak to Soviets about need for POW exchange15 At end of meeting Eban said GOI was looking forward to Secretarys arrival                        in Israel Dec 16 after which Secretary would go to Geneva He added he                        understood Secretary would first visit Arab capitals which he did not cover                        on his Mid East trip and that this would include DamascusKeating,frus1969-76v25d361,"1.

                 had now acceded to two US requests conveyed through him to attend peace                        conference opening December 18 in Geneva and to agree with Egyptians in                        Kilometer 101 talks to transfer further discussion of disengagement issue to                        JanuaryFebruary sessions of Geneva peace conference Eban said he assumed formal invitation to                        peace conference when it came would through either its listing of                        participants or its description of conference purposes preclude fedayeen                        participation Eban said Secretary                        had given him very strong assurances that US could induce Egypt and                            USSR to agree on maintenance of                        ceasefire and on nonresort to UN Security                        Council during interim between now and opening of peace conference Israel                        meanwhile would try to keep Kilometer 101 talks alive by discussing subjects                        other than disengagement and would not take initiative of breaking off talksIn telegram 3368 from Cairo November 27 Eilts reported Egyptian perceptions                            that while Israeli negotiators at KM 101                            could not be accused of bad faith during the discussions since November                            11 implementation of the ceasefire accord had been marked by Israeli                            delays Ibid Box 639 Country Files Middle East Arab Republic of                            Egypt Vol X Nov 73Dec 31 1973 Although he did not read me                        text of formal GOI reply to US which he                        said Dinitz would convey he                        indicated reply called for Syria to start adhering to Geneva Convention on                        POWs if Syria was interested in attending peace conferenceIn telegram 9543 from Tel Aviv November 27 Keating reported that in his                            conversation with Eban the                            Foreign Minister had been most interested in the modalities of convening                            the Geneva peace conference He had reiterated the Israeli Government                            position that it would not sit down to negotiate with Syria until the                            Syrians started complying with the Geneva Convention on POWs He also                            reaffirmed the Israeli position against negotiations with Arafat and those murderers in Beirut                            Ibid Box 611 Country Files Middle East Israel Vol 13 Nov                            73Dec 73 He said that any such Syrian interest would create                        opening for US to get Soviets to push for POW exchange and that Israeli public opinion would require                            POW exchange before Israel could                        negotiate with Syria Eban added that                            GOI was expecting Secretary to visit                        Israel December 16 following visits to Arab capitals including Damascus                        End summary2 Eban invited me to Jerusalem                        evening of November 26 for briefing on latest Middle East settlement                        developments Also present were Assistant DirGen MFA Evron North                        American Director Elizur DCM and PolOffSmith3 Eban said Secretary had been                        interested in two things during their conversations last week:See footnote 4 Document                                350 a formal GOI                        decision to accept procedures for Middle East peace conference and b                        Israeli agreement to transfer question of disengagement of forces from                        Kilometer 101 talks to peace conference Secretarys proposal re peace                        conference involved date venue and levels Eban learned that US proposal had been discussed with                        various governments concerned and that Israeli amendments could mean                        undesirable delays in getting conference started Secretary had impressed on                            Eban that chief thing was opening                        date importance of which Israelis had not realized Secretary had said date                        of opening could have positive effect on ceasefire in Middle East and on                        easing energy crisis Creation of fact of conference would have important                        psychological effect across the board whereas any postponement would arouse                        great suspicion4 Eban said that when all this was                        explained to Israeli Cabinet November 25 GOI had decided to accept proposal GOI reply to USG was now being                        delivered in Washington by Israeli Ambassador GOI reply among other things noted expectation that if Syria                        were to attend the conference Syria first would have to commence                        observation of Geneva Convention                        concerning POWs Eban continued only                        thing Israel now awaited was to learn exact terms in which formal invitation                        to peace conference would be couched Eban presumed invitation would be based on Resolution 338                        would state who the participants were to be and would indicate that purpose                        of conference is negotiations and agreement with Israel Even if Arafat wanted to wreck conference                            Eban doubted he would be willing                        to come to conference purpose of which contradicted the very reason for                        existence of fedayeen organizations Eban hoped list of participants in invitation would be as it                        had been outlined to Eban in                        Washington5 Eban turned to what he described as                        Secretarys second request of Israel: agreement to transfer discussion of                        disengagement issue from Kilometer 101 talks to Geneva Eban said this was more of a problem for                        Israel Israelis had thought it would be good to have stabilization of                        ceasefire in effect before peace conference Secretary believed this could                        be handled at Geneva and that US could assure Israel that Egyptians and                        Soviets would not during interim resume fire or rush off to UN Security Council He had told Eban that US could hold the line6 Eban said he still had not received                        report on outcome of November 26 meeting at Kilometer 101 In November 24                        meeting at Kilometer 101 it looked as though Secretarys prediction that                        Israel would not be able to achieve agreement on disengagement through these                        talks was coming trueSee footnote 2 Document 358Eban noted his understanding was                        disengagement issue would be covered in JanuaryFebruary sessions of peace                        conference rather than at opening meeting7 At this point I asked Eban if his                        understanding was that opening meeting on December 18 would be purely                        formal and he said yes Eban added                        that although opening session would not bring substantive progress choice                        of date would help situation as there would not be long wait Symbolism of                        opening session would in itself be very important8 I asked Eban if he did not consider                        fact of ongoing talks at Kilometer 101 was in itself a breakthrough                            Eban said this was true However                        these talks were less difficult for Egyptians than peace conference because                        Egyptians could answer critics of Kilometer 101 meetings by pointing out                        that Egypt met with Israel previously on military level under terms of 1949                        Armistice Agreement Now that opportunity existed to commence actual peace                        conference Israel had to seize it as it might be fleeting As for                        nonsubstantive nature of opening session Foreign Ministers would be                        present from Arab countries Israel US and USSR and UN Secretary General                        would also be present meaning there would be sufficient number of general statements to last a couple of                        days9 I asked how Israel at opening session would be able to schedule next                        meeting of conference in January when Israelis would not know how long it                        would take them to form new government Eban replied if party composition of new Israeli Government                        would be the same as present one which he expected formation should not                        take too long I then asked specifically if Israel would be prepared at                        December 18 session to set date for next meeting Eban said yes and suggested Israelis in                        setting date could note in passing their assumption that next GOI would have same composition Even if                        things turned out differently and formation of government took longer than                        expected it would be wise at December 18 meeting to set date in January and                        then later if necessary request postponement of a few days10 I asked Eban if he was concerned                        about reported Soviet efforts to assist in forming Palestinian government in                        exile and how he related this to general picture Eban said he was quite concerned about this                        Soviet activity He said he did not know what exactly Soviets were trying to                        do This development made it all the more important to Israel to receive                        list of participants in peace conference In Israels oral exchange on                        subject with us all that had been specified was that conference should                        begin on December 18 in Geneva commencing at Foreign Minister level with                        countries which took part in October war plus UN Secretary General He added conference at later time could                        be expanded to include all belligerents of 1967 and 1973 wars I noted US                        was aware that Israel would not want to sit down with Arafat and others like him and I had                        reported this feeling to Washington as conveyed to me by Prime Minister                            Eban said that even if one set                        aside Jordanian positin on this issue Israel would have great difficulty                        with it It therefore was important that invitation state purposes of peace                        conference Eban continued he had                        told Secretary that if King Hussein                        were to include Palestinians in his delegation that would be another                        matter These could include West Bank Arabs who are King Husseins citizens and who reside in what                        formerly was Palestine but not people who live in Beirut11 Eban then turned to Secretarys                        assurances that transfer of disengagement discussions to Geneva could be                        arranged without danger that Soviets or Egyptians would take matter to                            UN Security Council Eban replied Secretary had assured him                        Egypt and USSR would agree to postpone                        further litigation over disengagement issue Secretary had also told                            Eban he believed Egypt would                        respect ceasefire Eban said he was                        glad to have very strong US assurances that neither political nor                        military action would be taken between now and peace conference I asked Eban if his feeling of confidence extended also to Syria                        and Eban merely replied that Syrians                        were a problem12 I asked Eban if Egyptians had                        given Israel a position on disengagement in Kilometer 101 talks on                        takeitorleaveitbasis which was unacceptable to Israel or whether                        Egyptians in Israeli view were trying to maneuver situation so that Israel                        could be accused of breaking off these talks If so it occurred to me there                        were many other topics Israel could discuss to keep talks going Eban said that in GOIs formal reply to us concerning opening of peace                        conference GOI had specified that Israelis                        would not take initiative of breaking off Kilometer 101 talks and in fact                        would try to keep talks alive Yariv had been instructed that if no                        progress on disengagement was evident in his forum he was to agree to                        transfer of this issue to Geneva Eban said Yariv was instructed to say GOI could not accept proposal made by GOE November 24At the November 22 meeting at KM 101                            General Gamasy proposed an                            initial and temporary disengagement and separation of forces                            Telegram 5040 from USUN November 23                            National Archives RG 59 Central                            Foreign Policy Files He clarified his proposal at the November 23                            meeting Telegram 5074 from USUN                            November 24 ibid he doubted Egyptians would be offering new                        concessions although he said he would inform me promptly if anything of                        substance happened at Nov 26 meeting at KM                        101 Press this morning reports no progress was madeIn telegram 5114 from USUN November 27 Bennett reported on the November 26 KM 101 meeting during which Yaariv turned down Gamasys earlier disengagement                            proposal and said Israel could not accept Gamasys proposed force level for Egyptian forces on the                            East Bank suggesting these be reduced to a token level It was agreed                            that Yaariv would go back for                            more instructions and would propose lines for Israeli forces beyond the                            main force Gamasy would then                            reconsider the question of Egyptian strength east of the canal but he                            made it clear that Egypt would accept no limitations on Egyptian                            strength west of the canal Bennett noted that it seemed that the Israelis were                            holding out the promise of considerable concessions but were unwilling                            to be pinned down until the elections andor peace talks Ibid                                Nixon Presidential                            Materials NSC Files Box

December 5 1973 2 of 313 I asked Eban for his view of how                        Arab summit would affect climate between now and peace conf Eban said Secretary had been aware of                        forthcoming Arab summit when he assured Eban Egyptians and Soviets would not disrupt ceasefire or                        resort to UN Security Council during interim                        before peace conf At the same time Eban said he was concerned about                        Egyptian public statements which were threatening and about fact Syria also                        issuing such statements He felt that Israel would have to consider                        atmosphere and rhetoric in area before and during conf although it was                        better not to raise this subject before Arab summit14 In context of discussing importance of creating conducive atmosphere                        before peace conf Eban again turned                        to issue of Israeli POWs in Syria Eban saw no solution but to go on putting pressures on Syria in various ways especially                        through Soviets Secretary had been unable to confirm by time of Ebans departure from US whether Syria                        would come to peace conf or not Secretary had talked late last week with                        Syrian Rep at UN who only said he would                        report US concern about POW issue to                            DamascusSee Document                                350Waldheim had told Eban that Syrian official who had made                        original more flexible proposal for POW                        exchange from which Syria had subsequently backed off had now been shunted                        off to Bonn Nevertheless if Syria really were interested in coming to                        peace conf this in Ebans opinion                        would create some leverage on POW issue It                        was known fact that Israeli public opinion would not allow peace                        negotiations with Syria without POW                        exchange first Any Syrian expression of interest in peace conf Eban said would give us excellent                        opportunity to speak to Soviets about need for POW exchange15 At end of meeting Eban said GOI was looking forward to Secretarys arrival                        in Israel Dec 16 after which Secretary would go to Geneva He added he                        understood Secretary would first visit Arab capitals which he did not cover                        on his Mid East trip and that this would include DamascusKeating,frus1969-76v25d361,"1.
