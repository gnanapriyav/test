IbidSummary: Although known facts in case are very few                        murder of Lt Col Hawkins seems not motivated by personal considerations                        but rather a political act by unidentified terrorists We have no reason to                            believe situation affecting                        security of Americans in Iran has been drastically altered GOI is providing increased coverage for all                        Americans through roving patrols and Ambassador has written to all members                        of American community offering security guidance End                            summary1 Although there were two witnesses to murder of Lt Col Hawkins assassins                        were wearing motorcycle helmets and could not be identified To our                        knowledge Iranian police have no repeat no important leads on this crime                        Therefore addressees should bear in mind that any analysis or suggested                        background for murder is based only on reasonable assumption or                        speculation2 We have looked carefully into character and background of Lt Col Hawkins                        and find absolutely no reason to believe murder may have been motivated for                        personal reasons Hawkins enjoyed excellent reputation in American                        community Active in his church he was serious hardworking kind and                        conscientious officer His work in financial management at MAAG Headquarters included no controversial                        or sensitive material He led a very regular well ordered life Iranian                        authorities agree that Hawkins was not targeted for any personal or                        professional reasons3 Our best opinion is that Hawkins was picked as victim because he wore US                        Army uniform and early each workday waited for MAAG transportation on corner of fairly welltravelled street                        where he was easily noticed To reach that corner he had to walk two blocks                        past vacant lot where murderers attacked him4 It seems reasonable to conclude that Hawkins was picked as a target                        symbolic of USIranian ties garble US military support for Iranian Armed                        Forces considered one of main bulwarks of Shahs government By                        assassination terrorists hoped to embarrass regime demonstrate its                        inability to

                   Iranian police had broken up another terrorist group describing them as                            followers of an IslamicMarxist philosophy The telegram noted: GOI has in past categorized many of its                            more violent opponents as leftists of one stripe or other and has been                            reluctant to admit that base of opposition exists

authorities designed                            to deemphasize undoubted religious orientation of some terrorist                            groups Ibid POL 1310 IRAN We note from FBIS that clandestine radio Iran Courier on                        June 4 disavowed on behalf Tudeh Party Hawkins murder as individual                        terrorism and advocated mass action in violently attacking Shahs military                        buildup We naturally have no way of knowing at this point which group or                        possibly isolated individuals should be held responsible for murder7 Thus though GOI will continue to press                        relentlessly on groups and individuals suspected of terrorism experience                        demonstrates that there is little hope that this danger can be entirely                        eliminated One determined individual can threaten American security in Iran                        through series of incidents However although there may be other incidents                        we do garblenot believe there is any cause for undue alarm as to future                        security of official and private Americans in Tehran

There is                        of course possibility that CENTO                        meetings will like Presidential visit provide occasion for guerillas to                        embarrass GOI by

there may be other incidents                        we do garblenot believe there is any cause for undue alarm as to future                        security of official and private Americans in Tehran While we have had                        periodic unevaluated threats to Embassy and other US installations there                        have been no other attacks on Americans since Presidents visit There is                        of course possibility that CENTO                        meetings will like Presidential visit provide occasion for guerillas to                        embarrass GOI by

IbidSummary: Although known facts in case are very few                        murder of Lt Col Hawkins seems not motivated by personal considerations                        but rather a political act by unidentified terrorists We have no reason to                            believe situation affecting                        security of Americans in Iran has been drastically altered GOI is providing increased coverage for all                        Americans through roving patrols and Ambassador has written to all members                        of American community offering security guidance End                            summary1 Although there were two witnesses to murder of Lt Col Hawkins assassins                        were wearing motorcycle helmets and could not be identified To our                        knowledge Iranian police have no repeat no important leads on this crime                        Therefore addressees should bear in mind that any analysis or suggested                        background for murder is based only on reasonable assumption or                        speculation2 We have looked carefully into character and background of Lt Col Hawkins                        and find absolutely no reason to believe murder may have been motivated for                        personal reasons Hawkins enjoyed excellent reputation in American                        community Active in his church he was serious hardworking kind and                        conscientious officer His work in financial management at MAAG Headquarters included no controversial                        or sensitive material He led a very regular well ordered life Iranian                        authorities agree that Hawkins was not targeted for any personal or                        professional reasons3 Our best opinion is that Hawkins was picked as victim because he wore US                        Army uniform and early each workday waited for MAAG transportation on corner of fairly welltravelled street                        where he was easily noticed To reach that corner he had to walk two blocks                        past vacant lot where murderers attacked him4 It seems reasonable to conclude that Hawkins was picked as a target                        symbolic of USIranian ties garble US military support for Iranian Armed                        Forces considered one of main bulwarks of Shahs government By                        assassination terrorists hoped to embarrass regime demonstrate its                        inability to

authorities designed                            to deemphasize undoubted religious orientation of some terrorist                            groups Ibid POL 1310 IRAN We note from FBIS that clandestine

Thus though GOI will continue to press                        relentlessly on groups and individuals suspected of terrorism experience                        demonstrates that there is little hope

IbidSummary: Although known facts in case are very few                        murder of Lt Col Hawkins seems not motivated by personal considerations                        but rather a political act by unidentified terrorists We have no reason to                            believe situation affecting                        security of Americans in Iran has been drastically altered GOI is providing increased coverage for all                        Americans through roving patrols and Ambassador has written to all members                        of American community offering security guidance End                            summary1 Although there were two witnesses to murder of Lt Col Hawkins assassins                        were wearing motorcycle helmets and could not be identified To our                        knowledge Iranian police have no repeat no important leads on this crime                        Therefore addressees should bear in mind that any analysis or suggested                        background for murder is based only on reasonable assumption or                        speculation2 We have looked carefully into character and background of Lt Col Hawkins                        and find absolutely no reason to believe murder may have been motivated for                        personal reasons Hawkins enjoyed excellent reputation in American                        community Active in his church he was serious hardworking kind and                        conscientious officer His work in financial management at MAAG Headquarters included no controversial                        or sensitive material He led a very regular well ordered life Iranian                        authorities agree that Hawkins was not targeted for any personal or                        professional reasons3 Our best opinion is that Hawkins was picked as victim because he wore US                        Army uniform and early each workday waited for MAAG transportation on corner of fairly welltravelled street                        where he was easily noticed To reach that corner he had to walk two blocks                        past vacant lot where murderers attacked him4 It seems reasonable to conclude that Hawkins was picked as a target                        symbolic of USIranian ties garble US military support for Iranian Armed                        Forces considered one of main bulwarks of Shahs government By                        assassination terrorists hoped to embarrass regime demonstrate its                        inability to

attend the CENTO Ministerial meeting June 811Following is approved summary of Secretarys June 9 meeting with Shah of Iran                        in Tehran:Summary: The Secretary accompanied by Sisco and Helms had hour and forty minutes audience with Shah on 9                        June Subjects covered ranged widely to include Shahs recent trip dtente                        in Europe oil and gas Pakistan and the Subcontinent IranIraq relations                        US arms to Saudi Arabia and Kuwait ArabIsraeli impasse and CENTO and its relationship to Indian Ocean                        Greece was not discussed1 After photographs and normal amenities Shah touched on his recent trip                        devoting some minutes to Yugoslavia which he believes has the possibility of                        becoming an important European country in the next five years or so He                        remarked on how fit Tito appeared and referred to his energy as amazing                        in man of his age He and Secretary exchanged views about Romania and its                        leadership after which Shah mentioned that Bulgaria appears most tightly                        tied to Soviet Union of East Bloc countries he has visited He noted                        Bulgarias development of a reasonably sophisticated electronics                        industry2 After touching on the necessity of family planning in Iran with a current                        population of 31 million 50 percent of which is 15 years of age or under                        Shah passed on to a discussion of dtente in Europe between the United                        States and the Soviet Union He noted that the risk the US runs is in being                        obliged to bring American troops home The Secretary pointed out that the                        danger for the Soviets lay in opening up their society to the extent which                        was required by this dtente He also expressed his concerns about                        Congressional attitudes with respect to the maintenance of American troops                        in Western Europe The Shah noted his opinion that once the United States                        gets out of Europe it will never send military forces back there whereas                        the Soviets can always be back in Central and Western Europe within 24                        hours He then mentioned his talks with Heath and Brandt along the lines that peace in Europe                        is directly linked with the situation in the Middle East As he puts it if                        a regular supply of oil does not flow to Europe from the Middle East Europe                        could collapse without firing a shot He feels that both Heath and Brandt have got the message ie that                        something must be done to bring about a resolution of the ArabIsraeli                        stalemate3 At this juncture the Secretary congratulated the Shah on the signing of                        the oil agreement on May 24See footnote 4 Document 10 The Shah                        expressed his pleasure at the outcome and noted that Iran and West Germany                        are negotiating an arrangement whereby 500000 barrels per day of Iranian                        refined products will be sold to Western Germany He then spoke of Irans                        gas resources stating Iran has twice as much gas as all of the Arab states                        combined Thought is being given to building a pipeline to the Turkish                        border and on to Iskenderun A more ambitious project would have this gas pipeline continue on to Europe                        through Yugoslavia Trieste and branching out from there to Western Europe                        He noted certain conversations with Jamieson of Exxon about the possibility of piping Saudi                        Arabian gas to Iran and hitching it into such a pipeline There is no doubt                        that the Shah is more pleased about his arrangements on gas in the new                        agreement with the consortium than on any other aspect He is pushing the                        sale of LNG to Japan and the United                        States4 After expressing his wellknown views about subversion in the Persian Gulf                        and the maintenance of Pakistan integrity the Shah referred to a recent                        conversation between Marshal Grechko                        and the Iranian War Minister during which Grechkos queries about Irans purchase of arms from the                        United States were greeted with the comment that one may only pursue a                        policy of peace from a position of strength To this Marshal Grechko was obliged to agree The Shah                        pointed out that the stronger his country becomes the wiser his policies                        are permitted to be He noted to the Secretary that he told Kosygin that Iran could crush Iraq in a                        few hours a fact of life which kept Iraq from adventures against Iran He                        feels that the only thing which keeps Iraq from shelling the Abadan refinery                        or other depredations is the knowledge of what Iran could do in retaliation                        He alluded to a point which he had covered in greater detail in an earlier                        conversation with the Ambassador that is Iran can afford arms purchases on                        the scale envisaged because it is spending as much money as makes sense on                        domestic development As an example the Shah pointed out that if he were to                        take money from the military to build hospitals he could not find or train                        the doctors and nurses to man the hospitals He said that there are 1200                        Iranian doctors presently in West Germany who have been trained there and                        who like the bright lights and blond girls He feels that they will                        gradually come back to Iran but there is no way of forcing them at the                        moment In addition there are 4000 Iranian nurses in New York City alone                        and he points out there is no country known to him which has enough nurses                        at present therefore he would not be able to import them if he wanted to                        Put another way the Shah believes that two years of military training                        either on direct military work or in the health and literacy corps                        inculcates a kind of discipline which the young people of his country                        need5 The Secretary and the Shah discussed military aid to Pakistan They agreed                        that the Pakistan Armed Forces were a Russian salad made up of US                        British French Chinese and Russian equipment The Shah expressed the hope                        that the US would send arms directly to Pakistan the Secretary commenting                        that this was better than sending them through third countries like Iran                        FYI: Secretary was referring to present limited policy End FYI The Shah                        assumed that Pakistan requires spare                        parts transport in the form of C130s and assistance in retrofitting its                        tanks which can be done in Iran The Secretary mentioned that USG had approved the sale of Iranian C130s                        to Pakistan The Shah replied that he had so informed Bhutto on his recent visit to Tehran but                        had had no reply about this sale from him as yet The Shah then stated that                        he was doing his best to make a bridge between Pakistan and India He                        pointed out that he had told Bhutto                        that there was no point in the Pakistanis attempting a revengeful war                        against India The Secretary and he discussed the possibility of POW trial                        and the bad blood which this would engender Although Iran will not                        recognize Bangladesh until Pakistan does the Shah feels that a tripartite                        meeting without preconditions is the best way to proceed towards sorting out                        the subcontinent Both he and the Secretary noted that it would be useful if                        the British would reassure the Pakistanis by some gesture which would dull                        the impression that Britain is only behind India6 The conversation turned to the Persian Gulf The Shah queried as to how                        Iran can help Kuwait if Kuwait does not request it After reiterating his                        relief that the superpowers should stay out of the Gulf he turned to the                        dispute between Saudi Arabia and Abu Dhabi and indicated it was the last                        serious one in that part of the area He opined that the Saudis should do                        more to be helpful to North Yemen Oman and Kuwait The Secretary and he                        discussed the sale of F4s to Saudi Arabia and to Kuwait the Shah                        repeating his position that he had no objection to this development Both                        the Secretary and he agreed that Saudi Arabia was very slow at reaching                        decisions The US offer of a month ago to sell Phantoms being evidence of                        this since no firm reply has as yet been received from the Saudis Sisco described his hearing before the                            HFAC during which he explained the                        Iranian military buildupOn June 6 Sisco testified before the House                            Foreign Affairs Committee which was holding hearings on US interests                            in and policy toward the Persian Gulf US arms sales to Persian Gulf                            countries and the current status of IsraeliArab relations For                                Siscos testimony see New Perspectives on the Persian Gulf: Hearings Before                                the House Subcommittee on the Near East and South Asia of the                                Committee on Foreign Affairs 93rd Congress pp 134                            19737 The Shah then asked the Secretary what could be done to keep Sadat from                        committing suicide ie going to war The Shah stressed his oftmade                        recommendation that the Rogers Plan be reactivated in some form since                            Zayyat had told him Egypt will                        accept the Rogers Plan The Secretary pointed out that the Egyptians                        sometimes do not seem to understand what the Rogers Plan entails He                        indicated that nothing could now be done until after the Security Council                        debate on the Middle East He stressed that the United States was prepared                        to do anything it could to bring about direct or indirect talks between                        Egypt and Israel The Shah agreed but                        stated again that some proposal must be brought forward which does not seem                        onesided in favor of the Israelis He expressed the hope that the United                        States would pursue a more evenhanded policy in the area The Secretary                        pointed out that this was what the United States was trying to do and                        indicated that the United States has good relations these days with Lebanon                        Jordan the Sudan and even with Algeria It is doing everything it can to                        create a real impression of evenhandedness including maintaining regular                        contacts with the Egyptians The Shah indicated that there is no other way                        The Secretary further pointed out that both Israel and Egypt trust the                        United States and that we still have hopes of being able to accomplish                        something The Shah indicated that he would be glad to have Amb Hoveyda at the UN get in                        touch with Amb Scali to see if there is any way in which                        Iran can be helpful in New York at getting talks going8 The Secretary then queried whether the Shah would agree that CENTO is now a more useful vehicle than                        ever Noting that the Pakistanis want CENTO to help against India the Secretary indicated that this                        was not possible but that CENTO could be                        used to strengthen and provide support to Pakistan The Shah expressed                        agreement then stated that CENTO will                        become important in the Indian Ocean area as Iran becomes a naval power of                        increasing size This in his view should establish a deterrent in the Indian                        Ocean particularly when Iran has longlegged Phantoms air to surface                        missiles on her planes and a refueling capability to cover the area almost                        as far as Diego Garcia The Shah then noted that Iran has relations with                        South Africa and that General Frazer former Chief of Staff is coming to                        Iran as South African Consul General He concluded by again agreeing with                        the Secretary that CENTO has an                        increasingly important role to play9 Shah did not raise Greece as anticipated We assume this was because he                        had commented on this matter in his talks with Amb Helms earlier in                        weekRogers,frus1969-76v27d19,"1.   AFTER PHOTOGRAPHS AND NORMAL AMENITIES,  SHAH TOUCHED ON HIS RECENT TRIP,  DEVOTING SOME MINUTES TO YUGOSLAVIA WHICH HE BELIEVES HAS THE POSSIBILITY OF BECOMING AN IMPORTANT EUROPEAN COUNTRY IN THE NEXT FIVE YEARS OR SO. HE REMARKED ON HOW "" FIT""  TITO APPEARED AND REFERRED TO HIS ENERGY AS "" AMAZING""  IN MAN OF HIS AGE.   HE AND SECRETARY EXCHANGED VIEWS ABOUT ROMANIA AND ITS LEADERSHIP AFTER WHICH SHAH MENTIONED THAT BULGARIA APPEARS MOST TIGHTLY TIED TO SOVIET UNION OF EAST BLOC COUNTRIES HE HAS VISITED.   HE NOTED BULGARIA S DEVELOPMENT OF A REASONABLY SOPHISTICATED ELECTRONICS INDUSTRY.\n2.   AFTER TOUCHING ON THE NECESSITY OF FAMILY PLANNING IN IRAN WITH A CURRENT POPULATION OF 31  MILLION, 50  PERCENT OF WHICH IS 15  YEARS OF AGE OR UNDER,  SHAH PASSED ON TO A DISCUSSION OF DETENTE IN EUROPE BETWEEN THE UNITED STATES AND THE SOVIET UNION.   HE NOTED THAT THE RISK THE US RUNS IS IN BEING OBLIGED TO BRING AMERICAN TROOPS HOME.   THE SECRETARY POINTED OUT THAT THE DANGER FOR THE SOVIETS LAY IN OPENING UP THEIR SOCIETY TO THE EXTENT WHICH WAS RE- QUIRED BY THIS DETENTE.   HE ALSO EXPRESSED HIS CONCERNS ABOUT CONGRESSIONAL ATTITUDES WITH RESPECT TO THE MAIN- TENANCE OF AMERICAN TROOPS IN WESTERN EUROPE.   THE SHAH NOTED HIS OPINION THAT ONCE THE UNITED STATES GETS OUT OF EUROPE,  IT WILL NEVER SEND MILITARY FORCES BACK THERE WHEREAS THE SOVIETS CAN ALWAYS BE BACK IN CENTRAL AND WESTERN EUROPE WITHIN 24  HOURS.   HE THEN MENTIONED HIS TALKS WITH HEATH AND BRANDT ALONG THE LINES THAT PEACE IN EUROPE IS DIRECTLY LINKED WITH THE SITUATION IN THE MIDDLE EAST.   AS HE PUTS IT,  IF A REGULAR SUPPLY OF OIL DOES NOT FLOW TO EUROPE FROM THE MIDDLE EAST,  EUROPE COULD COLLAPSE WITHOUT FIRING A SHOT.   HE FEELS THAT BOTH HEATH AND BRANDT HAVE GOT THE MESSAGE,  I. E.,  THAT SOMETHING MUST BE DONE TO BRING ABOUT A RESOLUTION OF THE ARAB- ISRAELI STALEMATE.\n3.   AT THIS JUNCTURE THE SECRETARY CONGRATULATED THE SHAH     SECRET\n4.   THE SHAH EXPRESSED HIS PLEASURE AT THE OUTCOME AND NOTED THAT IRAN AND WEST GERMANY ARE NEGOTIATING AN ARRANGEMENT WHEREBY\n4.   AFTER EXPRESSING HIS WELL- KNOWN VIEWS ABOUT SUB- VERSION IN THE PERSIAN GULF AND THE MAINTENANCE OF PAKISTAN INTEGRITY,  THE SHAH REFERRED TO A RECENT CONVERSATION BETWEEN MARSHAL GRECHKO AND THE IRANIAN WAR MINISTER DURING WHICH GRECHKO S QUERIES ABOUT IRAN S PURCHASE OF ARMS FROM THE UNITED STATES WERE GREETED WITH THE COMMENT THAT ONE MAY ONLY PURSUE A POLICY OF PEACE FROM A POSITION OF STRENGTH.   TO THIS MARSHAL GRECHKO WAS OBLIGED TO AGREE. THE SHAH POINTED OUT THAT THE STRONGER HIS COUNTRY BECOMES, THE WISER HIS POLICIES ARE PERMITTED TO BE.   HE NOTED TO THE SECRETARY THAT HE TOLD KOSYGIN THAT IRAN COULD "" CRUSH IRAQ IN A FEW HOURS,""  A FACT OF LIFE WHICH KEPT IRAQ FROM ADVENTURES AGAINST IRAN.   HE FEELS THAT THE ONLY THING WHICH KEEPS IRAQ FROM SHELLING THE ABADAN REFINERY OR OTHER DEPREDATIONS IS THE KNOWLEDGE OF WHAT IRAN COULD DO IN RETALIATION.   HE ALLUDED TO A POINT WHICH HE HAD COVERED IN GREATER DETAIL IN AN EARLIER CONVERSATION WITH THE AMBASSADOR,  THAT IS,  IRAN CAN AFFORD ARMS PURCHASES ON THE SCALE ENVISAGED,  BECAUSE IT IS SPENDING AS MUCH MONEY AS MAKES SENSE ON DOMESTIC DEVELOPMENT.  AS AN EXAMPLE, THE SHAH POINTED OUT THAT IF HE WERE TO TAKE MONEY FROM THE MILITARY TO BUILD HOSPITALS,  HE COULD NOT FIND OR TRAIN     SECRET\n5.   THE SECRETARY AND THE SHAH DISCUSSED MILITARY AID TO PAKISTAN.   THEY AGREED THAT THE PAKISTAN ARMED FORCES WERE A "" RUSSIAN SALAD""  MADE UP OF US,  BRITISH,  FRENCH, CHINESE,  AND E E E E E E E E\n",916356

on to a discussion of dtente in Europe between the United                        States and the Soviet Union He noted that the risk the US runs is in being                        obliged to bring American troops home The Secretary pointed out that the                        danger for the Soviets lay in opening up their society to the extent which                        was required by this

his opinion that once the United States                        gets out of Europe it will never send military forces back there whereas                        the Soviets can always be back in Central

this juncture the Secretary congratulated the Shah on the signing of                        the oil agreement on May 24See footnote 4 Document 10 The Shah                        expressed his pleasure at the outcome and noted that Iran and West Germany                        are negotiating an arrangement whereby 500000 barrels per day of Iranian                        refined products will be sold to Western Germany He then spoke of Irans                        gas resources stating Iran has twice as much gas as all of the Arab states                        combined Thought is being given to building a pipeline to the Turkish                        border and on to Iskenderun A more ambitious project would have this gas pipeline continue on to Europe                        through Yugoslavia Trieste and branching out from there to Western Europe                        He noted certain conversations with Jamieson of Exxon about the possibility of piping Saudi                        Arabian gas to Iran and hitching it into such a pipeline There is no doubt                        that the Shah is more pleased about his arrangements on gas in the new                        agreement with the consortium than on any other aspect He is pushing the                        sale of LNG to Japan and the United                        States4 After expressing his wellknown views about subversion in the Persian Gulf                        and the maintenance of Pakistan integrity the Shah referred to a recent                        conversation between Marshal Grechko                        and the Iranian War Minister during which Grechkos queries about Irans purchase of arms from the                        United States were greeted with the comment that one may only pursue a                        policy of peace from a position of strength To this Marshal Grechko was obliged to agree The Shah                        pointed out that the stronger his country becomes the wiser his policies                        are permitted to be He noted to the Secretary that he told Kosygin that Iran could crush Iraq in a                        few hours a fact of life which kept Iraq from adventures against Iran He                        feels that the only thing which keeps Iraq from shelling the Abadan refinery                        or other depredations is the knowledge of what Iran could do in retaliation                        He alluded to a point which he had covered in greater detail in an earlier                        conversation with the Ambassador that is Iran can afford arms purchases on                        the scale envisaged because it is spending as much money as makes sense on                        domestic development As an example the Shah pointed out that if he were to                        take money from the military to build hospitals he could not find or train                        the doctors and nurses to man the hospitals He said that there are 1200                        Iranian doctors presently in West Germany who have been trained there and                        who like the bright lights and blond girls He feels that they will                        gradually come back to Iran but there is no way of forcing them at the                        moment In addition there are 4000 Iranian nurses in New York City alone                        and he points out there is no country known to him which has enough nurses                        at present therefore he would not be able to import them if he wanted to                        Put another way the Shah believes that two years of military training                        either on direct military work or in the health and literacy corps                        inculcates a kind of discipline which the young people of his country                        need5 The Secretary and the Shah discussed military aid to Pakistan They agreed                        that the Pakistan Armed Forces were a Russian salad made up of US                        British French Chinese and Russian equipment The Shah expressed the hope                        that the US would send arms directly to Pakistan the Secretary commenting                        that this was better than sending them through third countries like Iran                        FYI: Secretary was referring to present limited policy End FYI The Shah                        assumed that Pakistan requires spare                        parts transport in the form of C130s and assistance in retrofitting its                        tanks which can be done in Iran The Secretary mentioned that USG had approved the sale of Iranian C130s                        to Pakistan The Shah replied that he had so informed Bhutto on his recent visit to Tehran but                        had had no reply about this sale from him as yet The Shah then stated that                        he was doing his best to make a bridge between Pakistan and India He                        pointed out that he had told Bhutto                        that there was no point in the Pakistanis attempting a revengeful war                        against India The Secretary and he discussed the possibility of POW trial                        and the bad blood which this would engender Although Iran will not                        recognize Bangladesh until Pakistan does the Shah feels that a tripartite                        meeting without preconditions is the best way to proceed towards sorting out                        the subcontinent Both he and the Secretary noted that it would be useful if                        the British would reassure the Pakistanis by some gesture which would dull                        the impression that Britain is only behind India6 The conversation turned to the Persian Gulf The Shah queried as to how                        Iran can help Kuwait if Kuwait does not request it After reiterating his                        relief that the superpowers should stay out of the Gulf he turned to the                        dispute between Saudi Arabia and Abu Dhabi and indicated it was the last                        serious one in that part of the area He opined that the Saudis should do                        more to be helpful to North Yemen Oman and Kuwait The Secretary and he                        discussed the sale of F4s to Saudi Arabia and to Kuwait the Shah                        repeating his position that he had no objection to this development Both                        the Secretary and he agreed that Saudi Arabia was very slow at reaching                        decisions The US offer of a month ago to sell Phantoms being evidence of                        this since no firm reply has as yet been received from the Saudis Sisco described his hearing before the                            HFAC during which he explained the                        Iranian military buildupOn June 6 Sisco testified before the House                            Foreign Affairs Committee which was holding hearings on US interests                            in and policy toward the Persian Gulf US arms sales to Persian Gulf                            countries and the current status of IsraeliArab relations For

 Committee on Foreign Affairs 93rd Congress pp 134                            19737 The Shah then asked the Secretary what could be done to keep Sadat from                        committing suicide ie going to war The Shah stressed his oftmade                        recommendation that the Rogers Plan be reactivated in some form since                            Zayyat had told him Egypt will                        accept the Rogers Plan The Secretary pointed out that the Egyptians                        sometimes do not seem to understand what the Rogers Plan entails He                        indicated that nothing could now be done until after the Security Council                        debate on the Middle East He stressed that the United States was prepared                        to do anything it could to bring about direct or indirect talks between                        Egypt and Israel The Shah agreed but                        stated again that some proposal must be brought forward which does not seem                        onesided in favor of the Israelis He expressed the hope that the United                        States would pursue a more evenhanded policy in the area The Secretary                        pointed out that this was what the United States was trying to do and                        indicated that the United States has good relations these days with Lebanon                        Jordan the Sudan and even with Algeria It is doing everything it can to                        create a real impression of evenhandedness including maintaining regular                        contacts with the Egyptians The Shah indicated that there is no other way                        The Secretary further pointed out that both Israel and Egypt trust the                        United States and that we still have hopes of being able to accomplish                        something The Shah indicated that he would be glad to have Amb Hoveyda at the UN get in                        touch with Amb Scali to see if there is any way in which                        Iran can be helpful in New York at getting talks going8 The Secretary then queried whether the Shah would agree that CENTO is now a more useful vehicle than                        ever Noting that the Pakistanis want CENTO to help against India the Secretary indicated that this                        was not possible but that CENTO could be                        used to strengthen and provide support to Pakistan The Shah expressed                        agreement then stated that CENTO will                        become important in the Indian Ocean area as Iran becomes a naval power of                        increasing size This in his view should establish a deterrent in the Indian                        Ocean particularly when Iran has longlegged Phantoms air to surface                        missiles on her planes and a refueling capability to cover the area almost                        as far as Diego Garcia The Shah then noted that Iran has relations with                        South Africa and that General Frazer former Chief of Staff is coming to                        Iran as South African Consul General He concluded by again agreeing with                        the Secretary that CENTO has an                        increasingly important role to play9 Shah did not raise Greece as anticipated We assume this was because he                        had commented on this matter in his talks with Amb Helms earlier in

to attend the CENTO Ministerial meeting June 811Following is approved summary of Secretarys June 9 meeting with Shah of Iran                        in Tehran:Summary: The Secretary accompanied by Sisco and Helms had hour and forty minutes audience with Shah on 9                        June Subjects covered ranged widely to include Shahs recent trip dtente                        in Europe oil and gas Pakistan and the Subcontinent IranIraq relations                        US arms to Saudi Arabia and Kuwait ArabIsraeli impasse and CENTO and its relationship to Indian Ocean                        Greece was not discussed1 After photographs and normal amenities Shah touched on his recent trip                        devoting some minutes to Yugoslavia which he believes has the possibility of                        becoming an important European country in the next five years or so He                        remarked on how fit Tito appeared and referred to his energy as amazing                        in man of his age He and Secretary exchanged views about Romania and its                        leadership after which Shah mentioned that Bulgaria appears most tightly                        tied to Soviet Union of East Bloc countries he has visited He noted                        Bulgarias development of a reasonably sophisticated electronics                        industry2 After touching on the necessity of family planning in Iran with a current                        population of 31 million 50 percent of which is 15 years of age or under                        Shah passed on to a discussion of dtente in Europe between the United                        States and the Soviet Union He noted that the risk the US runs is in being                        obliged to bring American troops home The Secretary pointed out that the                        danger for the Soviets lay in opening up their society to the extent which                        was required by this dtente He also expressed his concerns about                        Congressional attitudes with respect to the maintenance of American troops                        in Western Europe The Shah noted his opinion that once the United States                        gets out of Europe it will never send military forces back there whereas                        the Soviets can always be back in Central and Western Europe within 24                        hours He then mentioned his talks with Heath and Brandt along the lines that peace in Europe                        is directly linked with the situation in the Middle East As he puts it if                        a regular supply of oil does not flow to Europe from the Middle East Europe                        could collapse without firing a shot He feels that both Heath and Brandt have got the message ie that                        something must be done to bring about a resolution of the ArabIsraeli                        stalemate3 At this juncture the Secretary congratulated the Shah on the signing of                        the oil agreement on May 24See footnote 4 Document 10 The Shah                        expressed his pleasure

to Western Germany He then spoke of Irans                        gas resources stating Iran has twice as much gas as all of the Arab states                        combined Thought is being given to building a pipeline to the Turkish                        border and on to Iskenderun A more ambitious project would have this gas pipeline continue on to Europe                        through Yugoslavia Trieste and branching out from there to Western Europe                        He noted certain conversations with Jamieson of Exxon about the possibility of piping Saudi                        Arabian gas to Iran and hitching it into such a pipeline There is no doubt                        that the Shah is more pleased about his arrangements on gas in the new

knowledge of what Iran could do in retaliation                        He alluded to a point which he had covered in greater detail in an earlier                        conversation with the Ambassador that is Iran can afford arms purchases on                        the scale envisaged because it is spending as much money as makes sense on                        domestic development As an example the Shah pointed out that if he were to                        take money from the military to build hospitals he could not find or train                        the doctors and nurses to man the

          that the Pakistan Armed Forces were a Russian salad made up of US                        British French Chinese and Russian equipment The Shah expressed the hope                        that the US would send arms directly to Pakistan the Secretary commenting                        that this was better than sending them through third countries like Iran                        FYI: Secretary was referring to present limited policy End FYI The Shah                        assumed that Pakistan requires spare                        parts transport in the form of C130s and assistance in retrofitting its                        tanks which can be done in Iran The Secretary mentioned that USG had approved the sale of Iranian C130s                        to Pakistan The Shah replied that he had so informed Bhutto on his recent visit to Tehran but                        had had no reply about this sale from him as yet The Shah then stated that                        he was doing his best to make a bridge between Pakistan and India He                        pointed out that he had told Bhutto                        that there was no point in the Pakistanis attempting a revengeful war                        against India The Secretary and he discussed the possibility of POW trial                        and the bad blood which this would engender Although Iran will not                        recognize Bangladesh until Pakistan does the Shah feels that a tripartite                        meeting without preconditions is the best way to proceed towards sorting out                        the subcontinent Both he and the Secretary noted that it would be useful if                        the British would reassure the Pakistanis by some gesture which would dull                        the impression that Britain is only behind India6 The conversation turned to the Persian Gulf The Shah queried as to how                        Iran can help Kuwait if Kuwait does not request it After reiterating his                        relief that the superpowers should stay out of the Gulf he turned to the                        dispute between Saudi Arabia and Abu Dhabi and indicated it was the last                        serious one in that part of the area He opined that the Saudis should do                        more to be helpful to North Yemen Oman and Kuwait The Secretary and he                        discussed the sale of F4s to Saudi Arabia and to Kuwait the Shah                        repeating his position that he had no objection to this development Both                        the Secretary and he agreed that Saudi Arabia was very slow at reaching                        decisions The US offer of a month ago to sell Phantoms being

 Committee on Foreign Affairs 93rd Congress pp 134                            19737 The Shah then asked the Secretary what could be done to keep Sadat from                        committing suicide ie going to war The Shah stressed his oftmade                        recommendation that the Rogers Plan be reactivated in some form since                            Zayyat had told him Egypt will                        accept the Rogers Plan The Secretary pointed out that the Egyptians                        sometimes do not seem to understand what the Rogers Plan entails He                        indicated that nothing could now be done until after the Security Council                        debate on the Middle East He stressed that the United States was prepared                        to do anything it could to bring about direct or indirect talks between                        Egypt and Israel The Shah agreed but                        stated again that some proposal must be brought forward which does not seem                        onesided in favor of the Israelis He expressed the hope that the United                        States would pursue a more evenhanded policy in the area The Secretary                        pointed out that this was what the United States was trying to do and                        indicated that the United States has good relations these days with Lebanon                        Jordan the Sudan and even with Algeria It is doing everything it can to                        create a real impression of evenhandedness including maintaining regular                        contacts with the Egyptians The Shah indicated that there is no other way                        The Secretary further pointed out that both Israel and Egypt trust the                        United States and that we still have hopes of being able to accomplish                        something The Shah indicated that he would be glad to have Amb Hoveyda at the UN get in                        touch with Amb Scali to see if there is any way in which                        Iran can be helpful in New York at getting talks going8 The Secretary then queried whether the Shah would agree that CENTO is now a more useful vehicle than                        ever Noting that the Pakistanis want CENTO to help against India the Secretary indicated that this                        was not possible but that CENTO could be                        used to strengthen and provide support to Pakistan The Shah expressed                        agreement then stated that CENTO will                        become important in the Indian Ocean area as Iran becomes a naval power of                        increasing size This in his view should establish a deterrent in the Indian                        Ocean particularly when Iran has longlegged Phantoms air to surface                        missiles on her planes and a refueling capability to cover the area almost                        as far as Diego Garcia The Shah then noted that Iran has relations with                        South Africa and that General Frazer former Chief of Staff is coming to                        Iran as South African Consul General He concluded by again agreeing with                        the Secretary that CENTO has an                        increasingly important role to play9 Shah did not raise Greece as anticipated We assume this was because he                        had commented on this matter in his talks with Amb Helms earlier in

to attend the CENTO Ministerial meeting June 811Following is approved summary of Secretarys June 9 meeting with Shah of Iran                        in Tehran:Summary: The Secretary accompanied by Sisco and Helms had hour and forty minutes audience with Shah on 9                        June Subjects covered ranged widely to include Shahs recent trip dtente                        in Europe oil and gas Pakistan and the Subcontinent IranIraq relations                        US arms to Saudi Arabia and Kuwait ArabIsraeli impasse and CENTO and its relationship to Indian Ocean                        Greece was not discussed1 After photographs and normal amenities Shah touched on his recent trip                        devoting some minutes to Yugoslavia which he believes has the possibility of                        becoming an important European country in the next five years or so He                        remarked on how fit Tito appeared and referred to his energy as amazing                        in man of his age He and Secretary exchanged views about Romania and its                        leadership after which Shah mentioned that Bulgaria appears most tightly                        tied to Soviet Union of East Bloc countries he has visited He noted                        Bulgarias development of a reasonably sophisticated electronics                        industry2 After touching on the necessity of family planning in Iran with a current                        population of 31 million 50 percent of which is 15 years of age or under                        Shah passed on to a discussion of dtente in Europe between the United                        States and the Soviet Union He noted that the risk the US runs is in being                        obliged to bring American troops home The Secretary pointed out that the                        danger for the Soviets lay in opening up their society to the extent which                        was required by this dtente He also expressed his concerns about                        Congressional attitudes with respect to the maintenance of American troops                        in Western Europe The Shah noted his opinion that once the United States                        gets out of Europe it will never send military forces back there whereas                        the Soviets can always be back in Central and Western Europe within 24                        hours He then mentioned his talks with Heath and Brandt along the lines that peace in Europe                        is directly linked with the situation in the Middle East As he puts it if                        a regular supply of oil does not flow to Europe from the Middle East Europe                        could collapse without firing a shot He feels that both Heath and Brandt have got the message ie that                        something must be done to bring about a resolution of the ArabIsraeli                        stalemate3 At this juncture the Secretary congratulated the Shah on the signing of                        the oil agreement on May 24See footnote 4 Document 10 The Shah                        expressed his pleasure at the outcome and noted that Iran and West Germany                        are negotiating an arrangement whereby 500000 barrels per day of Iranian                        refined products will be sold to Western Germany He then spoke of Irans                        gas resources stating Iran has twice as much gas as all of the Arab states                        combined Thought is being given to building a pipeline to the Turkish                        border and on to Iskenderun A more ambitious project would have this gas pipeline continue on to Europe                        through Yugoslavia Trieste and branching out from there to Western Europe                        He noted certain conversations with Jamieson of Exxon about the possibility of piping Saudi                        Arabian gas to Iran and hitching it into such a pipeline There is no doubt                        that the Shah is more pleased about his arrangements on gas in the new                        agreement with the consortium than on any other aspect He is pushing the                        sale of LNG to Japan and the United                        States4 After expressing his wellknown views about subversion in the Persian Gulf                        and the maintenance of Pakistan integrity the Shah referred to a recent                        conversation between Marshal Grechko                        and the Iranian War Minister during which Grechkos queries about Irans purchase of arms from the                        United States were greeted with the comment that one may only pursue a                        policy of peace from a position of strength To this Marshal Grechko was obliged to agree The Shah                        pointed out that the stronger his country becomes the wiser his policies                        are permitted to be He noted to the Secretary that he told Kosygin that Iran could crush Iraq in a                        few hours a fact of life which kept Iraq from adventures against Iran He                        feels that the only thing which keeps Iraq from shelling the Abadan refinery                        or other depredations is the knowledge of what Iran could do in retaliation                        He alluded to a point which he had covered in greater detail in an earlier                        conversation with the Ambassador that is Iran can afford arms purchases on                        the scale envisaged because it is spending as much money as makes sense on                        domestic development As an example the Shah pointed out that if he were to                        take money from the military to build hospitals he could not find or train                        the doctors and nurses to man the hospitals He said that there are 1200                        Iranian doctors presently in West Germany who have been trained there and                        who like the bright lights and blond girls He feels that they will                        gradually come back to Iran but there is no way of forcing them at the                        moment In addition there are 4000 Iranian nurses in New York City alone                        and he points out there is no country known to him which has enough nurses                        at present therefore he would not be able to import them if he wanted to                        Put another way the Shah believes that two years of military training                        either on direct military work or in the health and literacy corps                        inculcates a kind of discipline which the young people of his country                        need5 The Secretary and the Shah discussed military aid to Pakistan They agreed                        that the Pakistan Armed Forces were a Russian salad made up of US                        British French Chinese and Russian equipment The Shah expressed the hope                        that the US would send arms directly to Pakistan the Secretary commenting                        that this was better than sending them through third countries like Iran                        FYI:

assistance in retrofitting its                        tanks which can be done in Iran The Secretary mentioned that USG had approved the sale of Iranian C130s                        to Pakistan The

attempting a revengeful war                        against India The Secretary and he discussed the possibility of POW trial                        and the bad blood which this would engender Although Iran will not                        recognize Bangladesh until Pakistan does the Shah feels that a tripartite                        meeting without preconditions is the best way to proceed towards

with Lebanon                        Jordan the Sudan and even with Algeria It is doing everything it can to                        create a real impression of evenhandedness including maintaining regular                        contacts with the Egyptians The Shah indicated that there is no other way                        The Secretary further pointed out that both Israel and Egypt trust the                        United States and that we still have hopes of being able to accomplish                        something The Shah indicated that he would be glad to have Amb Hoveyda at the UN get in                        touch with Amb Scali to see if there is any way in which                        Iran can be helpful in New York at getting talks going8 The Secretary then queried whether the Shah would agree that CENTO is now a more useful vehicle than                        ever Noting that the Pakistanis want CENTO to help against India the Secretary indicated that this                        was not possible but that CENTO could be                        used to strengthen and provide support to Pakistan The Shah expressed                        agreement then stated that CENTO will                        become important in the Indian Ocean area as Iran becomes a naval power of                        increasing size This in his view should establish a deterrent in the Indian                        Ocean particularly when Iran has longlegged Phantoms air to surface                        missiles on her planes and a refueling capability to cover the area almost                        as far as Diego Garcia The Shah then noted that Iran has relations with                        South Africa and that General Frazer former Chief of Staff is coming to                        Iran as South African Consul General He concluded by again agreeing with                        the Secretary that CENTO has an                        increasingly important role to play9 Shah did not

to attend the CENTO Ministerial meeting June 811Following is approved summary of Secretarys June 9 meeting with Shah of Iran                        in Tehran:Summary: The Secretary accompanied by Sisco and Helms had hour and forty minutes audience with Shah on 9                        June Subjects covered ranged widely to include Shahs recent trip dtente                        in Europe oil and gas Pakistan and the Subcontinent IranIraq relations                        US arms to Saudi Arabia and Kuwait ArabIsraeli impasse and CENTO and its relationship to Indian Ocean                        Greece was not discussed1 After photographs and normal amenities Shah touched on his recent trip                        devoting some minutes to Yugoslavia which he believes has the possibility of                        becoming an important European country in the next five years or so He                        remarked on how fit Tito appeared and referred to his energy as amazing                        in man of his age He and Secretary exchanged views about Romania and its                        leadership after which Shah mentioned that Bulgaria appears most tightly                        tied to Soviet Union of East Bloc countries he has visited He noted                        Bulgarias development of a reasonably sophisticated electronics                        industry2 After touching on the necessity of family planning in Iran with a current                        population of 31 million 50 percent of which is 15 years of age or under                        Shah passed on to a discussion of dtente in Europe between the United                        States and the Soviet Union He noted that the risk the US runs is in being                        obliged to bring American troops home The Secretary pointed out that the                        danger for the Soviets lay in opening up their society to the extent which                        was required by this dtente He also expressed his concerns about                        Congressional attitudes with respect to the maintenance of American troops                        in Western Europe The Shah noted his opinion that once the United States                        gets out of Europe it will never send military forces back there whereas                        the Soviets can always be back in Central and Western Europe within 24                        hours He then mentioned his talks with Heath and Brandt along the lines that peace in Europe                        is directly linked with the situation in the Middle East As he puts it if                        a regular supply of oil does not flow to Europe from the Middle East Europe                        could collapse without firing a shot He feels that both Heath and Brandt have got the message ie that                        something must be done to bring about a resolution of the ArabIsraeli                        stalemate3 At this juncture the Secretary congratulated the Shah on the signing of                        the oil agreement on May 24See footnote 4 Document 10 The Shah                        expressed his pleasure at the outcome and noted that Iran and West Germany                        are negotiating an arrangement whereby 500000 barrels per day of Iranian                        refined products will be sold to Western Germany He then spoke of Irans                        gas resources stating Iran has twice as much gas as all of the Arab states                        combined Thought is being given to building a pipeline to the Turkish                        border and on to Iskenderun A more ambitious project would have this gas pipeline continue on to Europe                        through Yugoslavia Trieste and branching out from there to Western Europe                        He noted certain conversations with Jamieson of Exxon about the possibility of piping Saudi                        Arabian gas to Iran and hitching it into such a pipeline There is no doubt                        that the Shah is more pleased about his arrangements on gas in the new                        agreement with the consortium than on any other aspect He is pushing the                        sale of LNG to Japan and the United                        States4 After expressing his wellknown views about subversion in the Persian Gulf                        and the maintenance of Pakistan integrity the Shah referred to a recent                        conversation between Marshal Grechko                        and the Iranian War Minister during which Grechkos queries about Irans purchase of arms from the                        United States were greeted with the comment that one may only pursue a                        policy of peace from a position of strength To this Marshal Grechko was obliged to agree The Shah                        pointed out that the stronger his country becomes the wiser his policies                        are permitted to be He noted to the Secretary that he told Kosygin that Iran could crush Iraq in a                        few hours a fact of life which kept Iraq from adventures against Iran He                        feels that the only thing which keeps Iraq from shelling the Abadan refinery                        or other depredations is the knowledge of what Iran could do in retaliation                        He alluded to a point which he had covered in greater detail in an earlier                        conversation with the Ambassador that is Iran can afford arms purchases on                        the scale envisaged because it is spending as much money as makes sense on                        domestic development As an example the Shah pointed out that if he were to                        take money from the military to build hospitals he could not find or train                        the doctors and nurses to man the hospitals He said that there are 1200                        Iranian doctors presently in West Germany who have been trained there and                        who like the bright lights and blond girls He feels that they will                        gradually come back to Iran but there is no way of forcing them at the                        moment In addition there are 4000 Iranian nurses in New York City alone                        and he points out there is no country known to him which has enough nurses                        at present therefore he would not be able to import them if he wanted to                        Put another way the Shah believes that two years of military training                        either on direct military work or in the health and literacy corps                        inculcates a kind of discipline which the young people of his country                        need5 The Secretary and the Shah discussed military aid to Pakistan They agreed                        that the Pakistan Armed Forces were a Russian salad made up of US                        British French Chinese and Russian equipment The Shah expressed the hope                        that the US would send arms directly to Pakistan the Secretary commenting                        that this was better than sending them through third countries like Iran                        FYI: Secretary was referring to present limited policy End FYI The Shah                        assumed that Pakistan requires spare                        parts transport in the form of C130s and assistance in retrofitting its                        tanks which can be done in Iran The Secretary mentioned that USG had approved the sale of Iranian C130s                        to Pakistan The Shah replied that he had so informed Bhutto on his recent visit to Tehran but                        had had no reply about this sale from him as yet The Shah then stated that                        he was doing his best to make a bridge between Pakistan and India He                        pointed out that he had told Bhutto                        that there was no point in the Pakistanis attempting a revengeful war                        against India The Secretary and he discussed the possibility of POW trial                        and the bad blood which this would engender Although Iran will not                        recognize Bangladesh until Pakistan does the Shah feels that a tripartite                        meeting without preconditions is the best way to proceed towards sorting out                        the subcontinent Both he and the Secretary noted that it would be useful if                        the British would reassure the Pakistanis by some gesture which would dull                        the impression that Britain is only behind India6 The conversation turned to the Persian Gulf The Shah queried as to how                        Iran can help Kuwait if Kuwait does not request it After reiterating his                        relief that the superpowers should stay out of the Gulf he turned to the                        dispute between Saudi Arabia and Abu Dhabi and indicated it was the last                        serious one in that part of the area He opined that the Saudis should do                        more to be helpful to North Yemen Oman and Kuwait The Secretary and he                        discussed the sale of F4s to Saudi Arabia and to Kuwait the Shah                        repeating his position that he had no objection to this development Both                        the Secretary and he agreed that Saudi Arabia was very slow at reaching                        decisions The US offer of a month ago to sell Phantoms being evidence of                        this since no firm reply has as yet been received from the Saudis Sisco described his hearing before the                            HFAC during which he explained the                        Iranian military buildupOn June 6 Sisco testified before the House                            Foreign Affairs Committee which was holding hearings on US interests                            in and policy toward the Persian Gulf US arms sales to Persian Gulf                            countries and the current status of IsraeliArab relations For

 Committee on Foreign Affairs 93rd Congress pp 134                            19737 The Shah then asked the Secretary what could be done to keep Sadat from                        committing suicide ie going to war The Shah stressed his oftmade                        recommendation that the Rogers Plan be reactivated in some form since                            Zayyat had told him Egypt will                        accept the Rogers Plan The Secretary pointed out that the Egyptians                        sometimes do not seem to understand what the Rogers Plan entails He                        indicated that nothing could now be done until after the Security Council                        debate on the Middle East He stressed that the United States was prepared                        to do anything it could to bring about direct or indirect talks between                        Egypt and Israel The Shah agreed but                        stated again that some proposal must be brought forward which does not seem                        onesided in favor of the Israelis He expressed the hope that the United                        States would pursue a more evenhanded policy in the area The Secretary                        pointed out that this was what the United States was trying to do and                        indicated that the United States has good relations these days

                     United States and that we still have hopes of being able to accomplish                        something The Shah indicated that he would be glad to have Amb Hoveyda at the UN get

DURING AMEETING WITH MINISTER OF COURT ALAM ON ANOTHER MATTER,  THE AMBASSADOR MENTIONED THERE HAD  BEEN MUCH SPECULATION RECENTLY THAT DEPUTY MINISTER FOR POLITICAL AFFAIRS FARTAKH WAS NOT ILL AS REPORTED BUT WAS IN BAGHDAD IN FURTHER PURSUIT OF TALKS INITIATED BY FOREIGN MINISTER KHALATBARI IN GENEVA ( TEHRAN 2990).  ALAM SAID THIS WAS NOT TRUE. NO TALKS WERE GOING ON AND NONE APPEARED LIKELY IN THE NEAR FUTURE.\n2.  IN RESPONSE TO THE AMBASSADOR S QUERY AS TO WHETHER IRAN AND IRAQ MIGHT NOT TACKLE SOME OF THEIR LESS PRICKLY PROBLEMS NOW AND LEAVE THE TOUGHER ONES FOR SOME TIME IN THE FUTURE,  ALAM SAID THAT THIS WAS THE COURSE HE PREFERRED BUT THE SHAH DISAGREED.  THE SHAH HAD DECIDED TO PLAY IT TOUGH FOR THE MOMENT AND INSIST ON IRAQI ACCEPTANCE OF DRAWING THEIR COMMON  CONFIDENTIAL\n3.  IN REFLECTING ON IRAQ S RELATIONS WITH THE USSR, ALAM SAID THAT HE PERSONALLY FELT THE IRAQIS WERE TRYING TO PUT A BIT OF LIGHT BETWEEN THEMSELVES AND THE SOVIETS.

COMMUNIST WEEKLY AL- FIKR AL- JADID AND KDP AL TAAXHI PUBLISHED IDENTICAL ARTICLE JUN 23  STATING THAT ICP DELEGATION HEADED BY FIRST SEC OF CENTRAL COMMITTEE AZIZ MOHAMMAD HAD MET WITH MUSTAFA BARZANI AT HIS HDQS ON JUN 19.  STATEMENT SAID TWO PARTIES HAD CONCLUDED THAT IRAQ FACING GREAT DANGER FROM IMPERIALISTS AND THAT TO MEET IT REQUIRED ( A)  NATIONAL UNITY THROUGH IMPLEMENTATION OF MAR 1970  MANIFESTO AND SAFEGUARDING RIGHTS OF MINORITIES;  AND ( B)  CREATION OF NATIONAL FRONT AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE.  AL- FIKR AL- JADID COMMENTED EDITORIALLY BY PRAISING MEETING AS NEW STEP TOWARD ACCELERATING ESTABLISHMENT OF NATIONAL FRONT AND DEFEATING EFFORTS OF REACTIONARY ELEMENTS TRYING TO EXPLOIT DIFFERENCES AND SOWING  CONFIDENTIAL\n2.  COMMENT:  THIS MEETING ALMOST CERTAINLY HAD APPROVAL OF BAATH,  WHO ARE PRESUMABLY ATTEMPTING TO USE COMMUNIST INFLUENCE WITHIN KDP -  AND THEIR STRONG INTEREST INFORMATION OF NATIONAL FRONT -  TO PRESSURE BARZANI TO COMPROMISE ON DEMANDS FOR AUTONOMY.  THERE IS,  HOWEVER,  INCREASING EVIDENCE OF DIVERGENCE BETWEEN ICP AND BAATH OVER KURDISH ISSUE. BAATHIST LEADERS ARE BELIEVED TO VIEW KURDISH PROBLEM AS REGIME S MAJOR REMAINING WEAK SPOT AND TO BE DETERMINED TO RESOLVE IT.  LONDON OBSERVER CORRESPONDENT GAVIN YOUNG,  WHO  RECENTLY SPENT SEVERAL WEEKS HERE AT INVITATION OF GOI,  SAID MINISTERS ALL STRESSED THEIR DETERMINATION TO RESOLVE ISSUE AND HAD INDICATED WILLINGNESS TO REACH DETENTE WITH IRAN AS NECESSARY TO KURDISH SETTLEMENT.  COMMUNIST LEADERS,  ON OTHER HAND,  HAD APPEARED MORE RELAXED ABOUT KURDS AND THREAT FROM IRAN.  THEY CITED LONG IRANIAN BORDER WITH USSR WHICH MEANT USSR COULD PRESSURE IRAN WHENEVER REQUIRED TO PROTECT IRAQ.\n3.  ALTHOUGH MANY PIECES OF PUZZLE OBVIOUSLY MISSING,  IT APPEARS THAT COMMUNISTS DO NOT WANT TO SEE BAATH RESOLVE KURDISH ISSUE AND ACHIEVE DETENTE WITH IRAN ON THEIR OWN,  SINCE THIS WOULD FURTHER STRENGTHEN BAAATHIST POWER MONOPLY.  IF,  HOWEVER, COMMUNISTS CAN BRING ABOUT KURDISH SETTLEMENT,  THEIR PRICE WILL BE GREATER ROLE IN NATIONAL FRONT.\n4.  FRENCH AMB CERLES HAS REPORT,  IN ADDITION TO THAT CONTAINED IN REFTEL,  THAT BAATHISTS ARE BEING TOLD BY SOURCES UNKNOWN THAT SHAH FAVORS DETENTE WITH IRAQ BUT WESTERN POWERS HAVE DISSUADED HIM,  PRESUMABLY TO CONTAIN "" REVOLUTIONARY""  VIEWS FROM SPREADING.  THIS RUMOR WAS GIVEN CREDIBILITY BY HEAVY COVERAGE OF CENTO MEETING AND EMPHASIS ON COMBATTING "" SUBVERSION"".\n5.  CONSENSUS OF DIPLOMATS HERE IS THAT BAATH REGIME IS SERIOUS IN SEEKING DETENTE WITH IRAQN IN ORDER TO RESOLVE KURDISH PROBLEM AND CONCENTRATE ON RAPID DEVELOPMENT OF PETROLEUM SECTOR AFTER 10  YEARS OF NEAR STAGNATION.  I REALIZE DEPT AND EMBASSY TEHRAN MAY HAVE INFO WHICH CONTRIDICTS SOME OF ABOVE . IF NOT,  HOWEVER,  I BELIEVE IT WOULD BE HELPFUL IN  CONFIDENTIAL\n",913672

RUMANIAN CHARGE TOLD ME JUNE 16  THAT GDR,  SOVIET AND CZECH CULTURAL CENTERS REMAIN CLOSED,  BUT BOTH SIDES ARE PREPARED TO NEGOTIATE DIFFERENCES.  HE SAID CZECHS CLAIM THEY ARE GOING TO GRANT RECIPROCITY.  MOST OBSERVERS NOW BELIEVE THAT CLOSURE OF CENTERS RESULTED FROM IRAQI DESIRE TO ASSERT SOVEREIGNITY THROUGH STRICT IMPLEMENTATION OF 1972  LAW GOVERNING CULTURAL RELATIONS AND RELATED DESIRE TO CURTAIL WIDESPREAD ACTIVITIES OF COMMUNIST CULTURAL CENTERS.  LARGE FRENCH CENTER AND BRITISH COUNCIL HAVE NOT BEEN DISTURBED BECAUSE OF WILLINGNESS TO GRANT  CONFIDENTIAL\n2.  ALTHOUGH CLOSURE OF COMMUNIST CENTERS MAY NOT HAVE SERIOUS REPERCUSSIONS ON SUBSTANCE OF IRAQ S RELATIONS WITH USSR AND SOCIALIST COUNTRIES,  IT DOES SEEM TO HAVE HAD PSYCHOLOGICAL IMPACT.  INDIAN EMBOFF SAID RUSSIAN CHARGE HAD ADMITTED THAT SOVIETS WERE SURPRISED BY IRAQI MOVE,  BUT THAT IT WAS MATTER THAT COULD BE RESOLVED.  CHARGE ALSO SAID THAT AMBASSADOR LIKHACHEV HAD RECOMMENDED AN EARLY VISIT TO IRAQ OF FOREIGN MINISTER GROMYKO.  FRENCH AMBASSADOR TOLD ME THAT BULGARIAN AMBASSADOR HAD COMPLAINED TO HIM THAT IRAQ WAS UNGRATEFUL TO SOCIALIST COUNTRIES.  HE WAS PARTICULARLY BITTER ABOUT TERMINATION OF BARTER FOR OIL AND THAT IRAQ WAS CHARGING WESTERN OIL COMPANIES LESS FOR OIL THAN SOCIALIST COUNTRIES.  FRENCH AMBASSADOR ALSO HAS UNCONFIRMED REPORT THAT USSR DISPLEASED WITH TERMINATION OF OIL BARTER AND THAT THEY REPORTEDLY TOLD GOI THAT IF THEY MUST PAY HARD CURRENCY,  THEN IRAQIS MUST ALSO PAY FOR MILITARY AND OTHER EQUIPMENT WITH HARD CURRENCY.  AS RESULT COMPLEX STRUCTURE OF ECONOMIC AND MILITARY AID ACCORDS WITH USSR IS IN DANGER OF FALLING APART. LOWRIE\n",916809

AS EMBASSY IS AWARE,  EXIMBANK ON DECEMBER 12,  1972,  RE- ISSUED ITS PRELIMINARY COMMITMENT LETTER NO.  1738  TO ACERIAS PAZ DEL RIO S. A.  TO ASSIST IN FINANCING UP TO DOLS 25  MILLION OF U. S.  GOODS AND SERVICES FOR A PROJECT FOR THE INSTALLATION OF A COLD MILL FOR ROLLED STEEL PRODUCTS.  THE PC EXPIRED ON APRIL 30,  1973,  WITHOUT A REQUEST FROM PAZ DEL RIO FOR ITS EXTENSION.\n2.  EXIMBANK CONTINUES TO RECEIVE INQUIRIES ABOUT FINANCING FROM PROSPECTIVE U. S.  SUPPLIERS OF ONE OR MORE ELEMENTS FOR THE PROJECT.  REPORTS REACHING EXIM FROM SUPPLIERS ARE TO THE EFFECT THAT REPUBLIC STEEL IS WORKING WITH PAZ DEL RIO  LIMITED OFFICIAL USE\n3.  AMONG THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THE PC WERE THE RE- QUIREMENT OF THE GUARANTEE OF THE REPUBLIC OF COLOMBIA.  THIS APPARENTLY CAUSED SOME UNEASINESS FOR PAZ DEL RIO,  WHICH WROTE EXIM ON DECEMBER 26,  1972,  ASKING WHETHER THERE WAS ANY POSSIBILITY THAT THE BANK WOULD WAIVE THE GUARANTEE REQUIRE- MENT.  IN A TELEXED REPLY MADE ON JANUARY 9,  1973,  EXIM TOLD PAZ DEL RIO THAT THE BANK WOULD BE GLAD TO REVIEW THE RE- QUIREMENT AND REQUESTED CERTAIN SPECIFIC FINANCIAL INFORMATION FROM PAZ DEL RIO AS A BASIS FOR RECONSIDERATION .  MOREOVER, EXIM SAID THAT IT WOULD BE GLAD TO CONSIDER ANY SPECIFIC PROPOSAL PAZ DEL RIO MIGHT WISH TO MAKE IN DETAIL BY WHICH THE BANK S FINANCING COULD BE ADEQUATELY SECURED WITHOUT THE GUARANTEE OF THE REPUBLIC OF COLOMBIA.  IN RESPONSE,  PAZ DEL RIO MERELY SENT TO EXIM WITHOUT TRANSMITTAL COVER COPIES OF PUBLISHED RECENT ANNUAL REPORTS. FOR THE MOST PART THE REPORTS SUBMITTED WERE ALREADY AVAILABLE TO EXIM AND SCARCELY CONSTITUTED THE INFORMATION THE BANK HOPED TO RECEIVE AS A BASIS FOR RECONSIDERATION OF THE GUARANTEE RE - QUIREMENT.  NO ALTERNATIVE PROPOSAL WAS MADE AS INVITED BY EXIM.\n4.  IN VIEW OF THE CONTINUED INTEREST ON THE PART OF  U. S. SUPPLIERS EXIMBANK WOULD BE GLAD TO CONSIDER A REQUEST FROM OR ON BEHALF OF PAZ DEL RIO FOR AN APPROPRIATE EXTENSION OF THE EXPIRY DATE OF THE PC.  SUCH A REQUEST SHOULD INCLUDE,  AS A MINIMUM,  A REPORT ON THE CURRENT STATUS OF THE PROJECT AND AN ESTIMATE AS TO THE TIME WHEN THE EVALUATION OF THE BIDS WILL BE COMPLETED AND CONTRACTS AWARDED.  IT SHOULD ALSO DEAL WITH THE AMOUNT OF THE U. S.  FINANCING INVOLVED AND CLEARLY INDICATE WHETHER THE DOLS 25  MILLION ESTIMATED AMOUNT SHOULD BE INCREASED OR DECREASED.\n5.  EXIMBANK WOULD APPRECIATE THE EMBASSY RAISING THE EXTEN- SION MATTER WITH PAZ DEL RIO.  THE QUESTION OF THE GUARANTEE WILL IN ALL LIKELIHOOD ALSO ARISE.  EXIM REMAINS PREPARED TO RECONSIDER THE MATTER AND SUGGESTS THAT THE EMBASSY POINT OUT TO PAZ DEL RIO THAT THE COPIES OF THE ANNUAL REPORTS WERE NOT SUFFICIENTLY RESPONSIVE TO THE DETAILS SET FORTH IN EXIM S TELEX OF LAST JANUARY.  AS FOR AN ALTERNATIVE PROPOSAL, A RECENT TELEX FROM ECGD IN LONDON,  SENT TO EXIM,  HERMES IN GERMANY,  AND MITI IN JAPAN,  SUGGESTS A POSSIBILITY.  ECGD ASKED EXIM WHETHER IT WOULD CONSIDER AN OFFER OF THE GUAR- ANTEE OF INSTITUTO DE FOMENTO INDUSTRIAL ( IFI)  ISSUED WITH THE APPROVAL OF THE MINISTRY OF FINANCE AND BANCO DE LA REPUBLICA.  AS THE BANK REPLIED TO ECGD,  WHILE NO SUCH PROPOSAL HAD NOT BEEN MADE TO IT BY PAZ DEL RIO IT WOULD RE- CEIVE SERIOUS CONSIDERATION IF MADE.  THIS POSSIBILITY MAY ALSO BE BROACHED TO PAZ DEL RIO BY THE EMBASSY BUT WITH- OUT IDENTITY OF ECGD AS THE SOURCE.  RUSH\n",916926

LEBRUN SAID HE HAD UNDERSTOOD REPRISALS IN BURUNDI HAD LARGELY SUBSIDED AND THAT NEWSPAPER REPORTS BASED LARGELY ON REFUGEE TESTIMONY WHICH SOMEWHAT DATED.  HE HAD NOT KNOWN OF REPORTED MILITARY OPERATION TO CLEAR MOSSO REGION. LEBRUN AGREED NEVERTHELESS THAT SITUATION WERE IN BURUNDI POTENTIALLY EXPLOSIVE AND SAID BELGIANS ARE PARTICULARLY CON- CERNED OVER POSSIBILITY THAT SITUATION COULD LEAD TO ARMED CONFLICT BETWEEN RWANDA AND BURUNDI.\n2.  LEBRUN PRAISED US INITIATIVE BUT WAS HIGHLY SKEPTICAL THAT OAU WOULD TAKE ANY ACTION RE BRUUNDI.  HE NOTED THAT RECENT OAU SUMMIT HAD SIDESTEPPED ISSUE.  HE EXPRESSED DOUBT THAT BURUNDI WOULD ALLOW ANY KIND OF UN PRESENCE.  LEBRUN SAID BEST HOPE FOR INFLUENCE ON GRB WAS THROUGH MAJOR AFRICAN LEADERS, O PARTICULARLY MOBUTU,  AND CONSIDERED APPROACH TO MOBUTU AS MOST IMPORTANT STEP USG HAD TAKEN.  LEBRUN FELT ALSO THAT US SHOULD CONSIDER SIMILAR APPROACH TO GOWON,  PARTICULARLY SINCE HE IS NEW OAU PRESIDENT.  LEBRUN CAUTIONED,  HOWEVER, HTHAT MOBTUT SHOULD BE INFORMED OF ANY SUCH APPROACH BECAUSE OF MOBUTU S RIVALRY WITH GOWON FOR AFRICAN LEADERSHIP.  FOR LONG TERM,  BECAUSE OF RIVALRY AMONG TUTSIS,  LEBRUN FORESAW NO SOLUTION UNTIL EXTREMISTS ("" LES DURS"")  SUCH AS SIMBANANIYE REMOVED FROM POWER.\n3.  BELGIAN GOVERNMENT DOES NOT NOW PLAN TO TAKE MEASURES TO PROMOTE SOLUTION IN BURUNDI.  LEBRUN STRESSED THAT SUCH INITIATIVE MIGHT BE COUNTERPRODUCTIVE BECAUSE BELGIUM SUSPECT IN EYES OF GRB.

NEWSOM SAID THAT RELATIONS BETWEEN THE US AND BURUNDI COULD NOT IMPROVE UNTIL THE GRB CEASED INDESCRIMINATE KILLING AND BEGAN A PROGRAM ON NATIONAL RECONCILIATION.  MR.

HE SAID WE RE VERY AWARE OF THE COMPLEXITY OF PROBLEMS IN BURUNDI BUT THAT DID NOT EXCUSE WHAT WAS TAKING PLACE. B.  HE SAID WE WERE AWARE OF WHAT WAS GOING ON IN BURUNDI WITH REGARD TO KILLINGS BY THE JRR AND THE ARMY. THERE WERE TO MANY REPORTS FROM TOO MANY SOURCES FOR THEM TO BE DENIED. C.  MANY COUNTRIES IN AFRICA HAVE HAD PROBLEMS BUT ONLY BURUNDI RESORTED TO MASSIVE SLAUGHTER IN REPRISAL. D.  THE GRB MUST ADMIT THEY HAVE A PROBLEM AND QUIT DENYING WHAT HAS HAPPENED AS SUCH DENIAL ONLY SERVES TO FURTHER DISCREDIT THE GRB AND PRECLUDE ANY CONSTRUCTIVE STEPS BY IT. E.  GRB SHOULD INVITE IN OUTSIDE OBSERVERS TO HELP PREVENT OUTSIDE INCURSIONS AND TO TELL ITS SIDE OF THE STORY.  HE CITED RECENT REFUSALS OF VISAS TO JOURNALISTS. F.  AFRICAN INACTION TOWARD ACTIONS SUCH HAVE TAKEN PLACE IN BURUNDI ARE GIVING ALL OF AFRICA A BAD NAME IN THE US AND HURTING OUR EFFORTS TO DEAL WITH PROBLEMS ELSE- WHERE IN AFRICA. G.  THE USG IS AND WILL CONTINUE TO ENCOURAGE AFRICAN LEADERSHIP TO PAY ATTENTION TO BURUNDI JUST AS THEY DO TO INJUSTICE WHITE RULED SOUTHERN AFRICA FOR TO FAIL TO DO SOLESSENS THEIR CREDIBILITY AND INTEGRITY AS AFRICAN LEADERS.  LIMITED OFFICIAL USE\n4.  COMMENT:  DURING THE CONVERSATION THE BURUNDI AMBASSADOR CONTINUED TO PLACE THE BLAME FOR THE STRIFE IN BURUNDI ON FOREIGN ELEMENTS AND DISSIDENTS.  HE SAID THAT THE PRESS REPORTAGE WAS ONE SIDED AND THAT WE DID NOT UNDERSTAND THE SITUATION.  THE USG POSITION WAS CLEARLY STATED THAT WE DO UNDERSTAND THE PROBLEMS OF BURUNDI BUT THAT THE GRB MUST TAKE THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR WHAT IT DOES AND SEEK TO FIND A SOLUTION.  THE USG WAS NOT TRYING TO ALIENATE AFRICAN LEADERS FROM BURUNDI BUT RATHER THAT WE FELT AFRICAN LEADERS MUST TAKE A STAND AGAINST ALL INJUSTICE TO MAINTAIN CREDIBILITY. THE AMBASSADOR SAID HE WOULD FAITHFULLY REPORT OUR POSITION TO HIS GOVERNMENT.    ROGERS\n",915350

AFTERNOON JUNE 4 LAY OUT                            PROPOSED SCENARIO SOBER,frus1969-76ve08d128,"1.  SUMMARY:  BHUTTO IS CONCERNED OVER THE NEED TO FIND SOME SOLUTION FOR CURRENT UNSTABLE POLITICAL SITUATION IN BALUCHISTAN.  RECENT VIOLENCE THERE,  WHICH LED TO CENTRAL GOVERNMENT S INTRODUCTION OF SOME ARMY UNITS,  HAS COMPLICATED PROBLEM OF FINDING SATISFACTORY ACCOMMODATION. ANOTHER PROBLEM IS SNIPING BY NAP LEADERS AT SHAH S ALLEGED INTERFERENCE IN PAK DOMESTIC AFFAIRS,  WHICH BHUTTO DIS- CUSSED DURING RECENT VISIT TO IRAN.  BHUTTO ANTICIPATES THAT NEW CONSTITUTION WILL TAKE EFFECT ON AUGUST 14.  MEAN- WHILE,  HE APPEARS TO BE CHANGING HIS MIND ON EARLIER INTENTION TO CALL FOR NEW GENERAL ELECTIONS THIS SUMMER.  HE EXPRESSED CONTINUING CONCERN OVER HEAVY BURDEN OF PAK MILITARY EXPENDITURE.  END SUMMARY\n1.  MORNING AFTER OUR RETURN FROM LEAVE IN INDIA,  PRES BHUTTO SENT WORD INVITING MY WIFE AND ME TO HAVE DINNER WITH HIM AND BEGUM BHUTTO THAT SAME EVENING JUNE 3  AT PRESIDENT S HOUSE IN NATHIAGALI HILL STATION. ( BHUTTOS  CONFIDENTIAL\n2.  BHUTTO OPENED CONVERSATION BY NOTING HIS MAJOR CONCERN IS OVER SITUATION IN BALUCHISTAN.  PASSAGE OF CONSTITUTION HAD BEEN GREAT STEP.  SINCE THEN,  A QTE NATURAL MAJORITY UNQTE HAD EVOLVED IN SUPPORT OF PRESENT PROVINCIAL GOVERN- MENT IN NWFP,  WHERE PREVIOUS NAP/ JUI COALITION HAD LOST CONSIDERABLE STRENGTH IN PROVINCIAL ASSEMBLY,  WALI KHAN ( NAP CHIEF)  WAS CONTINUING HIS SHARP ATTACKS ON BHUTTO REGIME ( AS WELL AS ON ALLEGED IRANIAN INFLUENCE ON BHUTTO) BUT BHUTTO THOUGHT HIS BARK DID NOT HAVE MUCH BITE AS REGARDS NWFP.  BALUCHISTAN WAS DIFFERENT MATTER.  NEW PROVINCIAL GOVERNMENT THERE UNDER GOVERNOR BUGTI AND CHIEF MINISTER JAM SAHIB OF LASBELA,   WHICH REPLACED EARLIER NAP- LED GOVERNMENT,  HAD NOT BEEN ABLE ESTABLISH ITSELF AS FIRMLY AS BHUTTO HAD HOPED.  PROVINCIAL GOVERNMENT WITH SUPPORT OF PPP WAS STILL NEGOTIATING,  BHUTTO VOLUNTEERED,  TO WIN OVER SOME NAP MEMBERS OF PROVINCIAL ASSEMBLY WHO WERE HOLDING OUT FOR RATHER HIGH PRICE.  BHUTTO ESTIMATED THAT AT THIS MOMENT PRESENT GOVERNMENT WOULD BE SHORT OF MAJORITY BY TWO SEATS IF VOTE OF CONFIDENCE WERE TAKEN IN PRIVINCIAL ASSEMBLY.  LARGELY TO PLAY FOR MORE TIME BEFORE SHOWDOWN ON VOTE,  BUDGET SESSION OF BALUCHISTAN ASSEMBLY WOULD NOT MEET UNTIL JUNE 22,  SOME TWO- THREE WEEKS LATER THAN WOULD ORDINARILY BE EXPECTED.\n3.  BHUTTO COMPLAINED THAT POLITICAL SITUATION IN BALUCHIS- TAN,  WHICH WAS ALREADY DIFFICULT ENOUGH,  HAD BEEN COMPLI- CATED BY VIOLENCE RESORTED TO BY ELEMENTS OPPOSED TO PRESENT GOVERNMENT.  HE MENTIONED UNPROVOKED SHOOTING OF EIGHT MEMBERS OF DIR SCOUTS JUST OVER TWO WEEKS AGO AND ALSO AN INCREASE IN VIOLENCE BY MENGAL TRIBESMEN IN JHALAWAN AREA. CENTRAL GOVERNMENT HAD HAD NO CHOICE,  HE SAID,  BUT TO DEPLOY SOME ARMY UNITS IN ATTEMPT TO MAINTAIN ORDER. ARMY HAD BEEN WELL RECEIVED AND HAD NOT HAD TO FIRE A SINGLE SHOT.  IN RESPONSE MY QUERY AS TO WHETHER PAK  CONFIDENTIAL\n4.  BHUTTO THEN RECOUNTED HIS NEGOTIATION WITH FORMER BALUCH GOVERNOR BIZENJO AND FORMER BALUCH CHIEF MINISTER MEGAL ( BOTH OF NAP)  NOT LONG BEFORE BHUTTO HAD DEPARTED ON VISIT TO IRAN IN MID- MAY.  PURPOSE HAD BEEN TO WORK OOT AMICABLE ARRANGEMENT INTENDED TO STABILIZE SITUATION IN PROVINCE.  UNDERSTANDING THEY REACHED AT THAT TIME WAS THAT A NEW COALITION GOVERNMENT,  HEADED BY NAP CHIEF MINISTER AND INCLUDING MEMBERSHIP FROM PPP AS WELL AS JUI,  WOULD REPLACE PRESENT MINISTRY LED BY JAM SAHIB. IN ADDITION,  GOVERNOR BUGTI ( WHO IS ANATHEMA TO NAP)  WOULD BE REPLACED BY SOMEONE ACCEPTABLE TO NAP AS WELL AS TO BHUTTO.  UNFORTUNATELY,  SINCE THEN,  NAP HAD MADE THINGS DIFFICULT BY INDULGING IN VIOLENCE AND ALSO IN SWIPES AT ALLEGED IRANIAN INFLUENCE ON BHUTTO AND ALLEGED INCLINATION OF SHAH TO INTERFERE IN PAK DOMESTIC POLITICS.\n5.  ON LATTER POINT,  BHUTTO RECALLED HAVING TOLD CHARGE BEFORE DEPARTING FOR IRAN VISIT,  THAT HE HAD BEEN SOME- WHAT SET BACK BY COMMENTS ON PAKISTAN ATTRIBUTED TO SHAH IN LATEST INTERVIEW WITH CY SULZBERGER.  HE SAID SHAH WAS ACCUSTOMED TO OPERATING IN POLITICAL CLIMATE SUCH AS EXISTS IN IRAN AND DID NOT SEEM TO UNDERSTAND PROBLEMS FACING BHUTTO IN DEALING WITH DOMESTIC OPPOSI- TION.  SHAH HAD EXPRESSED TO BHUTTO HIS CONCERN OVER NAP POLICIES AND INTENTIONS AND SEEMED TO THINK THAT BHUTTO COULD SIMPLY DISPOSE OF NAP LEADERSHIP SO THAT IT WOULD NO LONGER PRESENT PROBLEM.  BHUTTO SAID HE HAD SPOKEN AT SOME LENGTH TO SHAH,  EXPLAINING HIS OWN LIMITATIONS UNDER PAK POLITICAL SYSTEM AND URGING SHAH TO INVITE BIZENJO AND MANGAL TO VISIT IRAN SO THAT HE COULD SIZE THEM UP AND GIVE THEM BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF SHAH S SINCERE INTEREST IN WELL- BEING OF PAKISTAN.  BEFORE BHUTTO LEFT IRAN,  HE HAD IMPRESSION THAT SHAH WAS AGREEABLE TO THIS PROPOSAL.\n",916824

DELICATE                            EXERCISE HOWEVER THIS WAS NOT THE TYPE OF THING IN WHICH DIPLOMATS                             EVEN FRIENDLY DIPLOMATS  RAN INTO AS A NORMAL PART OF THEIR DUTIES                                BHUTTO ACKNOWLEDGED THAT HE                            HAD MADE AN EXTRAORDINARY REQUEST HE HAD DONE SO BECAUSE OUR                            RELATIONSHIP HAD ALWAYS BEEN FRANK AS WELL AS FRIENDLY HE RECALLED THAT                            IN 1971 I HAD COME TO HIM WITH A REQUEST FOR HELP AND HE HAD IMMEDIATELY                            OBLIGED REFERENCE WAS TO MY APPEAL THAT BHUTTO USE HIS INFLUENCE TO CALL OFF PPP SPOKESMEN AND                            PRESS WHO HAD BEEN ATTACKING AMBASSADOR FARLAND5 YOU WILL APPRECIATE THAT I FELT VERY MUCH ON THE SPOT I FELT I SHOULD                            MAKE A DECISION THERE AND THEN RATHER THAN FUDGE TO SAY NO THANKS                            WOULD HAVE BEEN DIPLOMATICALLY IMPECCABLE BUT WOULD SURELY HAVE REDUCED                            VERY SHARPLY WHATEVER VALUE I STILL HAVE HERE AS SENIOR US REP MORE                            THAN THAT IT SEEMED TO ME THAT BHUTTOS PROPOSAL WAS REASONABLY HONORABLE ALTHOUGH IT                            HAS ITS FAULTS AND IF IT PROVES TO BE ACCEPTABLE TO NAP COULD LEAD TO AN IMPORTANT                            ABATEMENT OF WHAT IS PERHAPS PAKISTANS MOST URGENT POLITICAL PROBLEM OF                            TODAY I THEREFORE TOLD BHUTTO                            THAT I WOULD UNDERTAKE TO REACH BIZENJO AND CONVEY BHUTTOS MESSAGE TO HIM WE AGREED CATEGORICALLY THAT I                            SHOULD UNDERTAKE NOTHING MORE THAN TO PASS THE MESSAGE TO BIZENJO AND TO RELAY TO BHUTTO ANY MESSAGE WHICH BIZENJO MIGHT WISH TO SEND THROUGH ME                            I SAID I WOULD MAKE IT AS CLEAR AS I COULD TO BIZENJO THAT MY AGREEMENT TO PLAYING                            THIS ROLE REFLECTED NOTHING MORE THAN MY INTEREST AND HOPE THAT THE                            VARIOUS CONCERNED ELEMENTS WOULD FIND A WAY TO RESOLVE A TROUBLESOME                            PROBLEM ALSO THAT I WAS ACTING IN A PURELY PERSONAL CAPACITY AS A

PARLIAMENTARY AFFAIRS MINISTER PIRZADA, POLITICAL AFFAIRS MINISTER JATOI,  AND SPECIAL ASSISTANT RAFI RAZA PARTICIPATED ON GOVERNMENT SIDE WITH BHUTTO. SERIES OF MEETINOS SIGNAL BHUTTO S CONCESSION OF DEFEAT IN EFFORTS TO BREAK NAP/ JUI POSITION IN BALUCHISTAN.\n2.  ALTHOUGH BOTH SIDES HAVE BEEN CLOSE- MOUTHED ABOUT TALKS, OBJECT IS CLEARLY TO FIND SOME COMPROMISEIWAY OUT OF EXTRA- LEGAL PARLIAMENTARY SITUATION PREVAILING IN BALUCHISTAN WHERE NAP- JUI COALITION HAS MAJORITY ( NOW REDUCED TO ONE) IN PROVINCIAL ASSEMBLY ALTHOUGH THREE- MAN PROVINCIAL MINISTRY IN HANDS OF PRO- BHUTTO GROUP.  ON JUNE 28,  BHUTTO MOVED TO SIDESTEP CONSTITUTIONAL NEED TO SUMMON ASSEMBLY TO PROVIDE AUTHORITY FOR GOVERNMENT SPENDING IN NEW FISCAL YEAR BY PROMULGATING CONSTITUTIONAL  AMENDMENT ORDINANCE GIVING GOVERNORS POWER TO "" AUTHENTICATE""  EXPENDITURE FOR NEXT FISCAL YEAR WHEN PROVINCIAL ASSEMBLIES NOT IN SESSION.  WHETHER BHUTTO TOOK THIS ACTION WITH ACQUIESENCE OF NAP LEADERS IS NOT KNOWN.  PRESISENT IS STILL UNDER PRESSURE TO PERMIT ASSEMBLY TO MEET,  HOWEVER,  SINCE INTERIM CONSTITUTION REQUIRES ASSEMBLY SESSION EVERY SIX MONTHS.  BALUCH ASSEMBLY ADJOURNED LAST ON JANUARY 12.  THEREFORE ASSEMBLY,  UNLESS DISSOLVED,  MUST MEET BEFORE JULY 13.\n3.  COMPROMISE EVIDENTLY BEING DISCUSSED PROBABLY INCLUDES FOLLOWING ELEMENTS:  NAP/ JUI GOVERNMENT WOULD BE RESTORED IN BALUCHISTAN BUT WITH ONE OR TWO PROVINCIAL MINISTERS  LIMITED OFFICIAL USE\n4.  ALTHOUGH PPP IN FRONTIER APPARENTLY CHAFING AT GOVERNOR KHATTAK  S ONE- MAN CONTROL OF PROVINCIAL MACHINERY OF GOVERNMENT,  EMBASSY NOT INCLINED TO BELIEVE BHUTTO WILL NOW ATTEMPT,  AS PART OF TALKS WITH NAP,  ANY MANEUVERS DESIGNED BRING DOWN KHATTAK UNITED FRONT CONTROLLED GOVERNMENT AND SUBSTITUTE NEW COALITION BUILT AROUND NAP/ JUI/ PPP.  SUCH MANEUVER WOULD ALSO NECESSITATE EXIT OF QAIYUM FROM GOVERN- MENT.\n5.  RESULTS OF LATEST ROUND OF NAP/ PPP TALKS WILL PRESUMABLY BE KNOWN IN FEW DAYS.  ALTHOUGH PAST RECORD LEAVES LITTLE ROOM FOR OPTIMISM THAT ANY COMPROMIST BETWEEN THE TWO PARTIES WILL ENDURE FOR LONG,  THERE ARE IMPORTANT POLITICAL COM- PULSIONS ON BHUTTO MAKING FOR AN EFFORT TO CLEAR THE POIITICAL DECKS AT THIS TIME.  TRANSPARENT POLITICAL MANI- PULATION IN BALUCHISTAN BY GOP,  NOT UNLIKE THAT OF PRE- MARTIAL LAW GOVERNMENTS,  HAS EVIDENTLY DAMAGED BHUTTO S CREDIBILITY AMONG MIDDLE CLASS.  MOREOVER,  MANY IN BHUTTO S OWN PARTY FROM SIND AND PUNJAB REPORTEDLY UNHAPPY AT LACK OF DEMONSTRABLE ACHIEVEMENTS BY PPP GOVERNMENT TO DATE.  RESOLUTION OF BALUCH CONFLICT WOULD FREE BHUTTO TO CONCENTRATE ON MORE CENTRAL PROBLEMS FACING HIM DOMESTICALLY:  RESTRUCTURING PEOPLES  PARTY,  PREVENTING EROSION OF HIS POSITION IN PUNJAB AND SIND,  COPING WITH  LIMITED OFFICIAL USE\n",912112

THIS MONTH OR IT COULD BE DONE IN ANY OTHER WAY THAT NAP WOULD PREFER                            SUCH AS ARRANGING THAT NAP MEMBERS OF PROVINCIAL ASSEMBLY WOULD NOT BE

WILLING TO ACCEPT OTHER POINTS OF BHUTTOS PROPOSAL WITHOUT BEING ABLE TO DIVULGE                            ARRANGEMENT IT WILL BE VERY HARD FOR THEM TO EXPLAIN ABSTENTION OR                            ANYTHING OTHER THAN STRAIGHT VOTE AGAINST EXISTING GOVERNMENT WHEN                            CONFIDENCE MOTION IS CALLED10 I FELT I SHOULD GIVE YOU THIS RATHER DETAILED ACCOUNT OF WHAT I HAVE                            ACCEPTED TO TRY TO DO I AM AWARE OF PITFALLS AND WILL TRY TO AVIOD                            THEM WILL KEEP YOU INFORMED11 HAVE ARRANGED FOR MEETING WITH BIZENJO AT MY HOUSE THIS AFTERNOON JUNE 4 LAY OUT                            PROPOSED SCENARIO SOBER,frus1969-76ve08d128,"8.  MATTERS CAME TO HEAD IN FINAL WEEK OF MAY,  WHEN LEADERS OF VARIOUS FACTIONS WERE SUMMONED TO RAWALPINDI TO MEET WITH BHUTTO.   IN THE MEANTIME,  KASHMIR IMBROGLIO HAD BEEN RAISED IN THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY TO OBVIOUS EMBARRASSMENT OF GOP WHICH ASSUMED,  PROBABLY CORRECTLY, THAT DIRTY LINEN BEING AIRED WOULD BE GLEEFULLY EXPLOITED BY INDIA.\n9.  ALTHOUGH DETAILS OF ANY AGREEMENT REACHED AS RESULT BHUTTO S INTERVENTION HAVE NOT BEEN ANNOUNCED, KASHMIR PRESIDENT QAYYUM TOLD PRESS MAY 31  HE WAS PREPARED TO QUIT HIS OFFICE SHOULD A NO- CONFIDENCE RESOLUTION BE PASSED.  HE DESCRIBED HIS MEETING WITH BHUTTO AS "" VERY CORDIAL"",  BUT SAID CATEGORICALLY THAT PEOPLES  PARTY SHOULD BE BANNED IN KASHMIR ALONG WITH JAMAAT- I- ISLAMI.  HE WAS ALSO HIGHLY CRITICAL OF ROLE OF CENTRAL KASHMIR AFFAIRS MINISTER QAIYUM IN ATTEMPTIING TO UNDERMINE KASHMIR GOVERNMENT.  HE ADDED THAT BHUTTO HAD ASSURED HIM DEMOCRATIC GOVERNMENT IN AZAD KASHMIR WOULD BE PERMITTED TO FUNCTION.\n1.  COMMENT:  OBSERVERS IN ISLAMABAD FIND IT DIFFICULT TO FATHOM GOP/ PEOPLES  PARTY EFFORTS TO DISLODGE QAYYUM GOVERNMENT AT THIS TIME,  GIVEN EXISTING POLITICAL PROBLEM IN BALUCHISTAN,  PEOPLES  PARTY INTERNAL DISPUTES, AND SENSITIVITY OF ALL MATTERS RELATING TO KASHMIR. BHUTTO MAY BE UNHAPPY AT MANNER IN WHICH SARDAR QAYYUM HAS USED WIDE POWERS GRANTED HIS GOVERNMENT BY 1970 KASHMIR CONSTITUTION TO RESIST DIRECTION FROM ISLAMABAD, AND DECIDED TO REMOVE HIM OR AT LEAST CUT HIM DOWN TO SIZE.  ALTERNATELY,  MOVES AGAINST QAYYUM GOVERNMENT MAY HAVE BEEN SPARKED BY BHUTTO S OVER- EAGER AIDES, WITH BHUTTO FORCED TO INTERVENE PERSONALLY WHEN THEIR ACTIVITIES BECAME PUBLIC.  JOURNALISTS ARE SAYING,  HOWEVER,  THAT INTERIOR AND KASHMIR AFFAIRS MINISTER QAIYUM KHAN IS GROUSING THAT BHUTTO INSTRUCTED HIM TO GET RID OF KASHMIR GOVERNMENT,  BUT BACKTRACKED WHEN AFFAIR BECAME HIGHLY PUBLIC,  LEAVING MINISTER TO TAKE THE BLAME.  ALTHOUGH IT IS UNCERTAIN WHETHER QAYYUM GOVERNMENT WILL REMAIN IN OFFICE,  AIRING OF VARIOUS GOP MANEUVERS AGAINST HIS POPULARLY ELECTED GOVERNMENT HAS EMBARRASSED BHUTTO DOMESTICALLY AND COULD PROVIDE USEFUL PROPAGANDA TOOL TO INDIA AS WELL AS TO HIS DOMESTIC OPPONENTS.

ISSUE HAS REMAINED IN BACKGROUND FOR MOST OF PERIOD SINCE LAST DECEMBER S STUDENT TROUBLES HERE ( REFTEL),  BUT HAS RE- SURFACED IN RECENT WEEKS.\n2.   CURRENT PUNJABI INTEREST IN PROBLEM STARTED WITH FRONT- CLAIMED BHUTTO GOVT WAS PREPARING TO RECOGNIZE BANGLADESH. PAPER SAID PRESIDENT HAD RECENTLY CONVENED MEETING OF PPP MNA S  LIMITED OFFICIAL USE\n3.   PRESS REPORTS BROUGHT FORTH BARRAGE OF STATEMENTS,  THREATS AND WARNINGS FROM ANTI- RECOGNITION CAMP HERE.   AS USUAL,  LEAD WAS TAKEN BY JAMAAT- I- ISLAMI ( JI)  WHEN ITS NATIONAL LEADER STRONGLY CRITICIZED IDEA.   IMMEDIATELY THEREAFTER,  JI STUDENT ORGANIZATION CHIEF DECLARED AT LAHORE PRESS CONFERENCE THAT STUDENTS WOULD UNANIMOUSLY OPPOSE GOVT ON THIS ISSUE ( INTERESTING TO NOTE THAT GOVERNOR KHAR ORDERED ALL PUNJAB COLLEGES AND UNI- VERSITIES TO CLOSE JUNE 16  RATHER THAN ON USUAL EARLY JULY DATE).   A NUMBER OF OTHER STUDENT LEADERS ( NON- PPP)  HAVE ISSUED SIMILAR STATEMENTS.   DURING FOLLOWING WEEK,  WHILE OPPOSTION PRESS EDITORIALIZED AGAINST RECOGNITION,  TEHRIK- I- ISTIQLAL LEADER,  RETIRED AIR MARSHALL ASGHAR KHAN,  DEVOTED TYPICALLY FLAILING ATTACK AGAINST BHUTTO AND GOVT TO ISSUE OF B.

COMMENT:  NON- PARTY PKISTANI OBSERVERS WHO HAVE TALKED TO US RECENTLY ABOUT RECOGNITION APPEAR TO AGREE THAT PUNJABI PUBLIC ATTITUDES ON THIS CONTENTIOUS ISSUE ARE HARDENING SOME- WHAT IN ABSENCE ANY SOLUTION TO POW PROBLEM.   EVEN PPP MEMBERS PRESENT IN SUCH DISCUSSIONS ADMIT THAT PUNJABI ATTITUDES ARE CONTINUING TO MAIE IT DIFFICULT FOR BHUTTO TO RESOLVE PROBLEM.

JUNE 8  NATIONAL ASSEMBLY APPOINTED 9- MEMBER DELEGATION OF NA MEMBERS,  HEADED BY GOP MINISTER OF LAW AND PARLIAMENTARY AFFAIRS PIRZADA,  TO INVESTI- GATE CONDITIONS IN BALUCHISTAN AND REPORT BACK TO THE ASSEMBLY WITHIN TWO WEEKS.  GROUP EXPECTED TO ARRIVE BALUCHISTAN EVENING OF JUNE 15  AND TOUR VARIOUS AREAS OF PROVINCE.  SAME DAY NAP/ UDF LEADER SARDAR ATTAULLAH KHAN MENGAL ANNOUNCED IN QUETTA THAT NO- CONFIDENCE MOTION WOULD BE MOVED BY 12  MEMBERS WHEN PROVINCIAL ASSEMBLY CONVENED FOR BUDGET SESSION.  THUS FAR,  NINE OF 12  MEMBERS HAVE SIGNED MOTION.  ABSENT FROM LIST OF SIGNATORS ARE TWO NAP MPA S FROM MEKRAN DISTRICT NOT THEN IN QUETTA AND MPA AHMED NAWAZ BUGTI REPORTED TO BE IN KARACHI.  REPORTS FROM PARTICIPANZS IN GOVERNMENT SPONSORED PRESS TOUR ( JUNE 6)  HAVE BEEN RELATIVELY LOW KEY AND,  WHILE ADMITTING FOOD SHORTAGES IN SOME AREAS, HAVE NOT HIGHLIGHTED PAST INCIDENTS OF VIOLENCE OR SUG- GESTED THAT THERE ANY MAJOR DISTURBANCES CURRENTLY OCCUR- RING THE MENGAL AND MARRI AREAS WHICH THEY VISIZED.\n2.  SINCE MENGAL S JUNE 11  CALL FOR CIVIL DISOBEDIENCE MOVEMENT REPORTS OF ARRESTS OF NAP- JUI SUPPORTERS HAVE INCREASED AND AT LEAST TWENTY- FIVE WERE TAKEN INTO CUS- TODY JUNE 12, 13  AND 14,  SOME FROM QUETTA,  BUT THE BULK OF THEM FROM OUTLYING AREAS.  ON JUNE 10 EX- NAP- JUI MINISTER OF EDUCATION GUL KHAN NASEER WAS ARRESTED IN QUETTA ON CORRUPTION CHARGES.  NASEER S ARREST DESCRIBED BY CHIEF MINISTER JAM SAHIB OF LAS BELA AS NOT BEING POLITICALLY MOTIVATED,  BUT PURELY A CRIMINAL MATTER.  FAILURE TO ARREST OTHER EX- NAP- JUI MINISTERS  LIMITED OFFICIAL USE\n3.  MENGAL S JUNE 11  CALL FOR "" CIVIL DISOBEDIENCE""  MOVE- MENT TO COMMENCE JUNE 15  DREW UNFAVORABLE COMMENT FROM SECRETARY OF THE UDF,  BECAUSE IT WAS ISSUED BY PROVINCIAL NAP WITHOUT REFERENCE TO CENTRAL NAP AND UDF.  FOLLOWING THIS,  COMPROMISER BIJENZO TRAVELED TO QUETTA AND ON JUNE\n4.  EVENING OF JUNE 14   SHORTLY AFTER HIS ARRIVAL IN QUETTA FROM FOUR- DAY TOUR IN SIND,  PRESIDENT BHUTTO MET SEPARATELY WITH FIVE NAP- JUI MPA S.  ACCORDING TO PRESS ACCOUNTS NAP- JUI MPA S HAD BEEN AUTHORIZED BY THE COALITION S PARLIAMENTARY GROUP TO MEET INDIVIDUALLY OR COLLECTIVELY  WITH PRESIDENT AS THEY WISHED.  NONE OF THE NAP STALWARTS -- MENGAL,  MARRI OR AHMED NAWAZ BUGTI OR THE TWO MPA MEMBERS FROM MEKRAN --  WERE AMONG THOSE WHO MET WITH PRESIDENT.  THERE NO REPORTS OF SUBJECT OF PRESIDENTIAL DISCUSSIONS WITH MPA S,  BUT WE SURMISE BHUTTO CARRYING FORWARD EFFORTS TO CAJOLE OR INTIMIDATE LESS HARD- LINE FIGURES OF NAP- JUI COALITION TO SHIFT THEIR ALLEGIANCE TO BUGTI GROUP.\n5.  COMMENT:   THUS FAR NAP- JUI COALITION APPEARS TO HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFUL IN MAINTAINING ITS UNIT.  BUGTI S INABILITY TO FORGE A COALITION IN THE PAST FOUR MONTHS HAS RESULTED IN AN UNTIDY PROVINCIAL POLITICAL SITUATION WHICH IS DRAWING INCREASING UNFAVORABLE PUBLIC COMMENT AND CONSTITUTES EMBARASSMENT TO BHUTTO REGIME.  WHETHER BHUTTO S PERSONAL INVOLVEMENT WILL SUCCEED AT ELEVENTH  LIMITED OFFICIAL USE   LIMITED OFFICIAL   HOUR IN ESTABLISHMENT OF COALITION ACCEPTABLE TO HIM REMAINS TO BE SEEN.  AT THIS POINT,  SACRIFICING BUGTI MIGHT DO THE TRICK,  BUT DOUBTFUL BHUTTO WOULD COUNTENANCE THIS.  BHUTTO DOES HAVE OPTIONS OF REIMPOSING PRESIDENTIAL RULE OR DISSOLVING ASSEMBLY AS LAST DITCH MEASURES,  BUT AS NEITHER ACTION WOULD RESOLVE BASIC IMPASSE IT LIKELY THAT ATTEMPTS TO ARRANGE SOME OTHER TYPE OF PACKAGE WILL CONTINUE.

SUMMARY:  BHUTTO IS CONCERNED OVER THE NEED TO FIND SOME SOLUTION FOR CURRENT UNSTABLE POLITICAL SITUATION IN BALUCHISTAN.  RECENT VIOLENCE THERE,  WHICH LED TO CENTRAL GOVERNMENT S INTRODUCTION OF SOME ARMY UNITS,  HAS COMPLICATED PROBLEM OF FINDING SATISFACTORY ACCOMMODATION. ANOTHER PROBLEM IS SNIPING BY NAP LEADERS AT SHAH S ALLEGED INTERFERENCE IN PAK DOMESTIC AFFAIRS,  WHICH BHUTTO DIS- CUSSED DURING RECENT VISIT TO IRAN.  BHUTTO ANTICIPATES THAT NEW CONSTITUTION WILL TAKE EFFECT ON AUGUST 14.  MEAN- WHILE,  HE APPEARS TO BE CHANGING HIS MIND ON EARLIER INTENTION TO CALL FOR NEW GENERAL ELECTIONS THIS SUMMER.  HE EXPRESSED CONTINUING CONCERN OVER HEAVY BURDEN OF PAK MILITARY EXPENDITURE.  END SUMMARY\n1.  MORNING AFTER OUR RETURN FROM LEAVE IN INDIA,  PRES BHUTTO SENT WORD INVITING MY WIFE AND ME TO HAVE DINNER WITH HIM AND BEGUM BHUTTO THAT SAME EVENING JUNE 3  AT PRESIDENT S HOUSE IN NATHIAGALI HILL STATION. ( BHUTTOS  CONFIDENTIAL\n2.  BHUTTO OPENED CONVERSATION BY NOTING HIS MAJOR CONCERN IS OVER SITUATION IN BALUCHISTAN.  PASSAGE OF CONSTITUTION HAD BEEN GREAT STEP.  SINCE THEN,  A QTE NATURAL MAJORITY UNQTE HAD EVOLVED IN SUPPORT OF PRESENT PROVINCIAL GOVERN- MENT IN NWFP,  WHERE PREVIOUS NAP/ JUI COALITION HAD LOST CONSIDERABLE STRENGTH IN PROVINCIAL ASSEMBLY,  WALI KHAN ( NAP CHIEF)  WAS CONTINUING HIS SHARP ATTACKS ON BHUTTO REGIME ( AS WELL AS ON ALLEGED IRANIAN INFLUENCE ON BHUTTO) BUT BHUTTO THOUGHT HIS BARK DID NOT HAVE MUCH BITE AS REGARDS NWFP.  BALUCHISTAN WAS DIFFERENT MATTER.  NEW PROVINCIAL GOVERNMENT THERE UNDER GOVERNOR BUGTI AND CHIEF MINISTER JAM SAHIB OF LASBELA,   WHICH REPLACED EARLIER NAP- LED GOVERNMENT,  HAD NOT BEEN ABLE ESTABLISH ITSELF AS FIRMLY AS BHUTTO HAD HOPED.  PROVINCIAL GOVERNMENT WITH SUPPORT OF PPP WAS STILL NEGOTIATING,  BHUTTO VOLUNTEERED,  TO WIN OVER SOME NAP MEMBERS OF PROVINCIAL ASSEMBLY WHO WERE HOLDING OUT FOR RATHER HIGH PRICE.  BHUTTO ESTIMATED THAT AT THIS MOMENT PRESENT GOVERNMENT WOULD BE SHORT OF MAJORITY BY TWO SEATS IF VOTE OF CONFIDENCE WERE TAKEN IN PRIVINCIAL ASSEMBLY.  LARGELY TO PLAY FOR MORE TIME BEFORE SHOWDOWN ON VOTE,  BUDGET SESSION OF BALUCHISTAN ASSEMBLY WOULD NOT MEET UNTIL JUNE 22,  SOME TWO- THREE WEEKS LATER THAN WOULD ORDINARILY BE EXPECTED.\n3.  BHUTTO COMPLAINED THAT POLITICAL SITUATION IN BALUCHIS- TAN,  WHICH WAS ALREADY DIFFICULT ENOUGH,  HAD BEEN COMPLI- CATED BY VIOLENCE RESORTED TO BY ELEMENTS OPPOSED TO PRESENT GOVERNMENT.  HE MENTIONED UNPROVOKED SHOOTING OF EIGHT MEMBERS OF DIR SCOUTS JUST OVER TWO WEEKS AGO AND ALSO AN INCREASE IN VIOLENCE BY MENGAL TRIBESMEN IN JHALAWAN AREA. CENTRAL GOVERNMENT HAD HAD NO CHOICE,  HE SAID,  BUT TO DEPLOY SOME ARMY UNITS IN ATTEMPT TO MAINTAIN ORDER. ARMY HAD BEEN WELL RECEIVED AND HAD NOT HAD TO FIRE A SINGLE SHOT.  IN RESPONSE MY QUERY AS TO WHETHER PAK  CONFIDENTIAL\n4.  BHUTTO THEN RECOUNTED HIS NEGOTIATION WITH FORMER BALUCH GOVERNOR BIZENJO AND FORMER BALUCH CHIEF MINISTER MEGAL ( BOTH OF NAP)  NOT LONG BEFORE BHUTTO HAD DEPARTED ON VISIT TO IRAN IN MID- MAY.  PURPOSE HAD BEEN TO WORK OOT AMICABLE ARRANGEMENT INTENDED TO STABILIZE SITUATION IN PROVINCE.  UNDERSTANDING THEY REACHED AT THAT TIME WAS THAT A NEW COALITION GOVERNMENT,  HEADED BY NAP CHIEF MINISTER AND INCLUDING MEMBERSHIP FROM PPP AS WELL AS JUI,  WOULD REPLACE PRESENT MINISTRY LED BY JAM SAHIB. IN ADDITION,  GOVERNOR BUGTI ( WHO IS ANATHEMA TO NAP)  WOULD BE REPLACED BY SOMEONE ACCEPTABLE TO NAP AS WELL AS TO BHUTTO.  UNFORTUNATELY,  SINCE THEN,  NAP HAD MADE THINGS DIFFICULT BY INDULGING IN VIOLENCE AND ALSO IN SWIPES AT ALLEGED IRANIAN INFLUENCE ON BHUTTO AND ALLEGED INCLINATION OF SHAH TO INTERFERE IN PAK DOMESTIC POLITICS.\n5.  ON LATTER POINT,  BHUTTO RECALLED HAVING TOLD CHARGE BEFORE DEPARTING FOR IRAN VISIT,  THAT HE HAD BEEN SOME- WHAT SET BACK BY COMMENTS ON PAKISTAN ATTRIBUTED TO SHAH IN LATEST INTERVIEW WITH CY SULZBERGER.  HE SAID SHAH WAS ACCUSTOMED TO OPERATING IN POLITICAL CLIMATE SUCH AS EXISTS IN IRAN AND DID NOT SEEM TO UNDERSTAND PROBLEMS FACING BHUTTO IN DEALING WITH DOMESTIC OPPOSI- TION.  SHAH HAD EXPRESSED TO BHUTTO HIS CONCERN OVER NAP POLICIES AND INTENTIONS AND SEEMED TO THINK THAT BHUTTO COULD SIMPLY DISPOSE OF NAP LEADERSHIP SO THAT IT WOULD NO LONGER PRESENT PROBLEM.  BHUTTO SAID HE HAD SPOKEN AT SOME LENGTH TO SHAH,  EXPLAINING HIS OWN LIMITATIONS UNDER PAK POLITICAL SYSTEM AND URGING SHAH TO INVITE BIZENJO AND MANGAL TO VISIT IRAN SO THAT HE COULD SIZE THEM UP AND GIVE THEM BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF SHAH S SINCERE INTEREST IN WELL- BEING OF PAKISTAN.  BEFORE BHUTTO LEFT IRAN,  HE HAD IMPRESSION THAT SHAH WAS AGREEABLE TO THIS PROPOSAL.\n",916824

MATTERS CAME TO HEAD IN FINAL WEEK OF MAY,  WHEN LEADERS OF VARIOUS FACTIONS WERE SUMMONED TO RAWALPINDI TO MEET WITH BHUTTO.   IN THE MEANTIME,  KASHMIR IMBROGLIO HAD BEEN RAISED IN THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY TO OBVIOUS EMBARRASSMENT OF GOP WHICH ASSUMED,  PROBABLY CORRECTLY, THAT DIRTY LINEN BEING AIRED WOULD BE GLEEFULLY EXPLOITED BY INDIA.\n9.  ALTHOUGH DETAILS OF ANY AGREEMENT REACHED AS RESULT BHUTTO S INTERVENTION HAVE NOT BEEN ANNOUNCED, KASHMIR PRESIDENT QAYYUM TOLD PRESS MAY 31  HE WAS PREPARED TO QUIT HIS OFFICE SHOULD A NO- CONFIDENCE RESOLUTION BE PASSED.  HE DESCRIBED HIS MEETING WITH BHUTTO AS "" VERY CORDIAL"",  BUT SAID CATEGORICALLY THAT PEOPLES  PARTY SHOULD BE BANNED IN KASHMIR ALONG WITH JAMAAT- I- ISLAMI.  HE WAS ALSO HIGHLY CRITICAL OF ROLE OF CENTRAL KASHMIR AFFAIRS MINISTER QAIYUM IN ATTEMPTIING TO UNDERMINE KASHMIR GOVERNMENT.  HE ADDED THAT BHUTTO HAD ASSURED HIM DEMOCRATIC GOVERNMENT IN AZAD KASHMIR WOULD BE PERMITTED TO FUNCTION.\n1.  COMMENT:  OBSERVERS IN ISLAMABAD FIND IT DIFFICULT TO FATHOM GOP/ PEOPLES  PARTY EFFORTS TO DISLODGE QAYYUM GOVERNMENT AT THIS TIME,  GIVEN EXISTING POLITICAL PROBLEM IN BALUCHISTAN,  PEOPLES  PARTY INTERNAL DISPUTES, AND SENSITIVITY OF ALL MATTERS RELATING TO KASHMIR. BHUTTO MAY BE UNHAPPY AT MANNER IN WHICH SARDAR QAYYUM HAS USED WIDE POWERS GRANTED HIS GOVERNMENT BY 1970 KASHMIR CONSTITUTION TO RESIST DIRECTION FROM ISLAMABAD, AND DECIDED TO REMOVE HIM OR AT LEAST CUT HIM DOWN TO SIZE.  ALTERNATELY,  MOVES AGAINST QAYYUM GOVERNMENT MAY HAVE BEEN SPARKED BY BHUTTO S OVER- EAGER AIDES, WITH BHUTTO FORCED TO INTERVENE PERSONALLY WHEN THEIR ACTIVITIES BECAME PUBLIC.  JOURNALISTS ARE SAYING,  HOWEVER,  THAT INTERIOR AND KASHMIR AFFAIRS MINISTER QAIYUM KHAN IS GROUSING THAT BHUTTO INSTRUCTED HIM TO GET RID OF KASHMIR GOVERNMENT,  BUT BACKTRACKED WHEN AFFAIR BECAME HIGHLY PUBLIC,  LEAVING MINISTER TO TAKE THE BLAME.  ALTHOUGH IT IS UNCERTAIN WHETHER QAYYUM GOVERNMENT WILL REMAIN IN OFFICE,  AIRING OF VARIOUS GOP MANEUVERS AGAINST HIS POPULARLY ELECTED GOVERNMENT HAS EMBARRASSED BHUTTO DOMESTICALLY AND COULD PROVIDE USEFUL PROPAGANDA TOOL TO INDIA AS WELL AS TO HIS DOMESTIC OPPONENTS.

MONTH OF JUNE HAS WITNESSED SOME MODEST ENHANCEMENT IN PUNJAB POLITICAL STRENGTH OF RETIRED AIR MRSHAL ASGHAR KHAN,  CHIEF OF TEHREEK- I- ISTIQLAL- I- PAKISTAN ( TEHREEK)  PARTY,  WHO HAS ANNOUNCED SHIFT OF HIS PERMANENT ADDRESS TO LAHORE.\n2.

ON JUNE 10  HE WAS FOLLOWED BY ANOTHER ( FORMER PPP)  MNA,  AHMAD RAZA KASURI.   WITHIN THE WEEK  LIMITED OFFICIAL USE\n3.   PARTY WAS BUSY DURING MONTH WITH FREQUENT PRESS CON- FERENCES AND GATHERINGS IN LAHORE IN WHICH FORMER AIR MARSHALL EXUDED OPTIMISM ABOUT TEHREEK S FUTURE AND CONTINUED HIS ROUNDHOUSE DENOUNCEMENTS OF BHUTTO AND PPP. HE OPPOSED BANGLADESH RECOGNITION ( REFTEL)  ON GROUNDS IT WOULD CLOSE DOOR TO REUNIFICATION;  DEMANDED BHUTTO BE BROUGHT TO ACCOUNT FOR HIS ROLE IN LOSS OF EAST WING; CHARGED RULING PARTY WITH PUSHING BALUCHISTAN AND NWFP TOWARD PROVINCIALISM;  ATTACKED GOVT S REPRESSION OF POLITICAL OPPONENTS;  AND PROMISED AGITATION ON PROBLEM OF HIGH PRICES.   HE RAISED EYEBROWS AT ONE POINT,  INCLUDING SOME OF HIS OWN PARTY,  BY DESCRIBING SHEIKH MUJIB ASHAVING BEEN PATRIOT WHO BELIEVED IN INTEGRITY OF PAKISTAN AND WANTED NOTHING MORE THAN TO BE PRIME MINISTER OF ENTIRE COUNTRY.\n4.   ASGHAR KHAN ALSO PERFORMED DURING MONTH WHAT HE DOES BEST:  DEFIANT PUBLIC APPEARANCE WHICH AMOUNTED TO THUMBING NOSE AT PPP.   AFTER REPEATED PUBLIC ANNOUNCEMENTS,  HE APPEARED ON JUNE 18  FOR AFTERNOON PRAYERS AT MARTYR S MOSQUE ON CENTRAL POINT OF LAHORE S MAIN STREET,  THE MALL, TOGETHER WITH BAND OF FOLLOWERS.   MOSQUE IS SITUATED HUNDRED YARDS FROM PPP CITY HQ ON ONE SIDE AND EQUI- DISTANT FROM PPP DISTRICT HQ ON OTHER SIDE.   POLICE SATURATED AREA AND TENSE SITUATION,  WHICH INCLUDED PRESENCE OF HUNDREDS OF PPP TOUGHS,  PASSED WITHOUT INCIDENT.\n5.   COMMENT:  MANY OF OUR PAKISTANI CONTACTS HAVE MIXED FEELINGS ABOUT ASGHAR,  DISMISSING HIM POLITICALLY AS A NON- STARTER,  BUT COMPELLED TO ADMIRE HIS GUTS.

SUMMARY:  BHUTTO IS CONCERNED OVER THE NEED TO FIND SOME SOLUTION FOR CURRENT UNSTABLE POLITICAL SITUATION IN BALUCHISTAN.  RECENT VIOLENCE THERE,  WHICH LED TO CENTRAL GOVERNMENT S INTRODUCTION OF SOME ARMY UNITS,  HAS COMPLICATED PROBLEM OF FINDING SATISFACTORY ACCOMMODATION. ANOTHER PROBLEM IS SNIPING BY NAP LEADERS AT SHAH S ALLEGED INTERFERENCE IN PAK DOMESTIC AFFAIRS,  WHICH BHUTTO DIS- CUSSED DURING RECENT VISIT TO IRAN.  BHUTTO ANTICIPATES THAT NEW CONSTITUTION WILL TAKE EFFECT ON AUGUST 14.  MEAN- WHILE,  HE APPEARS TO BE CHANGING HIS MIND ON EARLIER INTENTION TO CALL FOR NEW GENERAL ELECTIONS THIS SUMMER.  HE EXPRESSED CONTINUING CONCERN OVER HEAVY BURDEN OF PAK MILITARY EXPENDITURE.  END SUMMARY\n1.  MORNING AFTER OUR RETURN FROM LEAVE IN INDIA,  PRES BHUTTO SENT WORD INVITING MY WIFE AND ME TO HAVE DINNER WITH HIM AND BEGUM BHUTTO THAT SAME EVENING JUNE 3  AT PRESIDENT S HOUSE IN NATHIAGALI HILL STATION. ( BHUTTOS  CONFIDENTIAL\n2.  BHUTTO OPENED CONVERSATION BY NOTING HIS MAJOR CONCERN IS OVER SITUATION IN BALUCHISTAN.  PASSAGE OF CONSTITUTION HAD BEEN GREAT STEP.  SINCE THEN,  A QTE NATURAL MAJORITY UNQTE HAD EVOLVED IN SUPPORT OF PRESENT PROVINCIAL GOVERN- MENT IN NWFP,  WHERE PREVIOUS NAP/ JUI COALITION HAD LOST CONSIDERABLE STRENGTH IN PROVINCIAL ASSEMBLY,  WALI KHAN ( NAP CHIEF)  WAS CONTINUING HIS SHARP ATTACKS ON BHUTTO REGIME ( AS WELL AS ON ALLEGED IRANIAN INFLUENCE ON BHUTTO) BUT BHUTTO THOUGHT HIS BARK DID NOT HAVE MUCH BITE AS REGARDS NWFP.  BALUCHISTAN WAS DIFFERENT MATTER.  NEW PROVINCIAL GOVERNMENT THERE UNDER GOVERNOR BUGTI AND CHIEF MINISTER JAM SAHIB OF LASBELA,   WHICH REPLACED EARLIER NAP- LED GOVERNMENT,  HAD NOT BEEN ABLE ESTABLISH ITSELF AS FIRMLY AS BHUTTO HAD HOPED.  PROVINCIAL GOVERNMENT WITH SUPPORT OF PPP WAS STILL NEGOTIATING,  BHUTTO VOLUNTEERED,  TO WIN OVER SOME NAP MEMBERS OF PROVINCIAL ASSEMBLY WHO WERE HOLDING OUT FOR RATHER HIGH PRICE.  BHUTTO ESTIMATED THAT AT THIS MOMENT PRESENT GOVERNMENT WOULD BE SHORT OF MAJORITY BY TWO SEATS IF VOTE OF CONFIDENCE WERE TAKEN IN PRIVINCIAL ASSEMBLY.  LARGELY TO PLAY FOR MORE TIME BEFORE SHOWDOWN ON VOTE,  BUDGET SESSION OF BALUCHISTAN ASSEMBLY WOULD NOT MEET UNTIL JUNE 22,  SOME TWO- THREE WEEKS LATER THAN WOULD ORDINARILY BE EXPECTED.\n3.  BHUTTO COMPLAINED THAT POLITICAL SITUATION IN BALUCHIS- TAN,  WHICH WAS ALREADY DIFFICULT ENOUGH,  HAD BEEN COMPLI- CATED BY VIOLENCE RESORTED TO BY ELEMENTS OPPOSED TO PRESENT GOVERNMENT.  HE MENTIONED UNPROVOKED SHOOTING OF EIGHT MEMBERS OF DIR SCOUTS JUST OVER TWO WEEKS AGO AND ALSO AN INCREASE IN VIOLENCE BY MENGAL TRIBESMEN IN JHALAWAN AREA. CENTRAL GOVERNMENT HAD HAD NO CHOICE,  HE SAID,  BUT TO DEPLOY SOME ARMY UNITS IN ATTEMPT TO MAINTAIN ORDER. ARMY HAD BEEN WELL RECEIVED AND HAD NOT HAD TO FIRE A SINGLE SHOT.  IN RESPONSE MY QUERY AS TO WHETHER PAK  CONFIDENTIAL\n4.  BHUTTO THEN RECOUNTED HIS NEGOTIATION WITH FORMER BALUCH GOVERNOR BIZENJO AND FORMER BALUCH CHIEF MINISTER MEGAL ( BOTH OF NAP)  NOT LONG BEFORE BHUTTO HAD DEPARTED ON VISIT TO IRAN IN MID- MAY.  PURPOSE HAD BEEN TO WORK OOT AMICABLE ARRANGEMENT INTENDED TO STABILIZE SITUATION IN PROVINCE.  UNDERSTANDING THEY REACHED AT THAT TIME WAS THAT A NEW COALITION GOVERNMENT,  HEADED BY NAP CHIEF MINISTER AND INCLUDING MEMBERSHIP FROM PPP AS WELL AS JUI,  WOULD REPLACE PRESENT MINISTRY LED BY JAM SAHIB. IN ADDITION,  GOVERNOR BUGTI ( WHO IS ANATHEMA TO NAP)  WOULD BE REPLACED BY SOMEONE ACCEPTABLE TO NAP AS WELL AS TO BHUTTO.  UNFORTUNATELY,  SINCE THEN,  NAP HAD MADE THINGS DIFFICULT BY INDULGING IN VIOLENCE AND ALSO IN SWIPES AT ALLEGED IRANIAN INFLUENCE ON BHUTTO AND ALLEGED INCLINATION OF SHAH TO INTERFERE IN PAK DOMESTIC POLITICS.\n5.  ON LATTER POINT,  BHUTTO RECALLED HAVING TOLD CHARGE BEFORE DEPARTING FOR IRAN VISIT,  THAT HE HAD BEEN SOME- WHAT SET BACK BY COMMENTS ON PAKISTAN ATTRIBUTED TO SHAH IN LATEST INTERVIEW WITH CY SULZBERGER.  HE SAID SHAH WAS ACCUSTOMED TO OPERATING IN POLITICAL CLIMATE SUCH AS EXISTS IN IRAN AND DID NOT SEEM TO UNDERSTAND PROBLEMS FACING BHUTTO IN DEALING WITH DOMESTIC OPPOSI- TION.  SHAH HAD EXPRESSED TO BHUTTO HIS CONCERN OVER NAP POLICIES AND INTENTIONS AND SEEMED TO THINK THAT BHUTTO COULD SIMPLY DISPOSE OF NAP LEADERSHIP SO THAT IT WOULD NO LONGER PRESENT PROBLEM.  BHUTTO SAID HE HAD SPOKEN AT SOME LENGTH TO SHAH,  EXPLAINING HIS OWN LIMITATIONS UNDER PAK POLITICAL SYSTEM AND URGING SHAH TO INVITE BIZENJO AND MANGAL TO VISIT IRAN SO THAT HE COULD SIZE THEM UP AND GIVE THEM BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF SHAH S SINCERE INTEREST IN WELL- BEING OF PAKISTAN.  BEFORE BHUTTO LEFT IRAN,  HE HAD IMPRESSION THAT SHAH WAS AGREEABLE TO THIS PROPOSAL.\n",916824

PARLIAMENTARY AFFAIRS MINISTER PIRZADA, POLITICAL AFFAIRS MINISTER JATOI,  AND SPECIAL ASSISTANT RAFI RAZA PARTICIPATED ON GOVERNMENT SIDE WITH BHUTTO. SERIES OF MEETINOS SIGNAL BHUTTO S CONCESSION OF DEFEAT IN EFFORTS TO BREAK NAP/ JUI POSITION IN BALUCHISTAN.\n2.  ALTHOUGH BOTH SIDES HAVE BEEN CLOSE- MOUTHED ABOUT TALKS, OBJECT IS CLEARLY TO FIND SOME COMPROMISEIWAY OUT OF EXTRA- LEGAL PARLIAMENTARY SITUATION PREVAILING IN BALUCHISTAN WHERE NAP- JUI COALITION HAS MAJORITY ( NOW REDUCED TO ONE) IN PROVINCIAL ASSEMBLY ALTHOUGH THREE- MAN PROVINCIAL MINISTRY IN HANDS OF PRO- BHUTTO GROUP.  ON JUNE 28,  BHUTTO MOVED TO SIDESTEP CONSTITUTIONAL NEED TO SUMMON ASSEMBLY TO PROVIDE AUTHORITY FOR GOVERNMENT SPENDING IN NEW FISCAL YEAR BY PROMULGATING CONSTITUTIONAL  AMENDMENT ORDINANCE GIVING GOVERNORS POWER TO "" AUTHENTICATE""  EXPENDITURE FOR NEXT FISCAL YEAR WHEN PROVINCIAL ASSEMBLIES NOT IN SESSION.  WHETHER BHUTTO TOOK THIS ACTION WITH ACQUIESENCE OF NAP LEADERS IS NOT KNOWN.  PRESISENT IS STILL UNDER PRESSURE TO PERMIT ASSEMBLY TO MEET,  HOWEVER,  SINCE INTERIM CONSTITUTION REQUIRES ASSEMBLY SESSION EVERY SIX MONTHS.  BALUCH ASSEMBLY ADJOURNED LAST ON JANUARY 12.  THEREFORE ASSEMBLY,  UNLESS DISSOLVED,  MUST MEET BEFORE JULY 13.\n3.  COMPROMISE EVIDENTLY BEING DISCUSSED PROBABLY INCLUDES FOLLOWING ELEMENTS:  NAP/ JUI GOVERNMENT WOULD BE RESTORED IN BALUCHISTAN BUT WITH ONE OR TWO PROVINCIAL MINISTERS  LIMITED OFFICIAL USE\n4.  ALTHOUGH PPP IN FRONTIER APPARENTLY CHAFING AT GOVERNOR KHATTAK  S ONE- MAN CONTROL OF PROVINCIAL MACHINERY OF GOVERNMENT,  EMBASSY NOT INCLINED TO BELIEVE BHUTTO WILL NOW ATTEMPT,  AS PART OF TALKS WITH NAP,  ANY MANEUVERS DESIGNED BRING DOWN KHATTAK UNITED FRONT CONTROLLED GOVERNMENT AND SUBSTITUTE NEW COALITION BUILT AROUND NAP/ JUI/ PPP.  SUCH MANEUVER WOULD ALSO NECESSITATE EXIT OF QAIYUM FROM GOVERN- MENT.\n5.  RESULTS OF LATEST ROUND OF NAP/ PPP TALKS WILL PRESUMABLY BE KNOWN IN FEW DAYS.  ALTHOUGH PAST RECORD LEAVES LITTLE ROOM FOR OPTIMISM THAT ANY COMPROMIST BETWEEN THE TWO PARTIES WILL ENDURE FOR LONG,  THERE ARE IMPORTANT POLITICAL COM- PULSIONS ON BHUTTO MAKING FOR AN EFFORT TO CLEAR THE POIITICAL DECKS AT THIS TIME.  TRANSPARENT POLITICAL MANI- PULATION IN BALUCHISTAN BY GOP,  NOT UNLIKE THAT OF PRE- MARTIAL LAW GOVERNMENTS,  HAS EVIDENTLY DAMAGED BHUTTO S CREDIBILITY AMONG MIDDLE CLASS.  MOREOVER,  MANY IN BHUTTO S OWN PARTY FROM SIND AND PUNJAB REPORTEDLY UNHAPPY AT LACK OF DEMONSTRABLE ACHIEVEMENTS BY PPP GOVERNMENT TO DATE.

DURING MY LONG MEETING WITH BHUTTO AT NATHIAGALI ON JUNE 3,   I INQUIRED ON PARTICULAR INTERESTS HE FORE-  SAW IN STATE VISIT TO WASHINGTON ON JULY 17-18.  HE PONDERED A BIT AND THEN SAID HE WOULD BE FUNDAMENTALLY INTERESTED,  IN COLLECTIVE DISCUSSION OR INDIVIDUAL CONVERSATION WITH PRES NIXON,  IN GETTING USG VIEW ON LIKELY FUTURE COURSE OF OUR RELATIONS WITH USSR AND PRC,  AND ON DEVELOPMENTS IN THOSE TWO COUNTRIES WITH PARTICULAR RELEVANCE TO EFFECT ON SUBCONTINENT.  GOP MAY HAVE VIEWS OF ITS OWN AND CONCERN,  FOR EXAMPLE,  REGARDING SOVIET INTENTIONS IN SUBCONTINENT,  PERSIAN GULF AND INDIAN OCEAN.  BUT HE WOULD LIKE TO KNOW HOW THESE VIEWS COINCIDE WITH OR DIVERGE FROM OURS.  HE THOUGHT FORTHCOMING BREZHNEV VISIT TO WASHINGTON WOULD PROVIDE USG WITH FRESH BASIS FOR PROBING AND ASSESSING SOVIET AIMS WORLDWIDE,  AND HE HOPED THIS WOULD ALSO PROVIDE INSIGHT RE SUBCONTINENT.  BHUTTO REFERRED AT THAT POINT TO HEAVY US ARMS SALES TO IRAN,  WHICH HE ASSUMED REFLECTED AT LEAST SOME SHARING OF ASSESSMENT WITH GOI ON FUTURE THREAT.  BHUTTO THEN SURPRISED ME BY SAYING THAT HE WOULD ALSO WISH TO HEAR OUR VIEWS ON LIKELIHOOD THAT USSR AND PRC MIGHT SEE IT IN THEIR  CONFIDENTIAL      INTEREST IN NOT- TOO- DISTANT FUTURE TO SUBLIMATE THEIR DIFFERENCES AND DECIDE TO "" GET TOGETHER.""  I TAKE THAT  AS REFLECTING CONCERN,  IN PART,  THAT CHINA AND INDIA MIGHT COME CLOSER AND THAT THIS COULD BASICALLY AFFECT PAKISTAN S RELATIONS WITH THE MAJOR POWERS IN ASIA. \n2.  ON BILATERAL MATTERS,  BHUTTO SAID HE MIGHT SOLICIT USG HELP TO PAKISTAN FOR EITHER THE "" CONQUESTOF DESERTS""  OR FOR MAJOR PROGRAM TO COMBAT WATERLOGGING/ SALINITY.  ON FIRST POINT HE NOTED THAT ALL FOUR PROVINCES OF PAKISTAN HAVE SUBSTANTIAL DESERT AREAS.  SEVERAL TIMES HE MENTIONED PROGRESS WHICH ISRAEL HAD BEEN ABLE TO MAKE IN MAKING THE DESERTS BLOOM.  PROGRESS ALONG THIS LINE IN PAKISTAN COULD REVOLUTIONIZE NATIONAL ECONOMY.  WITH REGARD TO WATERLOGGING/ SALINITY,  I ASKED IF HE WAS THINKING OF ANOTHER MISSION SUCH AS UNDERTAKEN IN EARLY 1960 S BY ROGER REVELLE AND WHETHER HE ALSO HAD IN MIND THE SCARP ( SALINITY CONTROL AND RECLAMATION PROJECT)  WHICH WEHAD INSTITUTED NUMBER OF YEARS AGO.  BHUTTO RESPONDED THAT HE HAD SOMETHING IN MIND CONSIDER-  ABLY LARGER THAN PAST SCARPS.  HE THEN SAID HE WOULD ALSO PLAN RAISE POSSIBILITY OF OUR COLLABORATION IN CONSTRUCTING A NEW PORT ON ARABIAN SEA COAST OF BALUCHISTAN  PROVINCE.

MATTERS CAME TO HEAD IN FINAL WEEK OF MAY,  WHEN LEADERS OF VARIOUS FACTIONS WERE SUMMONED TO RAWALPINDI TO MEET WITH BHUTTO.   IN THE MEANTIME,  KASHMIR IMBROGLIO HAD BEEN RAISED IN THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY TO OBVIOUS EMBARRASSMENT OF GOP WHICH ASSUMED,  PROBABLY CORRECTLY, THAT DIRTY LINEN BEING AIRED WOULD BE GLEEFULLY EXPLOITED BY INDIA.\n9.  ALTHOUGH DETAILS OF ANY AGREEMENT REACHED AS RESULT BHUTTO S INTERVENTION HAVE NOT BEEN ANNOUNCED, KASHMIR PRESIDENT QAYYUM TOLD PRESS MAY 31  HE WAS PREPARED TO QUIT HIS OFFICE SHOULD A NO- CONFIDENCE RESOLUTION BE PASSED.  HE DESCRIBED HIS MEETING WITH BHUTTO AS "" VERY CORDIAL"",  BUT SAID CATEGORICALLY THAT PEOPLES  PARTY SHOULD BE BANNED IN KASHMIR ALONG WITH JAMAAT- I- ISLAMI.  HE WAS ALSO HIGHLY CRITICAL OF ROLE OF CENTRAL KASHMIR AFFAIRS MINISTER QAIYUM IN ATTEMPTIING TO UNDERMINE KASHMIR GOVERNMENT.  HE ADDED THAT BHUTTO HAD ASSURED HIM DEMOCRATIC GOVERNMENT IN AZAD KASHMIR WOULD BE PERMITTED TO FUNCTION.\n1.  COMMENT:  OBSERVERS IN ISLAMABAD FIND IT DIFFICULT TO FATHOM GOP/ PEOPLES  PARTY EFFORTS TO DISLODGE QAYYUM GOVERNMENT AT THIS TIME,  GIVEN EXISTING POLITICAL PROBLEM IN BALUCHISTAN,  PEOPLES  PARTY INTERNAL DISPUTES, AND SENSITIVITY OF ALL MATTERS RELATING TO KASHMIR. BHUTTO MAY BE UNHAPPY AT MANNER IN WHICH SARDAR QAYYUM HAS USED WIDE POWERS GRANTED HIS GOVERNMENT BY 1970 KASHMIR CONSTITUTION TO RESIST DIRECTION FROM ISLAMABAD, AND DECIDED TO REMOVE HIM OR AT LEAST CUT HIM DOWN TO SIZE.  ALTERNATELY,  MOVES AGAINST QAYYUM GOVERNMENT MAY HAVE BEEN SPARKED BY BHUTTO S OVER- EAGER AIDES, WITH BHUTTO FORCED TO INTERVENE PERSONALLY WHEN THEIR ACTIVITIES BECAME PUBLIC.  JOURNALISTS ARE SAYING,  HOWEVER,  THAT INTERIOR AND KASHMIR AFFAIRS MINISTER QAIYUM KHAN IS GROUSING THAT BHUTTO INSTRUCTED HIM TO GET RID OF KASHMIR GOVERNMENT,  BUT BACKTRACKED WHEN AFFAIR BECAME HIGHLY PUBLIC,  LEAVING MINISTER TO TAKE THE BLAME.  ALTHOUGH IT IS UNCERTAIN WHETHER QAYYUM GOVERNMENT WILL REMAIN IN OFFICE,  AIRING OF VARIOUS GOP MANEUVERS AGAINST HIS POPULARLY ELECTED GOVERNMENT HAS EMBARRASSED BHUTTO DOMESTICALLY AND COULD PROVIDE USEFUL PROPAGANDA TOOL TO INDIA AS WELL AS TO HIS DOMESTIC OPPONENTS.

I ASKED WAS THIS NOT A CONSIDERABLE CHANGE FROM THE PROSPECT PREVIOUSLY HELD FORTH OF NO NET AID AT THE END OF THE PERIOD.  HE AGREED. I ASKED DID THE PLAN ENVISION RESOURCE FLOW THROUGH PRIVATE CAPITAL INVESTMENT.  IN THAT EVENT IT MIGHT HELP IF WE KNEW THE MAGNITUDES AS AMERICAN BUSINESS MIGHT BE INTERESTED.  NOT REALLY,  SAID HE.  INDIA DOES NOT NEED RESOURCES, HE SAID. ( A MEMCON ON THIS MEETING FOLLOWS.)\n3.  THIS IS INSUFFERABLE.  IF THEY WANT AID THEY SHOULD ASK FOR  CONFIDENTIAL\n4.

I THINK YOU SHOULD GET KAUL BACK IN AND STRAIGHTEN OUT A FEW THINGS WITH HIM.  HOW COME THAT HE IS DISAPPOINTED ABOUT OUR POSITIVE STATEMENT ON NEW AID AT THE CONSORTIUM WHEN THE INDIANS HAVEN T EVEN ASKED US FOR NEW AID YET.

KAUL READILY CONCURRED.   SPECIFIC POINTS COVERED IN CONVERSATION FOLLOW.\n2.   ARMSTRONG REVIEWED US THINKING ON INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS,  HOUSE FOREIGN AFFAIRS COMMITTEE PROPOSALS ON FOREIGN AID,  AND STATUS OF DISCUSSIONS IN C-20  ON INTERNATIONAL MONETARY ISSUES.   KAUL SAID INDIA WAS DISAPPOINTED AT WHAT HE CALLED LACK OF CONSULTATION WITH TEN ADDED MEMBERS OF C-20,  NOTING PARTICULARLY INDIAN POSITION ON SDR- AID LINK AND LDC PROBLEMS WITH FLOATING EXCHANGE RATES.

REGARDING THE TRADE BILL, ARMSTRONG SAID THE PROSPECTS APPEARED FAIRLY GOOD THAT A BILL WOULD PASS THE HOUSE THIS SUMMER AND THAT IT COULD BE PASSED BY THE SENATE BY DECEMBER.   AS FOR PROPOSED LIMITS ON GSP --  I. E.  DOLS 25  MILLION CEILING ON IMPORTS OF ANY ITEM FROM ONE COUNTRY UNDER GSP AND LIMIT OF 50  PERCENT OF TOTAL US IMPORTS OF THAT ITEM FROM ONE COUNTRY --  ARMSTRONG EXPLAINED THAT THESE HAD BEEN SUGGESTED IN PART TO AVOID MORE STRINGENT PROVISIONS BEING ADDED TO THE BILL.   KAUL SAID INDIA WOULD LIKE TO SEE CEILING SET AT DOLS 50  MILLION FROM ANY ONE COUNTRY.   DISCUSSION ENDED WITH KAUL ASKING THAT INDIAN VIEWS BE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT IN DEVELOPMENT US TRADE POLICY.

SUMMARY QAMARUL ISLAM INFORMED CHARGE THAT US NOTE WAS CONSIDERED OBJECTIONABLE ATTEMPT TO DICTATE GOP DECISION ON ELIMINATING OPIUM PRODUCTION.  HE SAID THAT IMMEDIATE ELIMINATION OF SETTLED PRODUCTION WAS IMPOSSIBLE.  GOP HAD INITIATED COMPREHENSIVE PLANNING PROCESS DESIGNED TO SOLVE RATHER THAN APPLY COSMETICS TO PROBLEM.  CHARGE REGRETTED ISLAM S INTERPRETATION OF NOTE,  EMPHASIZING LACK OF INTENT TO DICTATE ANYTHING ANT THAT IT WAS NOT "" TAKE- IT- OR- LEAVE- IT""  PROPOSAL.  HE REVIEWED EARLIER USG EFFORTS TO ENCOURAGE GOP PRODUC- TION PLANNING,  AND URGED FURTHER CONSIDERATION OF USG PROPOSAL AND POSSIBLE ALTERNATIVES.  WHILE INDICATING THAT GOP WOULD PROBABLY NOT COMPLETE PLANNING FOR AT LEAST TWO MONTHS,  ISLAM DID NOT RULE OUT POSSIBILITY OF SOME STATEMENT IN CONNECTION WITH BHUTTO VI IT. GOP DECISION FOR IMMEDIATE ELIMINATION OF SETTLED AREA PRODUCTION IS UNLIKELY,  BUT WE ARE HOPEFUL THAT RECENT EXCHANGES WITH ISLAM WILL ENCOURAGE GOP TO REEXAMINE ITS EARLIER THREE- YEAR TIMETABLE.  END SUMMARY.\n2.  QAMARUL ISLAM ( DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,  PLANNING COMMISSION) CALLED IN CHARGE JUNE 28  FOR DISCUSSION OF EMBASSY NOTE ON TIMETABLE FOR ELIMINATION OF OPIUM PRODUCTION.  MISSION NARCOTICS COORDINATOR ( SMITH)  ACCOMPANIED,  WHILE MFA DIR.  GEN.  ZAKI AND ORAKZAI SAT IN FOR GOP.  REFERRING TO HIS MEETING WITH AMB.  HANDLEY,  ISLAM SAID THAT "" HE HAD THROWN UP HIS HANDS IN HORROR""  WHEN HE WAS SHOWN COPY OF NOTE.  HE SAID THAT "" WE""  FOUND NOTE "" VERY OBJECTIONABLE"" BOTH IN TONE AND SUBSTANCE.  HE STATED THAT DICTATION OF TIMETABLE FOR GOP TO ELIMINATE OPIUM PRODUCTION BY USG OR ANY OTHER GOVERNMENT WAS OUT OF QUESTION.  REFERRING TO CHARGE S CONVERSATION WITH ZAK WHEN NOTE HAD BEEN PRESENTED ( REF C),  ISLAM ALSO TOOK EXCEPTION TO ALLEGED SUGGESTION THAT PROPOSAL CONTAINED IN NOTE BE DEALT WITH BY CABINET MINISTER.\n3.  AS TO SUBSTANCE,  ISLAM SAID PROPOSAL "" HAD NO MEANING""  BECAUSE IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE TO FULFILL. DECISION TO IMPLEMENT IT WOULD BE PURELY COSMETIC. GOP WISHED "" TO SOLVE PROBLEM,  NOT TINKER WITH IT."" PLANNING FOR ELIMINATION OF PRODUCTION NECESSITATED CONSIDERATION OF A BROAD RANGE OF ISSUES INCLUDING COMPENSATION,  ALTERNATIVE CROPS,  PROVISION OF FERTILIZER AND SEEDS,  AND CONSTRUCTION OF DAMS AND ROADS.  SUCH PLANNING REQUIRED THAT VIEWS OF THE PEOPLE AFFECTED RECEIVE CAREFUL ATTENTION.  HE SAID HE HAD INDICATED AT FINAL MEETING WITH US NARCOTICS TEAM ON FEB.  1  THAT IT WOULD TAKE TIME  TO PREPARE PEOPLE OF COUNTRY FOR THIS IMPORTANT STEP .  HE REMARKED THAT THIS MESSAGE APPEARED TO HAVE BEEN LOST UPON TEAM DESPITE EXCEPTIONAL CALIBER OF ITS WORK.  HE STATED GOP WAS IN PROCESS OF FORMULATING COMPREHENSIVE PLANS TO DEAL WITH PRODUCTION PHASEOUT WHICH WOULD BE PROCESSED AT EXPEDITIOUSLY AS POSSIBLE.  PLANS FOR MERGED AND TRIBAL AREAS WOULD FOLLOW FROM PLANS FOR SETTLED AREAS AND WOULD HAVE TO BE DRAWN UP WITH GREAT CAUTION.  QUESTION OF COMPENSATION FOR LOSS OF INCOME AND REVENUE FROM OPIUM PRODUCTION HAD NOT YET BEEN FULLY ADDRESSED,  BUT LARGE AMOUNTS OF MONEY WOULD BE REQUIRED TO COMPENSATE INDIVIDUAL FARMERS AND PROVINCIAL GOVERNMENTS,  AND TO FUND NEW FACILITIES AND INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS IN NWFP.  GOP WELCOMED VISIT OF  CONFIDENTIAL\n4.  DIGRESSING FROM CONTENTS OF NOTE,  ISLAM REMARKED THAT SUPPRESSION OF NARCOTICS TRAFFICKING WOULD REQUIRE LARGE NUMBERS OF ENFORCEMENT UNITS,  PERHAPS EVENTUALLY TOTAL OF SEVERAL HUNDRED.  US TEAM HAD PROPOSED FOUR, WHICH WAS COMPLETELY INADEQUATE.  NCB WAS NOT PROPOSING TO BEGIN WITH 25  FIELD INVESTIGATIVE UNITS ( FIU S). ISLAM NOTED THAT EARLIER NCB LIST OF EQUIPMENT REQUIRE-. MENTS PASSED TO EMBASSY HAD INCLUDED 75  REVOLVERS,  150 RIFLES AND 50  STEN GUNS.  ISLAM CLAIMED HE HAD BEEN IN- FORMED THAT AN EMBASSY OFFICER HAD TOLD NCB THAT PROVISION OF SUCH WEAPONS WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE BECAUSE IT WOULD BE "" THREAT TO SECURITY OF INDIA"",  WHICH HE BELIEVED WAS ABSURD.\n5.  COMMENTING ON GENERAL CHARACTER OF USG- GOP CO- OPERATION ON NARCOTICS,  ISLAM ASSERTED THAT GOP HAD NEVER MOVED SO QUICKLY ON ANY ISSUE AS IT HAD ON  NARCOTICS.  GOP HAD ACTED ALMOST OVERNIGHT TO SHIFT NARCOTICS FROM REVENUE TO ENFORCEMENT MATTER.  ORAKZAI S ACHIEVEMENT IN PULLING TOGETHER NCB,  OBTAINING COOPERA- TION OF ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES,  AND IN DEVELOPING WORKING RELATIONSHIPS WITH US AND UN AGENCIES WAS OUTSTANDING. HE DOUBTED THAT ANY OTHER GOVERNMENT COULD HAVE DONE TO MUCH.  HE EXPRESSED FEAR THAT US NOTE WOULD BE  COUNTER- PRODUCTIVE.  NEVERTHELESS,  THE GOP WOULD CONTINUE TO COOPERATE IN THIS AREA.\n6.  CHARGE STATED THAT EMBASSY NOTE HAD BEEN PRESENTED AFTER CAREFUL CONSIDERATION AND UNDER INSTRUCTIONS FROM WASHINGTON.  IT FOLLOWED SEVERAL EXCHANGES WITH GOP OFFICIALS IN WHICH VIEWS OF BOTH SIDES WERE EXPLORED. HE GREATLY REGRETTED THAT ISLAM CONSIDERED TONE AND CON- TENT OBJECTIONABLE.  INTENT OF NOTE WAS TO STIMULATE MUTUALLY AGREEABLE DECISION WITHIN CONTEXT OF EXISTING CLOSE COOPERATIVE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN BOTH GOVERNMENTS. CHARGE REJECTED CATEGORICALLY IDEA THAT NOTE IMPLIED USG  DESIRE TO DICTATE TO GOP,  POINTING OUT THAT SUCH AN APPROACH WAS NOT IN NATURE OF USG RELATIONSHIP WITH GOP.  CHARGE NOTED THAT IN HIS YEARS IN PAKISTAN HE HAD RECEIVED A LARGE NUMBER OF GOP REQUESTS FOR USG ASSISTANCE OR OTHER ACTION,  SOME VERY INSISTENT,  BUT HAD NEVER CONSIDERED THEM AS REFLECTIVE OF GOP INTENT TO DICTATE WHAT US DECISION SHOULD BE.  USG WAS FULLY COGNIZANT THAT DECISION ON TIMETABLE FOR ELIMINATING POPPY PRODUCTION HAD BROAD RAMIFICATIONS AND WAS EN- TIRELY WITHIN SOVEREIGN JURISDICTION OF PAKISTAN. CHARGE SAID THAT HE WOULD LIKE TO BELIEVE THAT PRIVATE DIS- CUSSIONS BETWEEN OUR GOVERNMENTS COULD CONTINUE TO BE FRANK AND FRIENDLY.  IT HAD BEEN ANTICIPATED THAT RECENT US PROPOSAL WOULD BE SEEN IN THAT LIGHT.  AS ISLAM KNEW, AMERICAN PEOPLE WERE DEEPLY CONCERNED ABOUT INTERNATIONAL ILLICIT FLOW OF NARCOTICS AND THAT EFFECTIVE CONTROL OF THIS FLOW WAS MATTER OF VITAL IMPORTANCE TO US.  CHARGE S SUGGESTION THAT GOP DECISION WOULD PROBABLY HAVE TO BE TAKEN AT HIGH POLITICAL LEVEL WAS MADE SIMPLY IN RECOGNI-  CONFIDENTIAL     TION OF ITS IMPORTANT POLITICAL,  ECONOMIC,  AND SOCIAL IMPLICATIONS.  CHARGE HAD ACTUALLY DISCUSSED NARCOTICS  ISSUE WITH PRES.  BHUTTO ON NUMBER OF OCCASIONS.  CHARGE SAID THAT HE HOPED ISLAM WOULD NOT READ MORE INTO SUG- GESTION THAT GOP DECISION WOULD HAVE TO BE AT POLITICAL LEVEL.\n7.  WITH REGARD TO SPECIFICS OF PROPOSAL,  CHARGE POINTED OUT THAT EMBASSY REPS HAD BEEN DISCUSSING ELIMINATION OF PRODUCTION WITH GOP REPS FOR ALMOST A YEAR.  THERE HAD BEEN INDICATIONS THAT GOP WAS PREPARED TO REDUCE OPIUM PRODUCTION LAST SEASON BY 15  PERCENT,  BUT LICENSED PRO- DUCTION HAD INSTEAD SUBSTANTIALLY INCREASED.  MISSION REPS HAD ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS SUGGESTED THAT GOP ENTER INTO DETAILED DISCUSSIONS WITH USAID REPS ON PLANS FOR ELIMINATING PRODUCTION,  INCLUDING IDENTIFICATION OF ALTERNATIVE CROPS AND RURAL UPLIFT PROGRAM IN POPPY ZONE.  THESE SUGGESTIONS HAD NOT BEEN PICKED UP BY GOP.  IN FACT,  THERE HAD BEEN NO GOP RESPONSE UNTIL HELP- FUL DOCUMENT WHICH ISLAM HAD FORWARDED UNDER COVER OF HIS JUNE 13  LETTER ( REF B).  PROPOSAL FOR IMMEDIATE ELIMINATION OF SETTLED PRODUCTION HAD COME FROM TEAM AND REPRESENTED ITS BEST JUDGMENT ON WHAT SHOULD BE  DONE.  EMBASSY NOTE REFLECTED USG CONCERN ABOUT TIMELI- NESS OF GOP STEPS TO ERADICATE PRODUCTION AND FEAR THAT PROBLEM,  IF NOT FIRMLY ADDRESSED IN NEAR FUTURE,  WOULD BECOME EVEN MORE DIFFICULT TO SOLVE.  CHARGE STATED THAT THIS WAS NOT "" TAKE- IT- OR- LEAVE- IT""  PROPOSAL, BUT WAS OFFERED IN THE HOPE THAT MOST RAPID FEASIBLE TIMETABLE AGREEABLE TO BOTH SIDES COULD BE WORKED OUT. HE ENCOURAGED ISLAM TO GIVE FURTHER CONSIDERATION TO US PROPOSAL IN THIS LIGHT.\n8.  WITH REGARD TO ENFORCEMENT,  CHARGE NOTED THAT MISSION AND NCB WERE MOVING AHEAD ACTIVELY ON DISCUSSION OF US ENFORCEMENT ASSISTANCE.  USG WAS PREPARED TO ACCEPT NCB S POINT AND WAS NOT INSISTING THAT ENFORCEMENT EQUIPMENT BE LIMITED TO FOUR  FIU S.  CHARGE PRESUMED THAT ALLEGED REMARKS BY US OFFICER ABOUT WEAPONS FOR NARCOTICS FORCES,  WHICH ISLAM MENTIONED,  MUST HAVE RE- FERRED TO US ARMS SUPPLY POLICY,  WHICH DOES NOT PERMIT  CONFIDENTIAL     EXPORT OF LETHAL WEAPONS TO EITHER INDIA OR PAKISTAN. SMITH DENIED THAT REMARK ATTRIBUTED TO EMBASSY OFFICER PARA 4  HAD BEEN MADE IN ANY DISCUSSION ON EQUIPMENT ASSISTANCE.  BOTH SIDES AGREED TO DROP FURTHER REFERENCE THIS POINT.\n9.  CHARGE EXPRESSED WARM APPRECIATION FOR ISLAM S PERSONAL INTEREST AND EFFORTS AND ADMIRATION FOR WHAT GOP HAD BEEN ABLE TO ACHIEVE IN FEW MONTHS SINCE FOR- MATION OF NCB.  HE MENTIONED HIS VERY HIGH REGARD FOR ORAKZAI S DEDICATION AND ABILITY.\n0.  ISLAM THANKED CHARGE FOR HIS CLARIFICATION.  HE REITERATED HIS VIEW THAT POLICY OF ABRUPTLY ENDING PRODUCTION WOULD NOT WORK AND WAS OUT OF QUESTION. HE SAID THAT GOP WOULD PROCEED WITH ITS PLANNING, UTILIZING VISITS BY QUENTIN WEST AND UN TEAM. CHARGE MENTIONED THAT EMBASSSY HAD EXPRESSED HOPE THAT DECISION COULD BE MADE IN CONJUNCTION OF BHUTTO VISIT, NOT IN EFFORT TO PRESSURE GOP BUT IN HOPE OF CONTRIBU- TING TO SUCCESS OF VISIT.  ISLAM SAID THAT WHILE HE COULD NOT PREDICT EXACT TIME WHEN GOP PLANNING WOULD BE COMPLETED,  HE ANTICIPATED THAT GOP WOULD BE READY IN COUPLE OF MONTHS AND THEN WOULD INFORM EMBASSY.  CHARGE RESPONDED THAT WE HAD HOPED FOR SOME MORE PRECISE ANSWER THAN PROMISE OF FURTHER PLANNING AND DISCUSSIONS AT LATER DATE.  HE ASKED IF ISLAM MEANT THAT THERE WOULD BE NO STATEME NT ON NARCOTICS IN CONNECTION WITH BHUTTO VISIT.  ISLAM SAID HE DID NOT KNOW,  ALTHOUGH HE ACKNOWLEDGED THAT NARCOTICS WOULD PROBABLY BE TOPIC OF DISCUSSION IN WASHINGTON.  ISLAM CLOSED MEETING WITH STATEMENT THAT GOP DESIRED TO CONTINUE COOPERATION WITH USG IN NAR- COTICS FIELD IN "" MOST MEANINGFUL WAY.""  HE EX- PRESSED CONFIDENCE THAT THESE EFFORTS WOULD MEET WITH SUCCESS.\n1.  COMMENT.  IN CARRYING OUT INSTRUCTIONS FOR FORMAL PROPOSAL TO GOP,  WE HAVE BEEN CONFRONTED WITH REACTION WHICH IS NOT ENTIRELY SURPRISING.  WITH RESPECT TO TEAM RECOMMENDATIONS,  ISLAM HAD PREVIOUSLY INDICATED ( RATHER GRATUITOUSLY)  THAT GOP WOULD GIVE THEM FULL CONSIDERATION BUT THAT IT WOULD MAKE DECISIONS ITSELF ABOUT WHAT TO DO.  HE IS SENSITIVE TO ANY INTIMATION THAT GOP EFFORT, FOR WHICH HE HAS BEEN GIVEN SUPERVISING RESPONSIBILITY BY BHUTTO , IS LESS VIGOROUS OR POSITIVE THAN IT SHOULD BE.  ATTITUDE REFLECTED IN HIS REMARK TO AMB.  HANDLEY REFTEL THAT NOTE WOULD "" END DIALOGUE""  WAS HASTY AND ILL- CONSIDERED;  IT HAS, WE BELIEVE,  ALREADY BEEN MODIFIED BY HIS STATEMENTS TO US. HAVING GOTTEN OFF HIS CHEST WHAT HE WANTED TO SAY AND HAVING HEARD OUR EXPLANATION AND RESPONSE,  WE BELIEVE ISLAM WILL NOW TURN BACK --  EVEN MORE EXPEDITIOUSLY PER- HAPS --  TO TASK OF WORKING OUT TIMETABLE FOR ELIMINATING PRODUCTION AND ATTENDANT ECONOMIC ASSISTANCE PROGRAM. WE CONSIDER IT HIGHLY UNLIKELY GOP WILL GO AHEAD WITH DECISION TO PHASE OUT SETTLED AREA PRODUCTION IMMEDIATELY, BUT IT IS POSSIBLE THAT RECENT EXCHANGES WILL STIMULATE GOP TO RE- EXAMINE NCB PHASE- OUT PLAN ANTICIPATING TWO MORE CROPS IN SETTLED AREAS ( PARA 4,  REF C).

BRAZAO COUNSELOR HAS ALSO CONFIRMED TO ILLING DIFFI- CULTY OF DEALING WITH HIGH- LEVEL VATICAN OFFICIALS.  HE RECENTLY COMMENTED THAT "" SOME OF OUR CONTACTS AT VATICAN ARE SO FAR LEFT THAT ONE COULD EVEN BELIEVE THEY HAD COMMUNIST SYM- PATHIES."" ( COMMENT:  SUCH A HIGHLY EXAGGERATED STATEMENT COULD HARDLY APPLY TO GASPARI WHO ONE OF MOST RESERVED AND POLITICALLY MODERATE FIGURES IN VATICAN ADMINISTRATION.  FOR NORMALLY LACONIC GASPARI TO CRITICIZE PORTUGUESE POLICY SO FORCEFULLY IS IN OUR VIEW A GOOD INDICATION OF DEEP VATICAN CONCERN OVER PORTUGUESE AFRICA AND OF GULF WHICH HAS DEVELOPED BETWEEN HOLY SEE AND GOP.)\n3.  GASPARI CRITICIZED PORTUGUAL S AFRICAN POLICY AND LABELLED CLAIMS OF BIRACIALISM AS PROPAGANDA SMOKESCREEN BEHIND WHICH AFRICANS HAVE VIRTUALLY NO POSSIBILITY OF ASSUMING A REASONABLE POSITION IN SOCIETY AND CERTAINLY NO CHANCE OF ATTAINING MEANINGFUL LEADERSHIP.  SCHOOL SYSTEM AND STRINGENT RULES FOR INTEGRATION MANAGE TO PRECLUDE MOST AFRICANS\n4.  GASPARI SAID HE HAS IMPRESSION THAT PORTUGUESE ARMY,  AT PRICE OF MAINTAINING 100,000  TROOPS IN COLONIES,  HAS MILITARY SITUATION SLIGHTLY MORE UNDER CONTROL THAN IN PAST YEARS.  OTHER FACTORS OPERATING AGAINST LIBERATION MOVEMENTS ARE LOSS OF NUMBER OF PROMINENT LEADERS AND GENERAL DIVISION IN RANKS.  THESE TWO FACTORS,  HOWEVER,  PROBABLY HAVE NOT WEAKENED DETERMINATION OF REBEL LEADERS TO EXPELL PORTUGUESE FROM AFRICA.  GASPARI SAID THAT VATICAN WAS HORRIFIED BY REPORTS OF AN EXTENSIVE MASSACRE OF AFRICANS WHICH TOOK PLACE RECENTLY IN MOZAMBIQUE.  THESE REPORTS WHICH HAVE NOT YET HIT MEDIA COME FROM LOCAL PRIESTS AND INDICATE THAT A NUMBER OF VILLAGES HAVE BEEN ANNIHILATED IN REPRISAL FOR REBEL RAIDS.\n5.  GASPARI CONFIRMED THAT WHEN ZAMBIAN AMBASSADOR PHIRI WAS IN     SECRET\n6.  ACCORDING TO GASPARI,  CRITICAL SITUATION IS DEVELOPING RE MINISTERING TO SPIRITUAL NEEDS OF MANY PORTUGUESE AFRICANS.  AREAS UNDER REBEL CONTROL OFTEN HAVE NO PRIESTS AND PRIESTS WHO ATTEMPT TO ENTER THESE AREAS ARE LABELLED AS ANTI- PORTUGUESE AND TRAITORS BY LOCAL PORTUGUESE AUTHORITIES. THE NUMBER OF FOREIGN MISSIONARIES HAS ALSO FALLEN SHARPLY AND GOP HAS VIRTUALLY HALTED ISSUING VISAS TO REPLACEMENTS.  SPANISH BURGOS FATHERS HAVE ALL BEEN EXPELLED,  HE SAID.  GOP HAS PUT ALL POSSIBLE OBSTACLES IN PATH OF CHURCH S EFFORTS TO TRAIN LOCAL BLACK HIERARCHY.  ONLY BLACK BISHOP IS AUXILIARY AT LUANDA, MSGR.  MUACA,  WHO GASPARI SAID IS FIRST CLASS MAN.   MAIN PERSONNEL PROBLEM FACING VATICAN NOW IS REPLACEMENT OF BISHOP OF BEIRA IN MOZAMBIQUE.  VOLPE\n",912710

( IF GOP COULD CONTROL ILLICIT OUTPUT OF SETTLED AREAS, THERE WOULD BE NO NEED FOR TOTAL BAN ON PRODUCTION.

PLEASE NOTE, HOWEVER,  THAT WE ARE NOT CONTEMPLATING VERY LARGE FINANCIAL INPUT FOR DEVELOPMENT ASPECTS OF NARCOTICS CONTROL.   WE ARE HOWEVER WILLING TO CONSIDER SELECTIVE INPUTS,  PARTICULARLY OF FOREIGN EXCHANGE COSTS ( NOT TO COVER LOSSES FROM ILLICIT EXPORTS) OF UPLIFT PROGRAM FOR AREAS WHERE POPPY CULTIVATION MAKES MAJOR IMPACT ON ECONOMY,  THAT IS PRIMARILY SWABI TEHSIL IN SETTLED DISTRICTS.

IF GOP IS ADAMANT THAT PHASING OUT OF SETTLED AREA PRODUCTION WILL HAVE TO BE DONE OVER SEVERAL YEARS, WE BELIEVE USG SHOULD BE READY WITH FALL- BACK POSITION THAT GOP SHOULD PROCEED WITH ELIMINATION OF LICENSING OVER TWO- YEAR PERIOD IN TWO EQUAL INSTALLMENTS,  LEAVING FOR SECOND YEAR AREA WHERE POPPY CROP IS OF GREATEST IMPORTANCE TO LOCAL ECONOMY.  ACCORDING TO INFORMATION AVAILABLE, HTEHSILS ( SUBDIVISIONS OF DISTRICTS)  IN WHICH LICENSED PRODUCTION HAS OCCURRED CAN BE RANKED IN FOLLOWING ORDER:  ( A)  SWABI ( MARDAN DISTRICT); ( B)  HARIPUR ( HAZARA DISTRICT);  ( C)  CHARSADDA ( PESHAWAR DISTRICT);  ( D)  MARDAN ( MARDAN DISTRICT);  ( E)  MANSEHRA ( MANSEHRA DISTRICT);  ( F)  PESHAWAR ( PESHAWAR DISTRICT); AND ( G)  KOHAT DISTRICT).  STUDY OF VARIOUS SETS OF FIGURES WE HAVE SUGGESTS THAT SLIGHTLY MORE THAN HALF OF TOTAL SETTLED AREA PRODUCTION OCCURS IN SWABI TEHSIL,  WHILE HARIPUR AND CHARSADDA EACH AMOUNT FOR ABOUT 15  PERCENT,  MARDAN 10  PERCENT,  WITH VERY LIMITED LICENSED PRODUCTION IN MANSEHRA,  PESHAWAR AND KOHAT TEHSILS. ( SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT OF HARIPUR CULTIVATION WOULD IN ANY CASE BE ELIMINATED BY THE RISING TARBELA RESERVOIR BY 1974  OR 1975.)   THUS WE SUGGEST THAT -- WHILE PRESSING FOR IMMEDIATE PHASEOUT--  FALL- BACK POSITION SHOULD BE THAT IN 1973-74  SEASON,  LICENSEES SHOULD BE ISSUED FOR PRODUCTION ONLY IN SWABI TEHSIL,  A CUT OF APPROXIMATELY 50  PERCENT,  AND THAT IN 1974-75  NO FURTHER LICENSES SHOULD BE ISSUED.  IN OUR VIEW,  IF GOP COULD IMPLEMENT THIS TWO- YEAR PROGRAM,  THIS WOULD BE REASONABLY  CONFIDENTIAL     SATISFACTORY IF NOT OPTIMUM RESULT.\n7.  ABOVE FALL- BACK SCENARIO FOR SETTLED AREAS -- PROVIDED A FALL- BACK IS NEEDED--  CAN BE JUSTIFIED ON THE FOLLOWING GROUNDS:\n8.

KAUL SAID THAT AID DONORS HAD SHOWN A SYMPATHETIC UNDERSTANDING OF INDIA S PROBLEMS AND HAD RECOGNIZED THAT NON- PROJECT ASSISTANCE  WAS A USEFUL WAY OF EASING INDIA S BALANCE- OF- PAYMENTS STRAINS.  SOME NEWSPAPERS INTERPRETED KAUL S REMARKS TO MEAN THAT CONSORTIUM MAY EXTEND SUPPLEMENTARY ASSISTANCE OVER AND ABOVE $1.1  BILLION FIGURE,  ALTHOUGH KAUL IS REPORTED TO HAVE CAUTIONED THAT "" NOTHING SPECIFIC  WAS MENTIONED ON THE SUBJECT"" ( ECONOMIC TIMES,  JUNE 24).  KAUL SAID THAT FOREIGN EXCHANGE SITUATION WOULD REQUIRE "" CAREFUL HANDLING""  AND NOTED THAT DONORS HAD EXPRESSED THE HOPE THAT GOI WOULD IMPROVE INVESTMENT CLIMATE THROUGH SUCH STEPS AS MORE FLEXIBLE LICENSING POLICIES.  THIS WOULD CONTRIBUTE TO CONDITIONS FOR SUSTAINED RAPID INDUSTRIAL GROWTH. \n3.  KAUL INDICATED THAT ALL MEMBERS OF THE CONSORTIUM EXCEPT THE US HAD EITHER MADE COMMITMENTS OR GIVEN INDICATIONS OF THEIR LIKELY QUANTUM OF AID AT THE MEETING,  ALTHOUGH HE DECLINED TO PROVIDE A COUNTRY- BY- COUNTRY BREAKDOWN.  HE SAID THAT IDA WOULD BE COM-  MITING APPROXIMATELY $500  MILLION. \n4.  KAUL SAID THAT US COMMITMENT OF NEW AID WOULD NOT BE KNOWN UNTIL THE US CONGRESS HAS COMPLETED HEARINGS ON THE USAID BILL FO US FY 1974.  ONLY ONE PAPER NOTED PARENTHETICALLY THAT THE US ADMINISTRATION HAD REQUESTED $75  MILLION FOR INDIA IN ITS 1974   AID REQUEST.  KAUL REPORTED TO HAVE DESCRIBED US ATTITUDE AT MEET-  ING AS "" VERY FRIENDLY""  OR AS "" FRIENDLY AND SYMPATHETIC""  AND TO HAVE STATED THAT US WOULD TAKE PART IN 1973/74  DEBT RELIEF EXERCISE. \n5.  JUNE 16  EDITIONS OF ECONOMIC TIMES AND FINANCIAL EXPRESS CARRIED VIRTUALLY IDENTICAL ARTICLES TO EFFECT THAT US HAD MADE NO COMMITMENT AT CONSORTIUM MEETING BUT HAD INDICATED IT WAS WILLING TO DISCUSS AID REQUIREMENTS BILATERALLY.  ARTICLES SAID THAT US FEELS INDIA LOOKS AT AID FROM WASHINGTON AS "" INCURSIVE"" ( MACDONALD HAD USED THE WORD "" INTRUSIVE""  IN PRIVATE CONVERSATIONS IN PARIS)  AND,  AS SUCH,  THE US IS NOT IN A POSITION TO INITIATE ANY AID COMMITMENT.  ARTICLE CONTINUES THAT "" BUT INFORMED SOURCES SAID THE GENERAL AMERI-   LIMITED OFFICIAL USE      LIMITED OFFICIAL USE     CAN ATTITUDE WAS FRIENDLY IN REGARD TO DEBT RELIEF AND QUITE FAVORABLE."" \n6.  HINDUSTAN TIMES ARTICLE OF JUNE 19  STATES THAT "" THERE IS NO SURPRISE HERE ( STORY IS DATELINED NEW DELHI)  OVER THE POSITION TAKEN BY THE US WHICH HAS NOT MADE ANY COMMITMENT,  AS THE INDIAN DELEGATION DID NOT GO TO PARIS WITH ANY EXPECTATION ON THIS SCORE.  HOWEVER,  IF THE US HAD PLEDGED ECONOMIC AID,  ITS DECLARATION WOULD HAVE BEEN WELCOME.   THE GOVERNMENT S POLICY OF NOT ASKING FOR US AID REMAINS UNCHANGED."" \n7.  EDITORIAL COMMENT ON CONSORTIUM MEETING.  THE STATESMAN OF JUNE\n8.  INDIAN EXPRESS  EDITORIAL OF JUNE 18  ALSO NOTED IMPORTANCE OF DEBT RESCHEDULING.  EDOTORIAL STATES IN PART "" THE HELPFUL PART OF THE PRO-  CEEDINGS IS THE COMPARATIVELY FIRMER CONSENSUS OF THE EXTENT OF RE-  SCHEDULING OF DEBT REPAYMENTS.""  AFTER MENTIONING RECENT AGRICULTURAL SETBACKS IN INDIA,  EDITORIAL INDIRECTLY RAISED THE ISSUE OF CON-  CESSIONAL FOOD AID FROM THE US. "" THIS ( IMPACT OF FOOD SHORTAGE ON INDIAN BALANCE- OF- PAYMENTS)  IS OF DIRECT RELEVANCE TO THE PROSPECTS OF AID FLOW FROM THE US WHICH IS THE MAIN SOURCE FOR FOODGRAIN IMPORTS BY INDIA.""  EDITORIAL SAID THAT REPORTED US ATTITUDE THAT INDIA INITIATE DISCUSSIONS ON A RESUMPTION OF US AID "" RAISES SOME  LIMITED OFFICIAL USE      LIMITED OFFICIAL USE     SENSITIVE PROBLEMS""  WHICH EDITORIAL DID NOT ELABORATE UPON. \n9.  EDITORIAL IN JUNE 18  FINANCIAL EXPRESS NOTES THAT EXPECTED NET AID OF $260  MILLION IN IFY 73/74  FALLS FAR SHORT OF MOF BUDGET ESTIMATE OF RS. 400  CRORES ($535  MILLION)  IN NET AID DURING CURRENT IFY.  EDITORIAL NOTES THAT SCARCITY OF FOREIGN EXCHANGE WILL BE A MAJOR CONSTRAINT ON INDIA S DEVELOPMENT REGARDLESS OF THE AMOUNT OF AID RECEIVED,  AND THAT THIS CAN BE OVERCOME ONLY IF INDIA GENERATES SUFFICIENT EXPORT SURPLUSES.  EDITORIAL CONCLUDES THAT INDIA "" SHOULD  NOT DEPEND ON THE MAGNANIMITY OF OUR CREDITORS...  FOR A SELF-  RESPECTING COUNTRY THAT PRETENDS TO MOVE TOWARD ZERO AID,  THERE IS NO ESCAPE FROM PUTTING ITS HOUSE IN ORDER."" \n0.  MOTHERLAND ( RIGHT- WING NATIONALIST)  EDITORIAL TOOK AN EXAGGERATED VIEW OF US IMPORTANCE IN CONSORTIUM BY SAYING THAT "" UNLESS HE ( INDIAN AMBASSADOR TO WASHINGTON T. N.  KAUL)  IS ABLE TO PERSUADE WASHINGTON TO LOOSEN ITS PURSE STRINGS,  NEW DELHI S UBIQUITOUS BETGING BOWL WILL BE AS EMPTY AS EVER,  THE WORLD BANK NOTWITHSTANDING."" \n1.

SUMMARY QAMARUL ISLAM INFORMED CHARGE THAT US NOTE WAS CONSIDERED OBJECTIONABLE ATTEMPT TO DICTATE GOP DECISION ON ELIMINATING OPIUM PRODUCTION.  HE SAID THAT IMMEDIATE ELIMINATION OF SETTLED PRODUCTION WAS IMPOSSIBLE.  GOP HAD INITIATED COMPREHENSIVE PLANNING PROCESS DESIGNED TO SOLVE RATHER THAN APPLY COSMETICS TO PROBLEM.  CHARGE REGRETTED ISLAM S INTERPRETATION OF NOTE,  EMPHASIZING LACK OF INTENT TO DICTATE ANYTHING ANT THAT IT WAS NOT "" TAKE- IT- OR- LEAVE- IT""  PROPOSAL.  HE REVIEWED EARLIER USG EFFORTS TO ENCOURAGE GOP PRODUC- TION PLANNING,  AND URGED FURTHER CONSIDERATION OF USG PROPOSAL AND POSSIBLE ALTERNATIVES.  WHILE INDICATING THAT GOP WOULD PROBABLY NOT COMPLETE PLANNING FOR AT LEAST TWO MONTHS,  ISLAM DID NOT RULE OUT POSSIBILITY OF SOME STATEMENT IN CONNECTION WITH BHUTTO VI IT. GOP DECISION FOR IMMEDIATE ELIMINATION OF SETTLED AREA PRODUCTION IS UNLIKELY,  BUT WE ARE HOPEFUL THAT RECENT EXCHANGES WITH ISLAM WILL ENCOURAGE GOP TO REEXAMINE ITS EARLIER THREE- YEAR TIMETABLE.  END SUMMARY.\n2.  QAMARUL ISLAM ( DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,  PLANNING COMMISSION) CALLED IN CHARGE JUNE 28  FOR DISCUSSION OF EMBASSY NOTE ON TIMETABLE FOR ELIMINATION OF OPIUM PRODUCTION.  MISSION NARCOTICS COORDINATOR ( SMITH)  ACCOMPANIED,  WHILE MFA DIR.  GEN.  ZAKI AND ORAKZAI SAT IN FOR GOP.  REFERRING TO HIS MEETING WITH AMB.  HANDLEY,  ISLAM SAID THAT "" HE HAD THROWN UP HIS HANDS IN HORROR""  WHEN HE WAS SHOWN COPY OF NOTE.  HE SAID THAT "" WE""  FOUND NOTE "" VERY OBJECTIONABLE"" BOTH IN TONE AND SUBSTANCE.  HE STATED THAT DICTATION OF TIMETABLE FOR GOP TO ELIMINATE OPIUM PRODUCTION BY USG OR ANY OTHER GOVERNMENT WAS OUT OF QUESTION.  REFERRING TO CHARGE S CONVERSATION WITH ZAK WHEN NOTE HAD BEEN PRESENTED ( REF C),  ISLAM ALSO TOOK EXCEPTION TO ALLEGED SUGGESTION THAT PROPOSAL CONTAINED IN NOTE BE DEALT WITH BY CABINET MINISTER.\n3.  AS TO SUBSTANCE,  ISLAM SAID PROPOSAL "" HAD NO MEANING""  BECAUSE IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE TO FULFILL. DECISION TO IMPLEMENT IT WOULD BE PURELY COSMETIC. GOP WISHED "" TO SOLVE PROBLEM,  NOT TINKER WITH IT."" PLANNING FOR ELIMINATION OF PRODUCTION NECESSITATED CONSIDERATION OF A BROAD RANGE OF ISSUES INCLUDING COMPENSATION,  ALTERNATIVE CROPS,  PROVISION OF FERTILIZER AND SEEDS,  AND CONSTRUCTION OF DAMS AND ROADS.  SUCH PLANNING REQUIRED THAT VIEWS OF THE PEOPLE AFFECTED RECEIVE CAREFUL ATTENTION.  HE SAID HE HAD INDICATED AT FINAL MEETING WITH US NARCOTICS TEAM ON FEB.  1  THAT IT WOULD TAKE TIME  TO PREPARE PEOPLE OF COUNTRY FOR THIS IMPORTANT STEP .  HE REMARKED THAT THIS MESSAGE APPEARED TO HAVE BEEN LOST UPON TEAM DESPITE EXCEPTIONAL CALIBER OF ITS WORK.  HE STATED GOP WAS IN PROCESS OF FORMULATING COMPREHENSIVE PLANS TO DEAL WITH PRODUCTION PHASEOUT WHICH WOULD BE PROCESSED AT EXPEDITIOUSLY AS POSSIBLE.  PLANS FOR MERGED AND TRIBAL AREAS WOULD FOLLOW FROM PLANS FOR SETTLED AREAS AND WOULD HAVE TO BE DRAWN UP WITH GREAT CAUTION.  QUESTION OF COMPENSATION FOR LOSS OF INCOME AND REVENUE FROM OPIUM PRODUCTION HAD NOT YET BEEN FULLY ADDRESSED,  BUT LARGE AMOUNTS OF MONEY WOULD BE REQUIRED TO COMPENSATE INDIVIDUAL FARMERS AND PROVINCIAL GOVERNMENTS,  AND TO FUND NEW FACILITIES AND INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS IN NWFP.  GOP WELCOMED VISIT OF  CONFIDENTIAL\n4.  DIGRESSING FROM CONTENTS OF NOTE,  ISLAM REMARKED THAT SUPPRESSION OF NARCOTICS TRAFFICKING WOULD REQUIRE LARGE NUMBERS OF ENFORCEMENT UNITS,  PERHAPS EVENTUALLY TOTAL OF SEVERAL HUNDRED.  US TEAM HAD PROPOSED FOUR, WHICH WAS COMPLETELY INADEQUATE.  NCB WAS NOT PROPOSING TO BEGIN WITH 25  FIELD INVESTIGATIVE UNITS ( FIU S). ISLAM NOTED THAT EARLIER NCB LIST OF EQUIPMENT REQUIRE-. MENTS PASSED TO EMBASSY HAD INCLUDED 75  REVOLVERS,  150 RIFLES AND 50  STEN GUNS.  ISLAM CLAIMED HE HAD BEEN IN- FORMED THAT AN EMBASSY OFFICER HAD TOLD NCB THAT PROVISION OF SUCH WEAPONS WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE BECAUSE IT WOULD BE "" THREAT TO SECURITY OF INDIA"",  WHICH HE BELIEVED WAS ABSURD.\n5.  COMMENTING ON GENERAL CHARACTER OF USG- GOP CO- OPERATION ON NARCOTICS,  ISLAM ASSERTED THAT GOP HAD NEVER MOVED SO QUICKLY ON ANY ISSUE AS IT HAD ON  NARCOTICS.  GOP HAD ACTED ALMOST OVERNIGHT TO SHIFT NARCOTICS FROM REVENUE TO ENFORCEMENT MATTER.  ORAKZAI S ACHIEVEMENT IN PULLING TOGETHER NCB,  OBTAINING COOPERA- TION OF ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES,  AND IN DEVELOPING WORKING RELATIONSHIPS WITH US AND UN AGENCIES WAS OUTSTANDING. HE DOUBTED THAT ANY OTHER GOVERNMENT COULD HAVE DONE TO MUCH.  HE EXPRESSED FEAR THAT US NOTE WOULD BE  COUNTER- PRODUCTIVE.  NEVERTHELESS,  THE GOP WOULD CONTINUE TO COOPERATE IN THIS AREA.\n6.  CHARGE STATED THAT EMBASSY NOTE HAD BEEN PRESENTED AFTER CAREFUL CONSIDERATION AND UNDER INSTRUCTIONS FROM WASHINGTON.  IT FOLLOWED SEVERAL EXCHANGES WITH GOP OFFICIALS IN WHICH VIEWS OF BOTH SIDES WERE EXPLORED. HE GREATLY REGRETTED THAT ISLAM CONSIDERED TONE AND CON- TENT OBJECTIONABLE.  INTENT OF NOTE WAS TO STIMULATE MUTUALLY AGREEABLE DECISION WITHIN CONTEXT OF EXISTING CLOSE COOPERATIVE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN BOTH GOVERNMENTS. CHARGE REJECTED CATEGORICALLY IDEA THAT NOTE IMPLIED USG  DESIRE TO DICTATE TO GOP,  POINTING OUT THAT SUCH AN APPROACH WAS NOT IN NATURE OF USG RELATIONSHIP WITH GOP.  CHARGE NOTED THAT IN HIS YEARS IN PAKISTAN HE HAD RECEIVED A LARGE NUMBER OF GOP REQUESTS FOR USG ASSISTANCE OR OTHER ACTION,  SOME VERY INSISTENT,  BUT HAD NEVER CONSIDERED THEM AS REFLECTIVE OF GOP INTENT TO DICTATE WHAT US DECISION SHOULD BE.  USG WAS FULLY COGNIZANT THAT DECISION ON TIMETABLE FOR ELIMINATING POPPY PRODUCTION HAD BROAD RAMIFICATIONS AND WAS EN- TIRELY WITHIN SOVEREIGN JURISDICTION OF PAKISTAN. CHARGE SAID THAT HE WOULD LIKE TO BELIEVE THAT PRIVATE DIS- CUSSIONS BETWEEN OUR GOVERNMENTS COULD CONTINUE TO BE FRANK AND FRIENDLY.  IT HAD BEEN ANTICIPATED THAT RECENT US PROPOSAL WOULD BE SEEN IN THAT LIGHT.  AS ISLAM KNEW, AMERICAN PEOPLE WERE DEEPLY CONCERNED ABOUT INTERNATIONAL ILLICIT FLOW OF NARCOTICS AND THAT EFFECTIVE CONTROL OF THIS FLOW WAS MATTER OF VITAL IMPORTANCE TO US.  CHARGE S SUGGESTION THAT GOP DECISION WOULD PROBABLY HAVE TO BE TAKEN AT HIGH POLITICAL LEVEL WAS MADE SIMPLY IN RECOGNI-  CONFIDENTIAL     TION OF ITS IMPORTANT POLITICAL,  ECONOMIC,  AND SOCIAL IMPLICATIONS.  CHARGE HAD ACTUALLY DISCUSSED NARCOTICS  ISSUE WITH PRES.  BHUTTO ON NUMBER OF OCCASIONS.  CHARGE SAID THAT HE HOPED ISLAM WOULD NOT READ MORE INTO SUG- GESTION THAT GOP DECISION WOULD HAVE TO BE AT POLITICAL LEVEL.\n7.  WITH REGARD TO SPECIFICS OF PROPOSAL,  CHARGE POINTED OUT THAT EMBASSY REPS HAD BEEN DISCUSSING ELIMINATION OF PRODUCTION WITH GOP REPS FOR ALMOST A YEAR.  THERE HAD BEEN INDICATIONS THAT GOP WAS PREPARED TO REDUCE OPIUM PRODUCTION LAST SEASON BY 15  PERCENT,  BUT LICENSED PRO- DUCTION HAD INSTEAD SUBSTANTIALLY INCREASED.  MISSION REPS HAD ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS SUGGESTED THAT GOP ENTER INTO DETAILED DISCUSSIONS WITH USAID REPS ON PLANS FOR ELIMINATING PRODUCTION,  INCLUDING IDENTIFICATION OF ALTERNATIVE CROPS AND RURAL UPLIFT PROGRAM IN POPPY ZONE.  THESE SUGGESTIONS HAD NOT BEEN PICKED UP BY GOP.  IN FACT,  THERE HAD BEEN NO GOP RESPONSE UNTIL HELP- FUL DOCUMENT WHICH ISLAM HAD FORWARDED UNDER COVER OF HIS JUNE 13  LETTER ( REF B).  PROPOSAL FOR IMMEDIATE ELIMINATION OF SETTLED PRODUCTION HAD COME FROM TEAM AND REPRESENTED ITS BEST JUDGMENT ON WHAT SHOULD BE  DONE.  EMBASSY NOTE REFLECTED USG CONCERN ABOUT TIMELI- NESS OF GOP STEPS TO ERADICATE PRODUCTION AND FEAR THAT PROBLEM,  IF NOT FIRMLY ADDRESSED IN NEAR FUTURE,  WOULD BECOME EVEN MORE DIFFICULT TO SOLVE.  CHARGE STATED THAT THIS WAS NOT "" TAKE- IT- OR- LEAVE- IT""  PROPOSAL, BUT WAS OFFERED IN THE HOPE THAT MOST RAPID FEASIBLE TIMETABLE AGREEABLE TO BOTH SIDES COULD BE WORKED OUT. HE ENCOURAGED ISLAM TO GIVE FURTHER CONSIDERATION TO US PROPOSAL IN THIS LIGHT.\n8.  WITH REGARD TO ENFORCEMENT,  CHARGE NOTED THAT MISSION AND NCB WERE MOVING AHEAD ACTIVELY ON DISCUSSION OF US ENFORCEMENT ASSISTANCE.  USG WAS PREPARED TO ACCEPT NCB S POINT AND WAS NOT INSISTING THAT ENFORCEMENT EQUIPMENT BE LIMITED TO FOUR  FIU S.  CHARGE PRESUMED THAT ALLEGED REMARKS BY US OFFICER ABOUT WEAPONS FOR NARCOTICS FORCES,  WHICH ISLAM MENTIONED,  MUST HAVE RE- FERRED TO US ARMS SUPPLY POLICY,  WHICH DOES NOT PERMIT  CONFIDENTIAL     EXPORT OF LETHAL WEAPONS TO EITHER INDIA OR PAKISTAN. SMITH DENIED THAT REMARK ATTRIBUTED TO EMBASSY OFFICER PARA 4  HAD BEEN MADE IN ANY DISCUSSION ON EQUIPMENT ASSISTANCE.  BOTH SIDES AGREED TO DROP FURTHER REFERENCE THIS POINT.\n9.  CHARGE EXPRESSED WARM APPRECIATION FOR ISLAM S PERSONAL INTEREST AND EFFORTS AND ADMIRATION FOR WHAT GOP HAD BEEN ABLE TO ACHIEVE IN FEW MONTHS SINCE FOR- MATION OF NCB.  HE MENTIONED HIS VERY HIGH REGARD FOR ORAKZAI S DEDICATION AND ABILITY.\n0.  ISLAM THANKED CHARGE FOR HIS CLARIFICATION.  HE REITERATED HIS VIEW THAT POLICY OF ABRUPTLY ENDING PRODUCTION WOULD NOT WORK AND WAS OUT OF QUESTION. HE SAID THAT GOP WOULD PROCEED WITH ITS PLANNING, UTILIZING VISITS BY QUENTIN WEST AND UN TEAM. CHARGE MENTIONED THAT EMBASSSY HAD EXPRESSED HOPE THAT DECISION COULD BE MADE IN CONJUNCTION OF BHUTTO VISIT, NOT IN EFFORT TO PRESSURE GOP BUT IN HOPE OF CONTRIBU- TING TO SUCCESS OF VISIT.  ISLAM SAID THAT WHILE HE COULD NOT PREDICT EXACT TIME WHEN GOP PLANNING WOULD BE COMPLETED,  HE ANTICIPATED THAT GOP WOULD BE READY IN COUPLE OF MONTHS AND THEN WOULD INFORM EMBASSY.  CHARGE RESPONDED THAT WE HAD HOPED FOR SOME MORE PRECISE ANSWER THAN PROMISE OF FURTHER PLANNING AND DISCUSSIONS AT LATER DATE.  HE ASKED IF ISLAM MEANT THAT THERE WOULD BE NO STATEME NT ON NARCOTICS IN CONNECTION WITH BHUTTO VISIT.  ISLAM SAID HE DID NOT KNOW,  ALTHOUGH HE ACKNOWLEDGED THAT NARCOTICS WOULD PROBABLY BE TOPIC OF DISCUSSION IN WASHINGTON.  ISLAM CLOSED MEETING WITH STATEMENT THAT GOP DESIRED TO CONTINUE COOPERATION WITH USG IN NAR- COTICS FIELD IN "" MOST MEANINGFUL WAY.""  HE EX- PRESSED CONFIDENCE THAT THESE EFFORTS WOULD MEET WITH SUCCESS.\n1.  COMMENT.  IN CARRYING OUT INSTRUCTIONS FOR FORMAL PROPOSAL TO GOP,  WE HAVE BEEN CONFRONTED WITH REACTION WHICH IS NOT ENTIRELY SURPRISING.  WITH RESPECT TO TEAM RECOMMENDATIONS,  ISLAM HAD PREVIOUSLY INDICATED ( RATHER GRATUITOUSLY)  THAT GOP WOULD GIVE THEM FULL CONSIDERATION BUT THAT IT WOULD MAKE DECISIONS ITSELF ABOUT WHAT TO DO.  HE IS SENSITIVE TO ANY INTIMATION THAT GOP EFFORT, FOR WHICH HE HAS BEEN GIVEN SUPERVISING RESPONSIBILITY BY BHUTTO , IS LESS VIGOROUS OR POSITIVE THAN IT SHOULD BE.

AFTER SPEECHES ON OWN GOVERNMENT S VIEW OF WORLD SITUATION,  EACH FOCUSING PRIMARILY ON CENTO S ROLE IN REGION AND PAKISTAN S FUTURE ROLE IN CENTO,  PAKISTANI MINSTATE AHMED AND SECRETARY ROGERS EACH SPOKE IN REPLY.   GENERAL DISCUSSION FOLLOWED.      SECRET     2.   TURKISH FOREIGN MINISTER BAYULKEN SAID HE WAS HAPPY TO HEAR SUCH SINCERE EXCHANGE .   HE WAS SURE PAK SAGACITY WOULD CONSIDER ALL THINGS.   HE THEN OFFERED A "" POSSIBLY FAR- FETCHED SUGGESTION:""   CENTO MEMBERS,  ESPECIALLY ONE WHO SUFFERED AS RESULT OF OTHER MATTERS,  WERE INTERESTED IN EXPRESSION OF US CONCERN FOR THEIR SOVEREIGNTY.   COULD WE LEAVE MEETING BELIEVING THAT TERRITORIAL INTEGRITY OF ALL MEMBERS WAS OF HIGHEST IMPORTANCE,  THAT IF ANY REGIONAL MEMBER WAS OBJECT OF OPEN AGGRESSION,  THIS ORGANIZATION WOULD"" SHOW ITS TEETH""?    HE GRANTED THAT INDIVIDUAL MEMBERS WOULD HAVE TO TAKE CARE OF MANY THINGS BY SELVES.   FOR INSTANCE,  IF ONE DID NOT SHOW SUFFICIENT CONCERN FOR SUB-  VERSION,  ONE MIGHT NOT SEE COVERT AGGRESSION.  BUT,  TURK   MINISTER CONCLUDED,  IF WE LEAVE HERE KNOWING WE ARE PROTECTED AGAINST NAKED AGGRESSION,  THEN THIS WILL INDEED HAVE BEEN PRODUCTIVE MEETING.   \n4.   BRITISH SECSTATE FCO REMINDED MINISTERS THAT VERY FEW PEOPLE IN EUROPE IMMEDIATELY POST- WW II,  WHEN RUSSIA REVEALED ITS EXPANSION INTENTIONS,  WOULD HAVE BELIEVED EUROPE COULD ESCAPE WITHOUT LOSING TERRITORY.   YET NATO WAS CREATED AND NOT A YARD OF TERRITORY HAS BEEN LOST,  NOT A SINGLE MAN S LIFE HAS BEEN LOST.   \n5.   IN BRITAIN,  MANY QUESTION WHY BRITAIN SHOULD STAY IN SEATO,  CENTO,  NATO WHEN BRITAIN S OVERSEAS COMMITMENTS WERE SO REDUCED AND HER NATIONAL BUDGET SO STRAINED.  SUCCESSFUL ANSWER IS THAT BRITAIN HAS RETURNED UNITS TO SINGAPORE AND STILL HAS A MILITARY PRESENCE IN PERSIAN GULF.   DETERRENT OF WEST PROBABLY SAVED IRAN,  EVEN PAKISTAN.   DOUGLAS- HOME HARKED BACK TO EARLIER SECSTATE REMARK AND SAID SUCH RESULT WAS "" GREATEST THING IN OUR LIVES.""   FROM SUCH EXAMPLE,  WE MUSTN T EVEN THINK OF "" DODGING ENTANGLEMENTS"".   \n6.   IN VERY BRIEF REBUTTAL TO PAK EXPRESSION OF COMPLETE DISTRUST OF INDIAN SINCERITY IN DESIRE FOR PEACE,  SIR ALEC NOTED THAT INDIANS ARE "" INDEPENDENT MINDED""  AND     SECRET      IT WAS NOT IN THEIR CHARACTER TO LET THEMSELVES BECOME CONTROLLED BY SOVIETS.   MRS.  GANDHI HAS GONE ON PUBLIC RECORD THAT SHE SINCERELY DOES WISH TO SETTLE DIFFERENCES WITH PAKISTAN.   PAKISTAN MUST NEGOTIATE TO PROVE THIS.   \n7.   RETURNING TO CONCEPT OF ALLIANCE,  BRITISH MINISTER URGED REGIONAL PARTNERS NOT TO UNDERESTIMATE DETERRENT OF WEST S INTEREST IN THEIR WELL- BEING.   BUT DIRECT MILITARY ATTACK SEEMED OUT OF PICTURE,  AND ALLIANCE SHOULD MOVE ON TO CONSIDER HOW TO STRENGTHEN COUNTER-  SUBVERSION.   WEST MUST STILL WORK HARD TO HELP OTHS DEFEND SELVES THROUGH MUTUAL SECURITY ARRANGEMENTS.   \n8.   PAK MINISTER INTERVENED AGAIN TO ASSURE MINISTERS PAKISTAN DID NOT RPT NOT DENY IMPORTANCE OF ALLIANCES,  BILATERAL OR MULTILATERAL.   BUT HE SAID MANY PEOPLE QUESTION PROMOTION OF PEACE BY MILITARY ALLIANCES.   GOP DOES BELIEVE ALLIANCES HAVE  VALUE,  BUT HE FELT PROBLEM IN CENTO WAS NATURE RPT NATURE OF ALLIANCE,  NOT RPT NOT PRINCIPLE.   IT CAN BE DETERRENT BUT WAR IS PREVENTED BY MANY CONSIDERATIONS OF WHICH CENTO MAY HAVE BEEN ONE,  BUT WAS NOT RPT NOT DECISIVE.   ALSO NATO AND CENTO ARE DIFFERENT.   CENTO CANNOT DO IN REGION WHAT NATO DID IN   EUROPE.   WAY IN WHICH CENTO IS STRUCTURED,  IT DID NOTHING RPT NOTHING WHEN IT WAS NEEDED.   \n9.   MINISTER SAID HE WAS ALREADY CONSCIOUS OF FACTS PRESENTED BY US,  GROWING ISOLATIONIST ATTITUDES,  ES-  PECIALLY IN CONGRESS.   IT WOULD BE MISFORTUNE FOR WORLD,  HE SAID,  IF ISOLATIONISM GOT UPPER HAND.   PAKISTAN WOULD DO NOTHING TO EMBARRASS US.   BUT CENTO AS PRESENTLY STRUCTURED,  AS SHOWN BY PAST EXPERIENCE,  IS INCAPABLE OF PROTECTING TERRITORY OF MEMBER.   ONE HALF OF PAKISTAN DISAPPEARED AND CENTO DIDN T EVEN FROWN,  IT WAS UNABLE DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT,  AT LEAST AS CENTO.   HE ADMITTED US WAS INSTRUMENTAL IN BRINGING QUICK END TO WAR.   \n0.   PAKS WANT TO PUT TEETH IN CENTO.  IT MUST BE RESTRUC-  TURED,  IT MUST DEFINE ITS OBJECTIVES.   MINISTER WOULD LIKE     SECRET      TO SEE CENTO STRENGTHENED BY DEFINING NEW KIND OF ALLIANCE,  ALTHOUGH THAT MIGHT,  OR EVEN WOULD,  HAVE ADVERSE CONSE-  QUENCES FOR DETENTE.   \n1.   SECRETARY ROGERS SAID IT WAS IMPORTANT FOR PAK MINISTER TO KEEP IN MIND US POLICY ON ALL ANCES -  ALL ALLIANCES.   NATO IS DIFFERENT FROM CENTO.  BUT IF ALLIANCES START TO UNWIND,  MOST UNFORTUNATE SERIES OF EVENTS COULD START.   \n2.   POLICY OF ALLIANCES GENERALLY SUCCESSFUL,  SECRETARY SAID.   THEY CANNOT SOLVE ALL PROBLEMS,   BUT THEY DO PLAY A POSITIVE ROLE,  SO WHY CHANGE.   IF THERE HAS BEEN MEASURE OF SUCCESS,  ALLIANCE IS WORTH KEEPING.  IT IS NOT NECESSARY TO HAVE PUBLIC REDEFINITION OF ALLIANCE,  BUT WE MUST SETTLE IN OUR OWN MINDS WHAT NEW DEFINITION WE  WANT.   IF POSSIBILITY OF NUCLEAR WAR NOW REMOTE,  SUBVERSION WILL GROW,  SO LET US DEAL WITH THAT.  BUT LET US DO IT IN SESSIONS LIKE THIS MINISTERIAL,  NOT RPT NOT PUBLICLY.   WE SHOULD NOT RPT NOT TALK OF CENTO AS SINGLE ITEM,  BUT AS PART OF AN ALLIANCE SYSTEM.   IF WE ARE HAVING TROUBLE MAINTAINING THE ALLIANCE,  LETS DEAL WITH OUR PROBLEMS AS QUIETLY AND EFFECTIVELY AS POSSIBLE.   \n3.   AS DEBATE WOUND DOWN,  SECRETARY ROGERS AND BRITISH MINISTER SUGGESTED INCLUSION IN FINAL COMMUNIQUE OF REAFFIRMATION OF ALLIANCE S CONCERN FOR INDEPENDENCE AND TERRITORIAL INTEGRITY OF MEMBER STATES.   PAKISTANIS AND OTHER REGIONALS WERE VERY PLEASED TO AGREE AND APPROPRIATE LANGUAGE WAS INCLUDED.   \n4.

GENERAL DIS-   CUSSION FOLLOWED.  END FYI\n2.  TURKISH FOREIGN MINISTER BAYULKEN SAID HE WAS HAPPY TO HEAR SUCH SINCERE EXCHANGE.  HE WAS SURE PAK SAGACITY WOULD CONSIDER ALL THINGS.  HE THEN      SECRET      OFFERED A "" POSSIBLY FAR- FETCHED SUGGESTION:""  CENTO  MEMBERS,  ESPECIALLY ONE WHO SUFFERED AS RESULT OF OTHER MATTERS,  WERE INTERESTED IN EXPRESSION OF US CONCERN FOR THEIR SOVEREIGNTY.  COULD WE LEAVE MEETING BELIEVING THAT TERRITORIAL INTEGRITY OF ALL MEMBERS  WAS OF HIGHEST IMPORTANCE,  THAT IF ANY REGIONAL  MEMBER WAS OBJECT OF OPEN AGRESSION,  THIS ORGANIZA-   TION WOULD "" SHOW ITS TEETH""?  \n3.  HE GRANTED THAT INDIVIDUAL MEMBERS WOULD HAVE TO  TAKE CARE OF MANY THINGS BY SELVES.  FOR INSTANCE,   IF ONE DID NOT SHOW SUFFICIENT CONCERN FOR SUBVER-   SION,  ONE MIGHT NOT SEE COVERT AGGRESSION.  BUT,   TURK MINISTER CONCLUDED,  IF WE LEAVE HERE KNOWING WE AREPROTECTED AGAINST NAKED AGGRESSION,  THEN THIS WILL INDEED HAVE BEEN PRODUCTIVE MEETING*  \n4.  BRITISH SECSTATE FCO REMINDED MINISTERS THAT VERY  FEW PEOPLE IN EUROPE IMMEDIATELY POST- WW II,  WHEN  RUSSIHSREVEALED ITS EXPANSION INTENTIONS,   WOULD HAVE BELIEVED DUROPE COULD ESCAPE WITHOUT LOSING TERRITORY.  YET NATO WAS CREATED AND NOT A  YARD OF TERRITORY HAS BEEN LOST,  NOT A SINGLE MAN S LIFE HAS BEEN LOST.  \n5.  IN BRITAIN,  MANY QUESTION WHY BRITAIN SHOULD STAY IN SEATO,  CENTO,  NATO WHEN BRITAIN S OVERSEAS COMMITMENTS WERE SO REDUCED AND HER NATIONAL BUDGET  SO STRAINED.  SUCCESSFUL ANSWER IS THAT BRITAIN HAS  RETURNED UNITS TO SINGAPORE ANBSTILL HAS A MILITARY  PRSENCE IN PERSIAN GULF.  DETERRENT OF WEST PROBABLY  SAVED IRAN,  EVEN PAKISTAN.  DOUGLAS- HOME HARKED BACK  TO EARLIER SECSTATE REMARK AND SAID SUCH RESULT WAS  "" GREATEST THING IN OUR LIVES.""  FROM SUCH EXAMPLE,   WE MUSTN T ELN THINK OF "" DODGING ENTAGLEMENTS"".  \n6.  IN VERY BRIEF REBUTTAL FO PAK EXPRESSION OF COMPLETE DISTRUST OF INDIAN SINCERITY IN DESIRE FOR PEACE,   SIR ALEC NOTED THAT INDIANS ARE "" INDEPENDENT MINDED""   AND IT WAS NOT IN THEIR CHARACTER TO LET THEMSELVES  BECOME CONTROLLED BY SOVIETS.  MRS.  GANDHI HAS GONE     SECRET      ON PUBLIC RECORD THAT SHE SINCERELY DOES WISH TO  SETTLE DIFFERENCES WITH PAKISTAN.  PAKISTAN MUST NEGOTIATE TO PROVE THIS.  \n7.  RETURNING TO CONCEPT OF ALLIANCE,  BRITISH MINISTER  URGED REGIONAL PARTNERS NOT TO UNDERESTIMATE DETERRENT OF WEST S INTERST IN THEIR WELL- BEING.  BUT DIRECT  MILITARY ATTACK SEEMED OUT OF PICTURE,  AND ALLIANCE SHOULD MOVE ON TO CONSIDER HOW TO STRENGTHEN COUNTER-   SUBVERSION.  WEST MUST STILL WORK HARD TO HELP OTHERS DEFEND SELVES THROUGH MUTUAL SECURITY ARRANGE-   MENTS.  \n8.  PAK MINISTER INTERVENED AGAIN TO ASSURE MINISTERS  PAKISTAN DID NOT RPT NOT DENY IMPORTANCE OF ALLIANCES,   BILATERAL OR MULTILATERAL.  BUT HE SAID MANY PEOPLE QUESTION PROMOTION OF PEACE BY MILITARY ALLIANCES.   GOP DOES BELIEVE ALLIANCES HAVE VALUE,  BUT HE CELT PROBLEM IN CENTO WAS NATURE RPT NATURE OF ALLIANCE,   NOT RPT NO PRINCIPLE.  IT CAN BE DETERRENT,  BUT  WAR IS PREVENTED BY MANY CONSIDERATIONS OF WHICH  CENTO MAY HAVE BEEN ONE,  BUT WAS NOT RPT NOT DECISIVE.   ALSO NATO AND CENTO ARE DIFFERENT.  CENTO CANNOT DO IN REGION WHAT NATO DID IN EUROPE.  WAY IN WHICH  CENTO IS STRUCTURED,  IT DID NOTHING RPT NOTHING WHEN  IT WAS NEEDED.  \n9.  MINISTER SAID HE WAS ALREADY CONSCIOUS OF FACTS PREENTED BY US,  GROWING ISOLATIONIST ATTITUDES,   ESPECIALLY IN CONGRESS.  IT WOULD BE MISFORTUNE FOR WORLD,  HE SAID,  IF ISOLATIONISM GOT UPPER HAND.   PAKISTAN WOULD DO NOTHING TO EMBARRASS US.  BUT CENTO AS PRESENTLY STRUCTURED,  AS SHOWN BY PAST  EXPERIENCE,  IS INCAPABLE OF PROTECTING TERRITORY OF MEMBER.  ONE HALF OF PAKISTAN DISAPPEARED AND CENTO  DIDN T EVEN FROWN,  IT WAS UNABLE DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT,  AT LEAST AS CENTO.  HE ADMITTED US WAS  INSTRUMENTAL IN BRINGING QUICK END TO WAR.  \n0.  PAKS WANT TO PUT TEETH IN CENTO.  IT MUST BE      SECRET      RESTRUCTURED,  IT MUST DEFINE ITS OBJECTIVES.   MINISTER WOLD LIKE TO SEE CENTO STRENGTHENED  BY DEFINING NEW KIND OF ALLIANCE,  ALTHOUGH THAT  MIGHT,  OR EVEN WOULD,  HAVE ADVERSE CONSEQUENCES FOR DETENTE.  \n1.  SECRETARY ROGERS SAID IT WAS IMPORTANT FOR PAK  MINISTER TO KEEP IN MIND US POLIT ON AFJIMCES--  ALL ALLIANCES.  NATO IS DIFFERENT FROM CENTO.  MAYBE ITS CONTRIBUTION TO PEACE GREATER.  BUT IF ALLIANCES START TO UNWIND,  MOST UNFORTUNATE SERIES OF EVENTS,   COULD START.  \n2.  POLICY OF ALLIANCES GENERALLY SUCCESSFUL,   SECRETARY SAID.  THEY CANNOT SOLVE ALL PROBLEMS,  HE ADMITTED,  BUT THEY DO PLAY A POSITIVE ROLE,  SO WHY  CHANGE.  IF THERE HAS BEEN MEAUSRE OF SUCCESS,  ALLIANCE IS WORTH KEEPING. IST IS NOT NECESSARY TO HAVE PUBLIC REDEFINITION OF ALLIANCE,  BUT WE MUST SETLE IN OUR OWN MINDS WHAT NEW DEFINITION WE WANT.  IF  POSSIBLITY OF NUCLEAR WAR NOW REMOTE,  SUBVERSION WILL  GROW,  SO LET US DEAL WITH THAT.  BUT LET US DO IT IN SESSIONS LIKE THIS MINSTERIAL,  NOT RPT NOT PUBLICLY.  WE SHOULD NOT RPT NOT TALK OF CENTO AS  A SINGLE ITEM,  BUT AS PART OF AN ALLANCE SYSTEM.  IF WE ARE HAVING TROUBLE MAINTAINING THE ALLIANCE,  LET S DEAL WITH OUR PROBLEMS AS WUIETLY AND EFFECTIVELY AS  POSSIBLE.  \n3.  AS DEBATE WOUND DOWN,  SECRETARY ROGERS AND BRITISH MINISTER SUGGESTED INCLUSION IN FINAL  COMMUNIQUE OF REAFFIRMATION OF ALLIANCE S CONCERN  FOR INDEPENDENCE AND TERRITORIAL INTEGRITY OF MEMBER  STATES.  PAKISTANIS AND OTHER REGIONALS WERE VERY PLEASED TO AGREE AND APPROPRIATE LANGUAGE WA INCLUDED.  \n4.

CENTO AND OF OTHER ALLIANCES FOR IT IS TRUE OF EUROPE AND                            NATO OF SEATO10 SECRETARY URGED PAKISTAN MINISTER TO KEEP IN MIND THAT PRESIDENTS

POSITIONENSUING GENERAL DISCUSSION REPORTED SEPTEL RUSHSECRET,frus1969-76ve08d59,"1.   SECRETARY ROGERS SAID DISCUSSION IN RESTRICTED SESSION HAD BEEN USEFUL,  INFORMAL AND FRANK,  IN PROPER SPIRIT OF CENTO FORUM.   BEFORE UNDERTAKING REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL SITUATION AS SEEN BY USG,  HE WISHED TO TALK A BIT ABOUT ALLIANCES FROM THE US POINT OF VIEW.      SECRET     2.   BRIEFLY SKETCHING PRE- WORLD WAR II US FOREIGN POLICY,  SECRETARY ROGERS NOTED THAT AMERICAN PUBLIC OPINION AND GOVERNMENT POLICY WAS ISOLATIONIST.   AFTER WAR,  IT WAS REALIZED ISOLATIONISM WAS MISTAKE AND US MUST PLAY MORE ACTIVE ROLE IN WORLD AFFAIRS,  MUST HELP PREVENT WW III.  IT WAS DECIDED BEST WAY WAS CONCEPT OF MUTUAL SECURITY.  ALLIANCES WERE FORMED BASED ON PROPOSITION US MUST BE CON-  CONCERNED,  TAKE AN ACTIVE ROLE ( WITHIN LIMITS OF CONSTITU-  TIONAL POWERS)  IF MAJOR POWER ATTACKED AN ALLY.   THUS CREATION OF NATO,  CENTO,  SEATO.   SUCH ALLIANCES,  INVOLVING ABOUT 43  NATIONS,  WERE SEEN AS BEST WAY TO GUARD AGAINST MAJOR POWER CONFLICTS.   AMERICA HAS BEEN INVOLVED IN TWO WHICH CAUSED DOMESTIC DISSENSION --  BUT THOSE ALLIANCES PREVENTED A MAJOR HOLOCAUST.   \n3.   SECRETARY SAID WE HAVE TAKEN STEPS,  ALONG WITH OTHER NATIONS TO LIMIT THE USE OF NUCLEAR POWER.   HE DID NOT WISH TO BE OVERDRAMATIC,  BUT NUCLEAR EXCHANGE ( OULD VERY NEARLY DESTROY MANKIND.   EVEN SURVIVORS,  MERELY OF FIRST EXCHANGE,  WOULD FIND SELVES IN DESOLATED WORLD.   SO MAJOR US EFFORT HAS GONE INTO EFFORT AVOID ANY CHANCE WORLD MIGHT DESTROY ITSELF.   \n4.   THEREFORE PRESIDENT NIXON EMBARKED ON PROGRAM TO SEEK ARMS GUARANTEES.   USG HAS TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF SPLIT IN COMMUNIST WORLD,  SPLIT WHICH MAY ENDURE FOR YEARS.   WE HAVE SOUGHT MEET WITH USSR AND PRC.   SOVIETS BEGIN UNDER-  LINE NEED END UNDERLINE WEST.   THEY HAVE SERIOUS ECONOMIC PROBLEMS.   THEY HAVE ACUTE SHORTAGES IN AGRICULTURE AND HAVE FALLEN BEHIND IN TECHNOLOGY.   WHERE TEN YEARS AGO WE PREDICTED RUSSIA WOULD CATCH UP WITH WEST,  WE FIND THEM TODAY FALLING BEHIND.   \n5.   PRC IS VERY CONCERNED WITH SOVIET THREAT.   WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO CONVINCE THEM US IS NOT REPEAT NOT A THREAT.  WE HAVE REDUCED US PRESENCE IN ASIA,  OVER HALF A MILLION TROOPS OUT OF VIETNAM, 20,000  OUT OF SOUTH KOREA,  AND OUR REDUCTIONS IN JAPAN.   THIS HAS CONVINCED CHINA TO SEEK BETTER RELATIONS WITH USA.   THESE PRACTICAL FACTS HAVE HELPED MOVE AHEAD OUR RELATIONS,  HAVE REDUCED TENSIONS.      SECRET     6.   AT SAME TIME,  WE DO NOT DELUDE OURSELVES.   THESE NEW RELATIONSHIPS COULD CHANGE ANY DAY.   WE WILL REMAIN ALERT,  VIGILANT.   \n7.   BUT IN THIS WORLD OF INCREASING DETENTE,  THERE WILL STILL BE REGIONAL CONFLICTS.   THIS IS ALMOST INEVITABLE WITH THE MANY PROBLEMS BESETTING DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE WORLD.   WE SEEK TO CONVINCE AMERICAN PEOPLE DETENTE IS GOAL TO BE PURSUED WHILE AT SAME TIME REMAINING STRONG.  YET MANY AMERICANS WANT TO RETURN TO ISOLATION.   THEY WONDER WHY WE SHOULD BOTHER WITH REST OF WORLD.   THERE ARE THOSE WHO URGE US GET OUT OF SEATO,  GET OUT OF CENTO,  BRING OUR TROOPS HOME FROM EUROPE.   IF OUR ALLIANCES ARE NOT WANTED BY OTHERS,  HOW CAN WE PERSUADE AMERICAN PEOPLE?   \n8.   IMPORTANT THING IS THESE POLICIES HAVE WORKED.   NOW IS NOT REPEAT NOT TIME TO BACK AWAY.   NOW IS NOT REPEAT NOT TIME TO INDULGE IN PUBLIC CRITICISM.   THAT IS IN   SOVIET INTEREST.   THAT IS WHAT SOVIETS WANT.   \n9.   CENTO WILL BE INCREASINGLY IMPORTANT IN DAYS AHEAD.  WE MUST WORK TOGETHER,  EXCHANGE VIEWS,  PREPARE OURSELVES THAT EVEN WHILE SOVIETS SEEK DETENTE,  THEY WILL NOT REPEAT NOT ABANDON THEIR IDEOLOGY.   \n0.   SECRETARY THEN TURNED TO REVIEW OF SITUATION IN AREA,  NOTING GULF AREA HAS IMPROVED;  IRAN IS VERY STRONG;  US RELATIONS WITH ARAB WORLD,  DESPITE ARAB- ISRAEL PROBLEM,  HAVE IMPROVED.   HE AGREED WITH TURKISH FOREIGN MINISTER THAT WE MIGHT SEEK TO DO MORE WITH SYRIA,  POSSIBLE EVEN WITH IRAQ.   HE WAS PARTICULARLY PLEASED WITH INCREASED COOPERATION IN GULF,  WHERE WE SOUGHT SEE STATES WORK TO-  GETHER FOR MUTUAL INTERESTS,  WITHOUT INTERFERENCE OF OUT-  SIDE POWERS.   \n1.   IN MIDDLE EAST WE MUST REPEAT MUST HAVE NEGOTIATIONS\n2.   SECRETARY THEN REVERTED TO DISCUSSION OF CENTO ALLIANCE.   HE SAID THAT HE HAD LISTENED WITH INTEREST TO PAK MINISTER,  THAT WE DO UNDERSTAND PAK POSITION.   WE HAVL WORKED CLOSELY WITH PAKISTAN AND WE WILL CONTINUE TO DO SO.   WE BELIEVE STABILITY AND INTEGRITY OF PAKISTAN IS IMPORTANT TO AREA.   BUT THEY MUST UNDERSTAND THAT OUR BILATERAL RELATIONSHIP WITH PAKISTAN HAS BEEN GREATLY STRENGTHENED BY OUR CENTO RELATIONSHIP.   IF THIS WERE TO BE BROKEN,  DISRUPTED,  JEOPARDIZED,  MINIMIZED,  BILATERAL RELATIONS WOULD SUFFER,  ESPECIALLY CONGRESSIONAL ATTITUDES.   \n3.   SECRETARY EXPRESSED HOPE THAT AS RESULT OF CURRENT MINISTERIAL MEETING,  WE COULD DECIDE ORGANIZATION WAS USEFUL TO ALL OF US.   WE DON T NEED TO PUBLICIZE OUR OWN REVIEWS OF CENTO.   SUCH MEETINGS PROVIDE A GOOD FORUM TO DISCUSS PROBLEMS OF THE AREA.   HE STRONGLY STATED HIS BELIEF IT IS IMPORTANT TO PRESERVE THIS KIND OF ALLIANCE. \n4.   AFTER IRANIAN PRESENTATION,  PAKISTANI FOREIGN MINISTER SPOKE IN REPLY TO SECRETARY,  REITERATING PAK POSITION ( OUTLINED EARLIER IN HIS OWN REVIEW OF WORLD SITUATION)  THAT CENTO HAD FAILED SUPPORT PAKISTAN WHEN INDIA,  BACKED BY SOVIETS,  CUT EAST PAKISTAN FROM REST OF COUNTRY.   HE REITERATED POSITION THAT PAKISTAN,  WHILE WIL-  LING BALANCE PROS AND CONS OF CENTO MEMBERSHIP,  COULD NOT REPEAT NOT JUST FORGET BAD EXPERIENCE OVER YEARS WHEN ASSESSING WHETHER COUNTRY SHOULD REMAIN IN CENTO.   \n5.   SECRETARY S FURTHER REPLY AND ENSUING DEBATE FOLLOWS     SECRET      SEPTEL.    RUSH UNQUOTE ROGERS\n",911491

POSITIONENSUING GENERAL DISCUSSION REPORTED SEPTEL RUSHSECRET,frus1969-76ve08d59,"1.  FOLLOWING IS UNCLEARED MEMORANDUM OF CONVERSATION ( PREPARED BY FSO ROBERT CHASE)  AND IS SUBJECT TO  REVISION.  FYI-- AFTER SPEECHES ON OWN GOVERNMENT S VIEW OF WORLD SITUATION,  EACH FOCUSING PRIMARILY  ON CENTO S ROLE IN REGION AND PAKISTAN S FUTURE ROLE IN CENTO,  PAKISTANI MINSTATE AHMED AND SECRETARY  ROGERS EACH SPOKE IN REPLY ( REFTELS).  GENERAL DIS-   CUSSION FOLLOWED.  END FYI\n2.  TURKISH FOREIGN MINISTER BAYULKEN SAID HE WAS HAPPY TO HEAR SUCH SINCERE EXCHANGE.  HE WAS SURE PAK SAGACITY WOULD CONSIDER ALL THINGS.  HE THEN      SECRET      OFFERED A "" POSSIBLY FAR- FETCHED SUGGESTION:""  CENTO  MEMBERS,  ESPECIALLY ONE WHO SUFFERED AS RESULT OF OTHER MATTERS,  WERE INTERESTED IN EXPRESSION OF US CONCERN FOR THEIR SOVEREIGNTY.  COULD WE LEAVE MEETING BELIEVING THAT TERRITORIAL INTEGRITY OF ALL MEMBERS  WAS OF HIGHEST IMPORTANCE,  THAT IF ANY REGIONAL  MEMBER WAS OBJECT OF OPEN AGRESSION,  THIS ORGANIZA-   TION WOULD "" SHOW ITS TEETH""?  \n3.  HE GRANTED THAT INDIVIDUAL MEMBERS WOULD HAVE TO  TAKE CARE OF MANY THINGS BY SELVES.  FOR INSTANCE,   IF ONE DID NOT SHOW SUFFICIENT CONCERN FOR SUBVER-   SION,  ONE MIGHT NOT SEE COVERT AGGRESSION.  BUT,   TURK MINISTER CONCLUDED,  IF WE LEAVE HERE KNOWING WE AREPROTECTED AGAINST NAKED AGGRESSION,  THEN THIS WILL INDEED HAVE BEEN PRODUCTIVE MEETING*  \n4.  BRITISH SECSTATE FCO REMINDED MINISTERS THAT VERY  FEW PEOPLE IN EUROPE IMMEDIATELY POST- WW II,  WHEN  RUSSIHSREVEALED ITS EXPANSION INTENTIONS,   WOULD HAVE BELIEVED DUROPE COULD ESCAPE WITHOUT LOSING TERRITORY.  YET NATO WAS CREATED AND NOT A  YARD OF TERRITORY HAS BEEN LOST,  NOT A SINGLE MAN S LIFE HAS BEEN LOST.  \n5.  IN BRITAIN,  MANY QUESTION WHY BRITAIN SHOULD STAY IN SEATO,  CENTO,  NATO WHEN BRITAIN S OVERSEAS COMMITMENTS WERE SO REDUCED AND HER NATIONAL BUDGET  SO STRAINED.  SUCCESSFUL ANSWER IS THAT BRITAIN HAS  RETURNED UNITS TO SINGAPORE ANBSTILL HAS A MILITARY  PRSENCE IN PERSIAN GULF.  DETERRENT OF WEST PROBABLY  SAVED IRAN,  EVEN PAKISTAN.  DOUGLAS- HOME HARKED BACK  TO EARLIER SECSTATE REMARK AND SAID SUCH RESULT WAS  "" GREATEST THING IN OUR LIVES.""  FROM SUCH EXAMPLE,   WE MUSTN T ELN THINK OF "" DODGING ENTAGLEMENTS"".  \n6.  IN VERY BRIEF REBUTTAL FO PAK EXPRESSION OF COMPLETE DISTRUST OF INDIAN SINCERITY IN DESIRE FOR PEACE,   SIR ALEC NOTED THAT INDIANS ARE "" INDEPENDENT MINDED""   AND IT WAS NOT IN THEIR CHARACTER TO LET THEMSELVES  BECOME CONTROLLED BY SOVIETS.  MRS.  GANDHI HAS GONE     SECRET      ON PUBLIC RECORD THAT SHE SINCERELY DOES WISH TO  SETTLE DIFFERENCES WITH PAKISTAN.  PAKISTAN MUST NEGOTIATE TO PROVE THIS.  \n7.  RETURNING TO CONCEPT OF ALLIANCE,  BRITISH MINISTER  URGED REGIONAL PARTNERS NOT TO UNDERESTIMATE DETERRENT OF WEST S INTERST IN THEIR WELL- BEING.  BUT DIRECT  MILITARY ATTACK SEEMED OUT OF PICTURE,  AND ALLIANCE SHOULD MOVE ON TO CONSIDER HOW TO STRENGTHEN COUNTER-   SUBVERSION.  WEST MUST STILL WORK HARD TO HELP OTHERS DEFEND SELVES THROUGH MUTUAL SECURITY ARRANGE-   MENTS.  \n8.  PAK MINISTER INTERVENED AGAIN TO ASSURE MINISTERS  PAKISTAN DID NOT RPT NOT DENY IMPORTANCE OF ALLIANCES,   BILATERAL OR MULTILATERAL.  BUT HE SAID MANY PEOPLE QUESTION PROMOTION OF PEACE BY MILITARY ALLIANCES.   GOP DOES BELIEVE ALLIANCES HAVE VALUE,  BUT HE CELT PROBLEM IN CENTO WAS NATURE RPT NATURE OF ALLIANCE,   NOT RPT NO PRINCIPLE.  IT CAN BE DETERRENT,  BUT  WAR IS PREVENTED BY MANY CONSIDERATIONS OF WHICH  CENTO MAY HAVE BEEN ONE,  BUT WAS NOT RPT NOT DECISIVE.   ALSO NATO AND CENTO ARE DIFFERENT.  CENTO CANNOT DO IN REGION WHAT NATO DID IN EUROPE.  WAY IN WHICH  CENTO IS STRUCTURED,  IT DID NOTHING RPT NOTHING WHEN  IT WAS NEEDED.  \n9.  MINISTER SAID HE WAS ALREADY CONSCIOUS OF FACTS PREENTED BY US,  GROWING ISOLATIONIST ATTITUDES,   ESPECIALLY IN CONGRESS.  IT WOULD BE MISFORTUNE FOR WORLD,  HE SAID,  IF ISOLATIONISM GOT UPPER HAND.   PAKISTAN WOULD DO NOTHING TO EMBARRASS US.  BUT CENTO AS PRESENTLY STRUCTURED,  AS SHOWN BY PAST  EXPERIENCE,  IS INCAPABLE OF PROTECTING TERRITORY OF MEMBER.  ONE HALF OF PAKISTAN DISAPPEARED AND CENTO  DIDN T EVEN FROWN,  IT WAS UNABLE DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT,  AT LEAST AS CENTO.  HE ADMITTED US WAS  INSTRUMENTAL IN BRINGING QUICK END TO WAR.  \n0.  PAKS WANT TO PUT TEETH IN CENTO.  IT MUST BE      SECRET      RESTRUCTURED,  IT MUST DEFINE ITS OBJECTIVES.   MINISTER WOLD LIKE TO SEE CENTO STRENGTHENED  BY DEFINING NEW KIND OF ALLIANCE,  ALTHOUGH THAT  MIGHT,  OR EVEN WOULD,  HAVE ADVERSE CONSEQUENCES FOR DETENTE.  \n1.  SECRETARY ROGERS SAID IT WAS IMPORTANT FOR PAK  MINISTER TO KEEP IN MIND US POLIT ON AFJIMCES--  ALL ALLIANCES.  NATO IS DIFFERENT FROM CENTO.  MAYBE ITS CONTRIBUTION TO PEACE GREATER.  BUT IF ALLIANCES START TO UNWIND,  MOST UNFORTUNATE SERIES OF EVENTS,   COULD START.  \n2.  POLICY OF ALLIANCES GENERALLY SUCCESSFUL,   SECRETARY SAID.  THEY CANNOT SOLVE ALL PROBLEMS,  HE ADMITTED,  BUT THEY DO PLAY A POSITIVE ROLE,  SO WHY  CHANGE.  IF THERE HAS BEEN MEAUSRE OF SUCCESS,  ALLIANCE IS WORTH KEEPING. IST IS NOT NECESSARY TO HAVE PUBLIC REDEFINITION OF ALLIANCE,  BUT WE MUST SETLE IN OUR OWN MINDS WHAT NEW DEFINITION WE WANT.  IF  POSSIBLITY OF NUCLEAR WAR NOW REMOTE,  SUBVERSION WILL  GROW,  SO LET US DEAL WITH THAT.  BUT LET US DO IT IN SESSIONS LIKE THIS MINSTERIAL,  NOT RPT NOT PUBLICLY.  WE SHOULD NOT RPT NOT TALK OF CENTO AS  A SINGLE ITEM,  BUT AS PART OF AN ALLANCE SYSTEM.  IF WE ARE HAVING TROUBLE MAINTAINING THE ALLIANCE,  LET S DEAL WITH OUR PROBLEMS AS WUIETLY AND EFFECTIVELY AS  POSSIBLE.  \n3.  AS DEBATE WOUND DOWN,  SECRETARY ROGERS AND BRITISH MINISTER SUGGESTED INCLUSION IN FINAL  COMMUNIQUE OF REAFFIRMATION OF ALLIANCE S CONCERN  FOR INDEPENDENCE AND TERRITORIAL INTEGRITY OF MEMBER  STATES.  PAKISTANIS AND OTHER REGIONALS WERE VERY PLEASED TO AGREE AND APPROPRIATE LANGUAGE WA INCLUDED.  \n4.  FY-- TEXT OF FINAL COMMUNIQUE ( TEHRAN 4156)   AND TRANSCRIPT OF SECRETARY ROGERS  DEPARTURE PRESS  CONFERENCE AT AIRPORT ( TEHRAN 4061)  SHOULD BE READ  IN CONJUNCTION WITH THIS AND PREVIOUS REFTELS.

IF PAKISTAN SHOULD LEAVE CENTO IT WOULD HAVE VERY SERIOUS EFFECT                            ON US OPINION IT COULD FEED ISOLATIONISM8 THE SECRETARY CITED NATO IN ICELAND US IS CRITICIZED BECAUSE WE WON                            T ATTACK GREAT BRITAIN THAT IS SILLY NATO WAS NOT CREATED TO SETTLE                            DIFFERENCES BETWEEN ICELAND AND BRITAIN9 ALLIANCE HAS MORE THAN REGIONAL

CENTO AND OF OTHER ALLIANCES FOR IT IS TRUE OF EUROPE AND                            NATO OF SEATO10 SECRETARY URGED PAKISTAN MINISTER TO KEEP IN MIND THAT PRESIDENTS                                NIXON AND BHUTTO WILL CONSIDER THIS MATTER IN                            THEIR FORTHCOMING TALKS BUT HE WANTED ALL MEN GATHERED IN PRESENT                            MEETING TO UNDERSTAND US POSITIONENSUING GENERAL DISCUSSION REPORTED SEPTEL RUSHSECRET,frus1969-76ve08d59,"1.  FOLLOWING IS UNCLEARED MEMORANDUM OF CONVERSATION ( PREPARED BY FSO ROBERT CHASE)  AND IS SUBJECT TO  REVISION.  FYI-- AFTER SPEECHES ON OWN GOVERNMENT S VIEW OF WORLD SITUATION,  EACH FOCUSING PRIMARILY  ON CENTO S ROLE IN REGION AND PAKISTAN S FUTURE ROLE IN CENTO,  PAKISTANI MINSTATE AHMED AND SECRETARY  ROGERS EACH SPOKE IN REPLY ( REFTELS).  GENERAL DIS-   CUSSION FOLLOWED.  END FYI\n2.  TURKISH FOREIGN MINISTER BAYULKEN SAID HE     SECRET      WAS HAPPY TO HEAR SUCH SINCERE EXCHANGE.  HE WAS SURE PAK SAGACITY WOULD CONSIDER ALL THINGS.  HE THEN   OFFERED A "" POSSIBLY FAR- FETCHED SUGGESTION:""  CENTO  MEMBERS,  ESPECIALLY ONE WHO SUFFERED AS RESULT OF OTHER MATTERS,  WERE INTERESTED IN EXPRESSION OF US CONCERN FOR THEIR SOVEREIGNTY.  COULD WE LEAVE MEETING BELIEVING THAT TERRITORIAL INTEGRITY OF ALL MEMBERS\n4.  BRITISH SECSTATE FCO REMINDED MINISTERS THAT VERY  FEW PEOPLE IN EUROPE IMMEDIATELY POST- WW II,  WHEN  RUSSIA REVEALED ITS EXPANSION INTENTIONS,   WOULD HAVE BELIEVED DUROPE COULD ESCAPE WITHOUT LOSING TERRITORY.  YET NATO WAS CREATED AND NOT A  YARD OF TERRITORY HAS BEEN LOST,  NOT A SINGLE MAN S LIFE HAS BEEN LOST.  \n5.  IN BRITAIN,  MANY QUESTION WHY BRITAIN SHOULD STAY IN SEATO,  CENTO,  NATO WHEN BRITAIN S OVERSEAS COMMITMENTS WERE SO REDUCED AND HER NATIONAL BUDGET  SO STRAINED.  SUCCESSFUL ANSWER IS THAT BRITAIN HAS  RETURNED UNITS TO SINGAPORE AND STILL HAS A MILITARY  PRSENCE IN PERSIAN GULF.  DETERRENT OF WEST PROBABLY  SAVED IRAN,  EVEN PAKISTAN.  DOUGLAS- HOME HARKED BACK  TO EARLIER SECSTATE REMARK AND SAID SUCH RESULT WAS  "" GREATEST THING IN OUR LIVES.""  FROM SUCH EXAMPLE,   WE MUSTN T EVEN THINK OF "" DODGING ENTAGLEMENTS"".  \n6.  IN VERY BRIEF REBUTTAL FO PAK EXPRESSION OF COMPLETE DISTRUST OF INDIAN SINCERITY IN DESIRE FOR PEACE,       SECRET      SIR ALEC NOTED THAT INDIANS ARE "" INDEPENDENT MINDED""   AND IT WAS NOT IN THEIR CHARACTER TO LET THEMSELVES  BECOME CONTROLLED BY SOVIETS.  MRS.  GANDHI HAS GONE  ON PUBLIC RECORD THAT SHE SINCERELY DOES WISH TO  SETTLE DIFFERENCES WITH PAKISTAN.  PAKISTAN MUST NEGOTIATE TO PROVE THIS.  \n7.  RETURNING TO CONCEPT OF ALLIANCE,  BRITISH MINISTER  URGED REGIONAL PARTNERS NOT TO UNDERESTIMATE DETERRENT OF WEST S INTERST IN THEIR WELL- BEING.  BUT DIRECT  MILITARY ATTACK SEEMED OUT OF PICTURE,  AND ALLIANCE SHOULD MOVE ON TO CONSIDER HOW TO STRENGTHEN COUNTER-  SUBVERSION.  WEST MUST STILL WORK HARD TO HELP OTHERS DEFEND SELVES THROUGH MUTUAL SECURITY ARRANGE-   MENTS.  \n8.  PAK MINISTER INTERVENED AGAIN TO ASSURE MINISTERS  PAKISTAN DID NOT RPT NOT DENY IMPORTANCE OF ALLIANCES,   BILATERAL OR MULTILATERAL.  BUT HE SAID MANY PEOPLE QUESTION PROMOTION OF PEACE BY MILITARY ALLIANCES.   GOP DOES BELIEVE ALLIANCES HAVE VALUE,  BUT HE  FELT PROBLEM IN CENTO WAS NATURE RPT NATURE OF ALLIANCE,   NOT RPT NOTPRINCIPLE.  IT CAN BE DETERRENT,  BUT   WAR IS PREVENTED BY MANY CONSIDERATIONS OF WHICH  CENTO MAY HAVE BEEN ONE,  BUT WAS NOT RPT NOT DECISIVE.   ALSO NATO AND CENTO ARE DIFFERENT.  CENTO CANNOT DO IN REGION WHAT NATO DID IN EUROPE.  WAY IN WHICH  CENTO IS STRUCTURED,  IT DID NOTHING RPT NOTHING WHEN  IT WAS NEEDED.  \n9.  MINISTER SAID HE WAS ALREADY CONSCIOUS OF FACTS PREENTED BY US,  GROWING ISOLATIONIST ATTITUDES,   ESPECIALLY IN CONGRESS.  IT WOULD BE MISFORTUNE FOR WORLD,  HE SAID,  IF ISOLATIONISM GOT UPPER HAND.   PAKISTAN WOULD DO NOTHING TO EMBARRASS US.  BUT CENTO AS PRESENTLY STRUCTURED,  AS SHOWN BY PAST  EXPERIENCE,  IS INCAPABLE OF PROTECTING TERRITORY OF MEMBER.  ONE HALF OF PAKISTAN DISAPPEARED AND CENTO  DIDN T EVEN FROWN,  IT WAS UNABLE DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT,  AT LEAST AS CENTO.  HE ADMITTED US WAS      SECRET      INSTRUMENTAL IN BRINGING QUICK END TO WAR.  \n0.  PAKS WANT TO PUT TEETH IN CENTO.  IT MUST BE  RESTRUCTURED,  IT MUST DEFINE ITS OBJECTIVES.   MINISTER WOLD LIKE TO SEE CENTO STRENGTHENED  BY DEFINING NEW KIND OF ALLIANCE,  ALTHOUGH THAT  MIGHT,  OR EVEN WOULD,  HAVE ADVERSE CONSEQUENCES FOR DETENTE.  \n1.  SECRETARY ROGERS SAID IT WAS IMPORTANT FOR PAK  MINISTER TO KEEP IN MIND US POLICY ON ALLIANCES--  ALL ALLIANCES.  NATO IS DIFFERENT FROM CENTO.  MAYBE ITS CONTRIBUTION TO PEACE GREATER.  BUT IF ALLIANCES START TO UNWIND,  MOST UNFORTUNATE SERIES OF EVENTS,   COULD START.  \n2.  POLICY OF ALLIANCES GENERALLY SUCCESSFUL,   SECRETARY SAID.  THEY CANNOT SOLVE ALL PROBLEMS,  HE ADMITTED,  BUT THEY DO PLAY A POSITIVE ROLE,  SO WHY  CHANGE.  IF THERE HAS BEEN MEAUSRE OF SUCCESS,  ALLIANCE IS WORTH KEEPING.  IT IS NOT NECESSARY TO HAVE PUBLIC REDEFINITION OF ALLIANCE,  BUT WE MUST SETLE IN OUR OWN MINDS WHAT NEW DEFINITION WE WANT.  IF  POSSIBLITY OF NUCLEAR WAR NOW REMOTE,  SUBVERSION WILL  GROW,  SO LET US DEAL WITH THAT.  BUT LET US DO IT  IN SESSIONS LIKE THIS MINSTERIAL,  NOT RPT NOOR PUBLICLY.  WE SHOULD NOT RPT NOT TALK OF CENTO AS  A SINGLE ITEM,  BUT AS PART OF AN ALLANCE SYSTEM.  IF WE ARE HAVING TROUBLE MAINTAINING THE ALLIANCE,  LETS DEAL WITH OUR PROBLEMS AS QUIETLY AND EFFECTIVELY AS  POSSIBLE.  \n3.  AS DEBATE WOUND DOWN,  SECRETARY ROGERS AND BRITISH MINISTER SUGGESTED INCLUSION IN FINAL  COMMUNIQUE OF REAFFIRMATION OF ALLIANCE S CONCERN  FOR INDEPENDENCE AND TERRITORIAL INTEGRITY OF MEMBER  STATES.  PAKISTANIS AND OTHER REGIONALS WERE VERY PLEASED TO AGREE AND APPROPRIATE LANGUAGE WA INCLUDED.  \n4.  FY-- TEXT OF FINAL COMMUNIQUE ( TEHRAN 4156)   AND TRANSCRIPT OF SECRETARY ROGERS  DEPARTURE PRESS  CONFERENCE AT AIRPORT ( TEHRAN 4061)  SHOULD BE READ  IN CONJUNCTION WITH THIS AND PREVIOUS REFTELS.

THERE  UNCLASSIFIED      IS UNACCUSTOMED UNANIMITY IN THE VIEW THAT THERE IS NO REALISTIC CHANCE OF RALLYING ENOUGH ANTI-  SIHANOUK ELEMENTS TO PUT TOGETHER A FORCE THAT COULD SURVIVE FOR LONG.   HOWEVER,  SOME DIPLOMATS SEE CHANCES OF SHORT- TERM RELIEF FROM FIGHTING IN INSPIRED LEAKS ABOUT MEETINGS BETWEEN EMISSARIES OF LON NOL ANDSIHANOUK,  IN NVN OFFICIALS HAVING MET WITH PEN NOUTH IN PEKING,  AND IN LON NOL HAVING SENT EMISSARY TO PARIS.   SOME DIPLOMATS ARGUE THAT HANOI,  WHOSE ULTIMATE OBJECTIVE IS SAIGON RATHER THAN PP,  MAY BE WILLING TO LIMIT SUPPLIES TO ITS CLIENTS AND TONE DOWN FIGHTING IN CAMBODIA IN EXCHANGE FOR CONCESSIONS  IN SVN.   \n4.   SHARP FIGHTING CONTINUES IN DELTA NEAR CAI LAY AND CAI BE,  AND GVN CLAIMS COMMUNISTS SHELL 8  ARVN POSITIONS IN QUANG NGAI PROVINCE.

SVN S NATIONAL BANK PRESIDENT SUGGESTS AS REASON FOR ACTION THAT DOI WAS IN PROCESS OF BUYING UP WHOLE ECONOMY,  BUT MOST PERSISTENT RUMOR WAS THAT DOI FORESAW TIME WHEN HE WOULD BE LEADER IN VN.

SAYS UNDER C- F AGREEMENTS,  IT BEHOOVES SIGNATORIES,  INCLUDING US,  TO USE ICCS OR RECONVENE PARIS CONFERENCE WHEN VIOLATIONS OCCUR.   USE OF  THAI BASES FOR BOMBING VIOLATES INTERNATIONAL LAW SINCE THAILAND NOT A PARTY EITHER TO C- F AGREEMENTS OR THE PARIS CONFERENCE.   FACT THAT US ARMED FORCES HAVE BEEN ADMITTED BY THAI AUTHORITIES WITHOUT WRITTEN OFFICIAL AGREEMENTS SPECIFYING THE PURPOSES,  DURATION AND OTHER CONDITIONS OF THEIR STAY,  DOES NOT ENTITLE THEM TO COMMIT ACTS OF WAR AGAINST THIRD PARTIES WITH WHICH THAILAND IS NOT IN CONFLICT.   BY SO DOING,  THEY IMPLICATE HOST COUNTRY IN A DE FACTO STATE OF WAR WITHOUT ITS CONSENT OR APPROVAL.  LEGALLY,  THEREFORE,  US FACES RESPONSIBILITY FOR VIOLATIONS OF AGREEMENT AND FOR PERPETRATING ACTS OF WAR FROM A NEUTRAL STATE WITHOUT ITS APPROVAL.   FOR THAILAND,  US FORCES BRING SEQUEL OF SOCIAL ILLS,  MORAL DETERIORATION AND ECON DISTURBANCES;  THEY PLAY NO ROLE IN THAI IN-  SURGENCY PROBLEMS AND DO NOT ENHANCE THAI SECURITY.

HICKMAN,  HEAD FCO SOUTHWEST PACIFIC DEPT.,  HAS REVIEWED WITH US AUSTRALIAN DEFENSE MINISTER BARNARD S DISCUSSIONS HERE JUNE 18-21  WITH BRITISH LEADERS. PRIMARY BRITISH INTEREST IN TALKS WAS FUTURE OF AUSTRALIAN PARTICIPATION IN FPDA,  AND MOST OF THE TIME WAS DEVOTED TO THIS SUBJECT,  WITH OUTCOME "" NEAR BOTTOM OF OUR RANGE OF EXPECTATIONS"".   IN EFFECT,  BARNARD CONFIRMED AUSTRALIAN INTENT TO WITHDRAW FROM FPDA IN\n6.\n2.   BARNARD CONFIRMED SCHEDULE FOR WITHDRAWAL OF AUSTRALIAN GROUND TROOPS AS OUTLINED LONDON 4505, LEAVING CARETAKER GROUP OF 150  BY APRIL 1975.   HE INDICATED THERE COULD BE SOME FLEXIBILITY IN 1976 FINAL WITHDRAWAL DATE OF MIRAGE SQUADRONS AT BUTTER-  CONFIDENTIAL\n7.   ALL AUSTRALIAN MILITARY UNITS WOULD REVERT TO AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL COMMAND IN APRIL 1974.   NO CHANGE IS PLANNED AT PRESENT IN OCCASIONAL DEPLOYMENT OF AUSTRALIAN NAVAL VESSELS TO AREA.\n3.   HICKMAN SAID BARNARD GOT VERY ROUGH PASSAGE FROM LORD CARRINGTON AND SIR ALEC DOUGLAS- HOME,  AND SPENT SOME TIME WITH PRIME MINISTER HEATH WHO DID NOT MINCE WORDS.   HOWEVER IT WAS CLEAR TO BRITISH THAT HE HAD VIRTUALLY NO NEGOTIATING FLEXIBILITY;  HE WAS IN CLOSE TELEPHONIC TOUCH WITH WHITLAM DURING COURSE OF VISIT. BRITISH PRESSED PARTICULARLY HARD ON MIRAGES,  BUT DESPITE FACT THAT MALAYSIANS HAVE MADE IT CLEAR TO GOA THAT THEY DO NOT REGARD POSSIBLE OVERCROWDING AT BUTTERWORTH AS REQUIRING AUSTRALIAN WITHDRAWAL BY ANY SPECIFIC DATE,  HE ARGUED THIS POINT AS JUSTIFI- CATION FOR 1976  WITHDRAWAL.   HE DID SAY THAT AUSTRALIA LACKED ADEQUATE AIRFIELDS AT HOME FOR EFFECTIVE RE- DEPLOYMENT OF MIRAGE SQUADRONS,  AND THERE WAS POSSIBILITY THAT WITHDRAWAL FROM MALAYSIA COULD THERE- FORE BE SLIGHTLY DELAYED.   HE ALSO ARGUED THAT INDONESIA WAS APPREHENSIVE OF FPDA;  BRITISH REBUTTAL OF THIS POINT AND EVIDENCE THAT PRC IS CONTENT WITH FPDA FAILED TO BUDGE HIM.\n4.   AGREED PRESS LINE WILL STATE THAT NO FINAL DECISIONS TAKEN,  THAT VALUABLE DISCUSSIONS WERE HELD CONCERNING AUSTRALIA S FUTURE ROLE IN FPDA,  AND THAT BARNARD S TALKS HERE COMPLETE THE CONSULTATIONS AMONG FPDA\n5.   IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT GOA HAS NOT YET INDICATED ANY INTENTION TO FORMALLY WITHDRAW FROM THE FPDP;  HER FORMAL COMMITMENT TO CONSULT WITH OTHER PARTNERS IN THE EVENT OF EXTERNAL THREAT WILL PRESUMABLY REMAIN IN BEING.   WITHDRAWAL FROM MILITARY PARTICIPATION IN BRITISH VIEW NOT ONLY MAKES THAT COMMITMENT QUITE EMPTY,  IT WILL SERIOUSLY AND IN LONG RUN PERHAPS FATALLY ERODE THE BASIS FOR THE OTHER FOUR MEMBERS TO CONTINUE WITH MEANINGFUL JOINT MILITARY ARRANGEMENTS.\n6.   WHILE FUTURE BRITISH ROLE WILL NOW HAVE TO BE FORMALLY CONSIDERED BY CABINET DEFENSE AND OVERSEAS POLICY COMMITTEE,  HICKMAN SAID HE WAS CONFIDENT THAT HMG WOULD CARRY ON "" AT LEAST AS LONG AS THE AUSTRALIAN MIRAGES REMAIN"".   HE IMPLIED THAT ONCE THEY ARE GONE, THE WHOLE CONCEPT OF AN INTEGRATED DEFENSE WOULD LOSE CREDIBILITY AND BRITISH ROLE WOULD THEN BECOME VERY  CONFIDENTIAL     UNCERTAIN.   BRITISH WILLINGNESS TO CONTINUE FOR NEXT FEW YEARS GREATLY STRENGTHENED BY NEW ZEALAND S STAUNCH ATTITUDE.\n",914793

BLAKENEY MADE CLEAR THAT GOA HAS DECIDED TO WITHDRAW FROM EXERCISE,  OF WHICH AUSTRALIA WAS TO HAVE BEEN DIRECTOR.  HE USED MUCH THE SAME ARGUMENTS THAT AMBASSADOR PLIMSOLL HAD USED IN REFTEL ( I. E.,  CHANGED SITUATION IN SEA, WHITLAM WILL BE VISITING CHINA AT TIME OF EXERCISE,  EXERCISE TOO CLOSE TO TIME OF NEXT SEATO COUNCIL MEETING).  SIMILAR APPROACHES WERE MADE BY AUSTRALIAN MISSIONS IN LONDON,  BANGKOK,  MANILA AND WELLINGTON.\n2.  IN RESPONSE TO QUESTION,  BLAKENEY SAID THAT GOA DECISION WAS NOT RPT NOT TO BE TAKEN AS DECISION NOT TO PARTICIPATE IN ANY FUTURE SEATO EXERCISES.  DFA IS CURRENTLY ENGAGED ( EVIDENTLY AT RATHER LEISURELY PACE)  IN REVIEW OF GOA SEATO POLICY.  IT WILL MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS TO MINISTER FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS ( WHITLAM)  PRIOR TO SEATO COUNCIL MEETING IN NEW YORK SEPT.  28.  WHITLAM WILL MAKE HIS DECISION ON SEATO POLICY IN LIGHT OF DFA RECOMMENDATIONS AND REPORT OF SEATO SECRETARY GENERAL ON REVISED ROLE FOR SEATO, TO BE PRESENTED AT COUNCIL MEETING.  BLAKENEY COMMENTED THAT FUTURE OF NAVAL EXERCISES SHOULD BE FUNCTION OF REVIEW OF SEATO ACTIVITY AS A WHOLE,  RATHER THAN OPERATING ON ITS OWN,  BUILT- IN MOMENTUM.\n3.  DAO HAS LEARNED THAT,  PRIOR TO HIS DEPARTURE FOR LONDON AND STOCKHOLM JUNE 9,  MINISTER FOR DEFENSE BARNARD HAD APPROVED PARTICIPATION IN SEATO EXERCISE.

DEPT CALLED IN REPRESENTATIVES OF EMBASSIES FROM ACTION ADDRESSEE POSTS JUNE 28  FOR BRIEFING ON SOYBEAN AND COTTONSEED EXPORT EMBARGO ANNOUNCED JUNE 27.\n2.   DEPTASSTSECY KATZ OPENED THE MEETING BY REGRETTING THAT IT HAD NOT BEEN POSSIBLE TO MEET EARLIER WITH EMBASSY REPRESENTATIVES TO EXPLAIN THE BACKGROUND OF THE DECISION ANNOUNCED JUNE 27.   IT WAS ONLY AFTER THE RESULTS OF THE DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE SURVEY OF EXPORT CONTRACTS UNDERTAKEN AS A RESULT OF THE PRESIDENT S SPEECH OF JUNE 1 B WERE AVAILABLE THAT IT WAS POSSIBLE TO DETERMINE THE MAGNITUDE OF THE PROBLEM INVOLVED.   WE HAD NOT TAKEN THE ACTION LIGHTLY, WE WERE AWARE THAT IT WAS A DRASTIC MEASURE,  BUT FELT THAT IT WAS MADE NECESSARY BY THE SITUATION WHICH THE COMMERCE SURVEY REVEALED.\n3.   DEPTASST SEC BELL OF USDA NOTED THAT LIVESTOCK PRODUC- TION AROUND THE WORLD HAD INCREASED CONSIDERABLY AND THAT THE COMMODITIES UNDER TEMPORARY EMBARGO WERE USED CHIEFLY IN LIVESTOCK FEED.   HE REITERATED SECRETARY DENT S EARLIER STATEMENT THAT BY MONDAY,  JULY 2,  THERE WOULD BE AN ANNOUNCEMENT ABOUT WHAT QUANTITIES OF SOYBEANS AND COTTON- SEEDS AND THEIR BY- PRODUCTS WOULD BE AVAILABLE FOR EXPORT AND THE METHOD OF ALLOCATION OF THESE QUANTITIES.   THE ACTION HAD BEEN NECESSARY BECAUSE THE SURVEY UNDERTAKEN OF CONTRACTS BY THE DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE INDICATED THAT STRONG DEMAND ABROAD IN THE PERIOD PRECEDING THE HARVESTING OF THE NEW SOYBEAN CROP WAS IMPERILING THE SUPPLY OF PROTEIN FEED AVAILABLE TO DOMESTIC LIVESTOCK AND POULTRY RAISERS.   WE WERE STILL STUDYING THE FIGURES FROM THE COMMERCE SURVEY,  SINCE THERE WAS A POSSIBILITY THAT THEY MIGHT BE INFLATED,  AND THE REVISED FIGURES WOULD DETERMINE WHAT QUANTITIES OF OLDCROP SOYBEANS WOULD BE AVAILABLE FOR EXPORT.   MR.  BELL ALSO CALLED ATTENTION TO SECRETARY DENT S REFERENCE TO THE POSSIBILITY OF ACTION ON CORN  EXPORTS,  BUT NOTED THAT THE CARRYOVER OF CORN AT THE END OF THE CROP YEAR WAS STILL PROJECTED AT A RESPECTABLE  LIMITED OFFICIAL USE\n4.   CHIEF QUESTIONS FROM THE GROUP CONCERNED THE SYSTEM OF EXPORT CONTROLS WHICH WOULD BE ANNOUNCED ON JULY 2, AND THE EFFECT ON CONTRACTS MADE BEFORE THE PRESIDENT S SPEECH OF JUNE 13  ON EXPORT CONTROLS.\n5.   DEPTASSTSECY KATZ NOTED THAT IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO FORECAST AT THIS TIME WHAT THE EVENTUAL ALLOCATION SYSTEM WOULD BE;   THE FACT THAT THE SYSTEM MIGHT BE APPLIED ONLY FOR A LIMITED PERIOD OF TIME,  I. E.,  TWO AND ONE- HALF MONTHS UNTIL THE BEGINNING OF THE NEW CROP YEAR,  MADE THE PROBLEM OF FINDING AN ADEQUATE SYSTEM EVEN MORE DIFFICULT.   HE NOTED THAT IN ANY CASE EXPORTS OF SOYBEANS FROM THE BEGINNING OF THE CROP YEAR IN SEPTEMBER, 1972  THROUGH MAY,  1973 WERE WELL AHEAD OF THE PREVIOUS YEAR S TOTAL, 429  MILLION BUSHELS COMPARED WITH 334  MILLION BUSHELS.   HE ALSO NOTED THAT WHILE WE WOULD ATTEMPT TO SOLVE THE EQUITY PROBLEM REGARDING CONTRACTS AS MUCH AS WAS POSSIBLE,  IT WAS INEVITABLE THAT WHEN THE GOVERNMENT INTERVENED IN THIS MANNER THAT NOT ALL EQUITIES COULD BE SATISFIED. BELL SAID THAT BASED ON THE INFORMATION AVAILABLE ON EXPORT CONTRACTS,  IT HAD NOT BEEN POSSIBLE TO EXCLUDE CONTRACTS WRITTEN PRIOR TO JUNE 13  FROM THE EXPORT CONTROLS.\n6.   BELL ALSO NOTED THAT THE SITUATION WAS NOT ENTIRELY OF OUR OWN MAKING.   HE CITED SHORTAGE OF PERUVIAN FISHMEAL HE ALSO NOTED LARGE FORWARD SALES OF US WHEAT AND CITED\n7.
