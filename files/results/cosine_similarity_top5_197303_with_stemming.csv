4,0.8028021869639611,1726 Subj: Continuing Widespread Student Unrest Ref: Tehran 1353In telegram 1353 from Tehran March 3 the Embassy                            reported that several students were arrested during demonstrations at                            local universities reportedly for protesting Iranian purchases of US                            arms Ibid Central Files 197073 POL 132 IRANSummary: During last three week period student unrest                        and demonstrations sometimes accompanied by violence on part of students                            and police has spread across                        Iran and virtually every major college university or technical training                        school in the country is affected Student motives are difficult to define                        but throughout their protests runs an antiregime theme which often focuses                        on high tuition costs and is sometimes expressed in terms of attacks on                            GOI expenditures particularly for US                        weapons End summary1 Beginnings of current period of student unrestIn a February 28 letter to Escudero Crocker wrote from Khorramshahr that the violence at                            Jondi Shahpur University started when special police killed several                            student demonstrators either for protesting SAVAK surveillance of a Vice Chancellor who refused to give                            an anniversary speech or for opposing the use of university resources                            for White Revolution propaganda Protests at other universities were                            either ongoing or followed quickly Ibid NEAIRN Files: Lot 76D169 Box 9 1973 POL 1 can                        be found as long ago as January 21 celebrations of tenth anniversary of                        White RevolutionIn a February 3 letter to                                Escudero Charles Mast                            Consul in Tabriz wrote that the anniversary festivities were purely for                            the elite marked by an almost total lack of sociopolitical ideology                            Mast concluded that the Imperial Roman Circus was ignored by most                            Iranians particularly the bazaari and religious who were focused on                            the New Years and Moharram celebrations Ibid Carl Clement Consul in Khorramshahr                            disagreed in a February 7 letter to Escudero: the festivities were not entirely                            governmentorganized and the people are not fools and they realized                            that the important thing was not the show not the celebration but                            rather the real changes that they symbolized In a surprising number of                            cases Clement argued people                            sincerely paid homage to the Shahs leadership Ibid Campus                        demonstrations at various universities continued from that time in off                        againon again fashion until about three weeks ago when student dissident                        activities became more widespread and have finally resulted in the closure                        to one degree or another of nearly all of Irans major centers of higher                        education2 Most recent series of demonstrations seem to have begun at Jondi Shapour                        University in Ahwaz but riots have also taken place at Karaj Training                        College Pahlavi University in Shiraz Aryamehr University in Isfahan and                        its related campus in Tehran National University in Tehran where college                        cafeteria was reportedly wrecked Tehran University twice and Tabriz                        University among others3 Upon learning that riot was in progress on Tehran University campus                            EmbOff drove to scene to observe but                        found that three truckloads of riot police wearing plastic face shields and                        carrying hardwood truncheons had put an end to incident Campus was                        practically deserted with most gates locked and campus police bolstered by                        riot police were carefully controlling entry and exit It later developed                        that students registering for new term at science faculty were protesting                        reported arrest on previous day of 30 students at Aryamehr Tehran campus who                        had been demonstrating reputedly to mark anniversary of Siakal incident                        1971 attack by guerilla group on isolated Gendarmrie post in Gilan ProvinceOn February 8 1971 a large band of student dissidents                            known as the Iranian Liberation Organization operating in the                            mountains attacked a police station in the village of Siahkal in the                            northern province of Gilan Government forces subsequently broke up the                            group and several members were executed See Foreign                                    Relations 19691976 volume E4 Documents on Iran and                                Iraq 19691972 Document 126 Dr FNU Zirakhzadeh Director of Research at the                        Ministry of Science and Higher Education later confirmed that additional                        arrests were made at Tehran University although he could not supply                        figures4 Largest and bloodiest encounter to date took place in Tabriz where                        students began demonstration over tuition costs and other local issues                        Police intervened and confrontation escalated into threeday melee with                        reports of over 200 students injured some seriously Figures for students                        killed range from three to eleven but precise number of casualties is                        impossible to confirm Police and SAVAK                        eventually raided all campus dormitories including those of girls drove                        all students from campus and closed the university down for remainder of                        term Tabriz Consulate will report on this incident in detail5 Motivations for present spate of unrest are not entirely clear This is                        due in part to the efficiency of the security forces who tend to break up                        demonstrations before motives and goals are made known in part to the                        tendency of students to disguise dissatisfaction over political issues with                        a local grievance of one kind or another in order to avoid more severe                        punishment if caught and to lack of publicityno word of the various                        disturbances has appeared in the local papersSome riots have evidently been sparked by heavyhanded police action against                        other demonstrators as in the instance noted in para 3 above and in the case                        of a riot which according to Isfahan IAS                        Director Lonnie Del Rae took place at Aryamehr University over a rumor                        apparently false that seven students were arrested at Tehran University by                            SAVAK taken to Kermanshah and shot                        However a definite antiShah theme is discernible throughout the student                        protests Occasionally the monarch himself has been criticized sometimes in                        vitriolic terms and at other times his programs and policies are                        castigated Such discontents are often channeled into criticism of high                        tuitions at Iranian colleges and universities a strategem which according                        to Dr Parviz Asadi of National University is a cover for dissatisfaction                        with expenditures on US arms and other GOI                        fiscal policies as unveiled by Prime Minister Hoveyda in his new ten billion dollar budgetComment: Security authorities have maintained control                        of the student situation but only by closing down Irans system of higher                        education However the widespread and continuing nature of these                        demonstrations is yet another indication of the depth of antiregime feeling                            among the students particularly                        considering that protesting students not only run the risk of physical                        injury in confrontations with police but they could also be expelled jailed                        or drafted into the armed

place within Iraqi regime between                        extremist elements currently in control of party and security organs and                        more constructive realistic elements who want to get on with development                        We should condemn or ignore the first but work to strengthen the latter                            End summary2 Recent messages from USINT A

for example was appalled                        by thought that USINT would even consider                        recommending that USG provide transport for                        basketball team This message gives rationale behind recommendations3 There are two major forces in Iraq today and gap separating them is                        becoming so wide that one can almost speak of two Iraqs Their respective                        policies are sometimes diametrically opposed eg disregard of Western                        opinion on arrested Jews and effort to promote tourism Best known Iraq is                        engaged in subversion smuggling arms supporting Black September at least                        tacitly and other extremist groupsBlack                            September was responsible for both the September 1972 kidnapping and                            murder of 11 Israeli athletes in the Olympic Village in Munich Germany                            and the March 1973

and is vociferous in its                        antiAmerican propaganda This Iraq accurately reflects powerful but small                        group of Baath Party militants and opportunists most in their twenties and                        thirties who dominate security and party organizations They came to power                        through conspiracy and violence lack experience and formal education and                        since they know little about it their perceptions of outside world usually reflect only their Iraqi                        experience Most are true believers in militant opposition to reaction the                        monarchy and imperialism Israel IPC and                        the US and their support for liberation and socialism Baath Iraq There                        is little US can do to either influence them or get rid of them4 The other Iraq equally nationalistic is busy carrying out development                        plans running INOC and the banks                        promoting tourism trying to reverse brain drain and working hard for a                        better life for themselves It includes the technocrats and no doubt                        represents majority of population They do not like arbitrary rule and                        police state methods of Baath regime but are politically powerless There                        are however indications that their ability to influence RCC particularly in economic policy is on                        increase5 In face of Iraqs recent activities arms smuggling to Pakistan attack

       regime Such a policy would be morally confronting comforting but in my view have little chance of bringing about                        change for better On contrary it would probably strengthen extremists                        since it would confirm their view of US as chief enemy6 More realistic way of dealing with dichotomous Iraq and one which carries                        some hope for eventually influencing regime toward more constructive                        policies is to seize every opportunity that may strengthen constructive                        elements We can do this by reestablishing direct official ties where                        possible by encouraging more private links especially in commercial                        sector and by responding

THE OTHER IRAQ,  EQUALLY NATIONALISTIC,  IS BUSY CARRYING OUT DEVELOPMENT PLANS,  RUNNING INOC AND THE BANKS,  PROMOTING TOURISM, TRYING TO REVERSE BRAIN DRAIN,  AND WORKING HARD FOR A BETTER LIFE FOR THEMSELVES.  IT INCLUDES THE TECHNOCRATS AND NO DOUBT  REPRESENTS MAJORITY OF POPULATIONS.  THEY DO NOT LIKE ARBITRARY RULE AND POLICE STATE METHODS OF BAATH REGIME BUT ARE POLITICALLY  POWERLESS.  THERE ARE,  HOWEVER,  INDICATIONS THAT THEIR ABILITY TO INFLUENCE RCC,  PARTICULARLY IN ECONOMIC POLICY IS ON INCREASE.\n5.  IN FACE OF IRAQ S RECENT ACTIVITIES ( ARMS SMUGGLING TO PAKISTAN,  ATTACK ON KUWAIT,  BOYCOTT AGAINST LEBANON,  SUBVERSION IN THE GULF AND YEMEN,  AND AT LEAST TACIT SUPPORT FOR BLACK SEPTEMBER),  U. S.  COULD CONDEMN GOI,  REFUSE ANY REQUESTS FROM WHATEVER SOURCE,  AND PERHAPS EVEN TAKE SOME HOSTILE ACTIONS AGAINST BAATH REGIME.  SUCH A POLICY WOULD BE MORALLY CONFRONTING, BUT IN MY VIEW,  HAVE LITTLE CHANCE OF BRINGING ABOUT CHANGE FOR BETTER.  ON CONTRARY,  IT WOULD PROBABLY STRENGTHEN EXTREMISTS SINCE IT WOULD CONFIRM THEIR VIEW OF U. S.  AS CHIEF ENEMY.\n6.

message gives rationale behind recommendations3 There are two major forces in Iraq today and gap separating them is                        becoming so wide that one can almost speak of two Iraqs Their respective                        policies are sometimes diametrically opposed eg disregard of Western                        opinion on arrested Jews and effort to promote tourism Best known Iraq is                        engaged in subversion smuggling arms supporting Black September at least                        tacitly and other extremist groupsBlack                            September was responsible for both the September 1972 kidnapping and                            murder of 11 Israeli athletes in the Olympic Village in Munich Germany                            and the March 1973

and is vociferous in its                        antiAmerican propaganda This Iraq accurately reflects powerful but small                        group of Baath Party militants and opportunists most in their twenties and                        thirties who dominate security and party organizations They came to power                        through conspiracy and violence lack experience and formal education and                        since they know little about it their perceptions of outside world usually reflect only their Iraqi                        experience Most are true believers in militant opposition to reaction the                        monarchy and imperialism Israel IPC and                        the US and their support for liberation and socialism Baath Iraq There                        is little US can do to either influence them or get rid of them4 The other Iraq equally nationalistic is busy carrying out development                        plans running INOC and the banks                        promoting tourism trying to reverse brain drain and working hard for a                        better life for themselves It includes the technocrats and no doubt                        represents majority of population They do not like arbitrary rule and                        police state methods of Baath regime but are politically powerless There                        are however indications that their ability to influence RCC particularly in economic policy is on                        increase5 In face of Iraqs recent activities arms smuggling to Pakistan attack

       regime Such a policy would be morally confronting comforting but in my view have little chance of bringing about                        change for better On contrary it would probably strengthen extremists                        since it would confirm their view of US as chief enemy6 More realistic way of dealing with dichotomous Iraq and one which carries                        some hope for eventually influencing regime toward more constructive                        policies is to seize every opportunity that may strengthen constructive                        elements We can do this by reestablishing direct official ties where                        possible by encouraging more private links especially in commercial                        sector and by responding

END SUMMARY.\n2.  SOVIET COUNSELLOR TOLD ME SADDAM HUSSEIN S VISIT HAD BEEN  CONFIDENTIAL\n3.  WELL INFORMED DIPLOMATS,  INCLUDING ALGERIA N,  FRENCH AND ITALIANS,  CONTINUE TO BELIEVE THAT SOVIETS WERE VERY DISTURBED WITH IPC SETTLEMENT EVEN THOUGH IN WEEKS PRIOR TO SIGNING THEY HAD TRIED TO SELL THEME THAT RUSSIAN ASSISTANCE HAD MADE FAVORABLE SETTLEMENT POSSIBLE AND THEY NOW ADVISING IRAQIS TO SIGN.

EVEN MORE REVEALING WAS ARTICLE IN SAME ISSUE WHICH,  BY IRAQI STANDARDS,  AMOUNTED TO STRONG ATTACK ON SETTLEMENT ON GROUNDS THAT IRAQ PAYING TOO MUCH COMPENSATION,  IRAQ ACCEPTED PRINCIPLE OF PARTICIPATION,  COMPANIES REMAIN IN STRONG POSITION IN SOUTH,  AND PURCHASE AGREEMENTS WILL BE MADE BY FORMER IPC PARTNERS,  ALL OF WHICH FIT IN WITH DESIGN OF WEST "" TO STOP IRAQ S PROGRESSIVE MARCH AND RUIN IRAQ S RELATIONSHIP WITH SOCIALIST COUNTRIES PARTICULARLY USSR"".\n4.  LESSER REASONS FOR SOVIET APPREHENSION ABOUT IRAQ COULD INCLUDE SMUGGLING OF SOVIET ARMS TO PAKISTAN,  BORDER CLASHES WITH KUWAIT AND IRAN ( IT IS PROBABLY NOT COINCIDENTAL THAT IRANIAN HELICOPTER CREW RETURNED ( BAGHDAD 148)  RIGHT AFTER SADDAM RETURNED),  AND ALACRITY WITH WHICH IRAQ MOVED AFTER IPC SETTLEMENT TOWARD FULL RAPPROACHEMENT WITH EGYPT INCLUDING SEVEN MIL DOLLAR GRANT TO ARMED FORCES.\n5.  OTHER INDICATIONS OF COOLNESS CAN BE SEEN IN JOINT PRESS STATEMENT.  FOR EXAMPLE,  EARLY IN VISIT SADDAM INVITED SOVIET LEADERS TO ATTEND FIRST ANNIVERSARY CELEBRATION OF APR 9  SOVIET- IRAQI TREATY,  BUT PRESS STATEMENT MADE NO MENTION OF ACCEPTANCE. PRESS STATEMENT ALSO MAKES NO MENTION OF ARAB GULF WHICH IS AT TOP OF IRAQ S FOREIGN POLICY LIST.\n6.

IbidLowrie,frus1969-76v27d206,"1.  FOLLOWING ASSESSMENT IS IN RESPONSE TO REFTEL.  DEPARTMENT MAY WISH TO ADD TO OR REVISE IT ON BASIS ADDITIONAL INFORMATION AVAILABLE IN WASHINGTON. \n2.  POLITICAL:  IRAQ,  WITH A POPULATION OF TEN MILLION,  IS GOVERNED BY A REVOLUTIONARY COMMAND COUNCIL CONSISTING OF NINE CIVILIAN AND MILITARY LEADERS.  THE STRONGEST FIGURE IS RCC VICE CHAIRMAN SADDAM HUSSEIN,  LEADER OF THE CIVILIAN WING.  SADDAM HUSSEIN IS THE PERSONIFICATION OF BAATHI IRAQ;  HE IS YOUNG (35),  AMBITIOUS AND RUTHLESS.  HE HAS A LIMITED KNOWLEDGE OF THE OUTSIDE WORLD,  SPEAKS ONLY ARABIC,  AND IS DOGMATIC IN HIS BELIEF THAT THE "" IMPERIALISTS""  LED BY U. S.  ARE ACTIVELY SEEKING TO CRUSH "" REVOLUTIONARY""  IRAQ. \n3.  THE RCC S PRINCIPAL INSTRUMENTS OF POWER ARE THE PERVASIVE AND COMPETING INTELLIGENCE AND INTERNAL SECURITY ORGANS OF THE BAATH PARTY,  THE ARMED FORCES,  AND THE MINISTRY OF THE INTERIOR.  THE NUMBER OF BAATH PARTY MEMBERS IS UNKNOWN,  BUT IS BELIEVED TO BE LESS THAN ONE PERCENT OF THE POPULATION.  ALTHOUGH IN POWER FOR NEARLY FIVE YEARS,  PARTY HAS RETAINED ITS SECRETIVE,  CELL- LIKE STRUCTURE AND INFORMER SYSTEM.  PARTY- MILITARY RIVALRY IS A CONTINUING THREAT AND THE BAATH HAVE ATTEMPTED TO INSURE THE LOYALTY OF THE ARMED FORCED BY GIVING THEM FAVORED TREATMENT,  CARRYING OUT PURGES,  AND ESTABLISHING POLITICAL COMMISSARS.  THE BAATH REGIME HAS ALSO SUCCEEDED IN MOBILIZING MASS SUPPORT,  IF NOT ENTHUSIASM,  THROUGH TIGHTLY CONTROLLED LABOR UNIONS,  PEASANT FEDERATIONS,  AND PARTY  CONFIDENTIAL         OR PARTY FRONT ORGANIZATIONS. \n4.  BAATH ORGANIZATIONAL EFFECTIVENESS HAS GIVEN IRAQ GREATER POL-  ITICAL STABILITY THAN AT ANY TIME SINCE THE PRE-1958  ERA.  THE ONLY KNOWN ORGANIZED OPPOSITION COMES FROM THE KURDS WHO,  UNDER THE LEADERSHIP OF 70  YEAR OLD MUSTAFA BARZANI,  RECEIVE IRANIAN AND ISRAELI ASSISTANCE AND CONTROL A LARGE SLICE OF TERRITORY ON THE NORTHEAST FRONTIER.  A TRUCE OF MARCH 1 970  CONCEDED REGIONAL AUTONOMY TO THE KURDS,  BUT THE GOVERNMENT IS UNWILLING TO GRANT IT IN PRACTICE AND THE KURDS REFUSE TO SETTLE FOR LESS.  BOTH SIDES SEEM RELUCTANT TO RENEW THE FIGHTING AND BARRING NEW OUTSIDE INTERFERENCE,  THE OUTLOOK IS FOR A CONTINUING STALEMATE.  OTHER DISAFFECTED GROUPS ( SHIA MUSLIMS,  CHRISTIANS AND TURCOMANS)  HAVE RARELY MADE COMMON CAUSE WITH THE KURDS OR WITH EACH OTHER AGAINST THE DOMINANT SUNNI MUSLIMS.  ON BALANCE,  THE FUTURE OF THE BAATH REGIME,  PARTICULARLY IN VIEW OF THE ENCOURAGING ECONOMIC PROSPECTS,  SEEMS BRIGHT. \n5.  ECONOMIC:  IRAQ HAS GREAT AGRICULTURAL POTIENTAL,  BUT OIL STILL ACCOUNTS FOR 35  PERCENT OF GNP AND 90  PERCENT OF EXPORT EARNINGS.  THE IPC PACKAGE SETTLEMENT OF MARCH 1, 1973  RESOLVED ALL MAJOR PROBLEMS THAT HAVE TROUBLED RELATIONS BETWEEN IRAQ AND THE   WESTERN OIL COMPANIES FOR TEN YEARS.  IT HAS ASSURED IRAQ OF A RAPID INCREASE IN OIL REVENUES AND GIVEN IT A FLEXIBILITY VIS- A- VIS THE USSR\n5.  FOR THE OIL COMPANIES,  THE SETTLEMENT REPRESENTS PERHAPS THE LAST OPPORTUNITY TO INSURE THEIR PARTICIPATION IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF IRAQ SHUGE RESERVES ( ESTIMATED AT 6  PERCENT OF WORLD RESERVES).  THE ONLY MAJOR WESTERN INVESTMENT LEFT IN IRAQ IS THE BASRA PETROLEUM CO.  IN WHICH MOBIL AND EXXON TOGETHER HAVE 23.75  PERCENT INTEREST.  BPC HAS,  AS PART OF PACKAGE SETTLEMENT,  UNDERTAKEN TO RAISE PRODUCTION IN ITS CONCESSION FROM\n5.  THIS WILL REQUIRE A NEW INVESTMENT OF ABOUT 150  MILLION DOLLARS. \n6.  FAO REPRESENTATIVES GIVE THE BAATH REGIME HIGH MARKS FOR EFFORT AND RESOURCES DEVOTED TO AGRICULTURE AND IRRIGATION ( I. E. \n7.  FOCEIGN POLICY: THE BAATH REGIME HAS WITHIN THE PAST SIX MONTHS SENT ARMS TO OPPOSITION ELEMENTS IN PAKISTAN;  ENGAGED IN SUBVERSIVE ACTIVITIES IN AT LEAST THREE ARAB COUNTRIES;  ATTACKED KUWAITI BORDER POSTS;  CALLED FOR THE ARAB LEAGUE TO TAKE DIRECT ACTION AGAINST U. S.  INTERESTS THROUGHOUT THE MIDDLE EAST;  AND GIVEN FINANCIAL AND POLITICAL SUPPORT THE PALESTINIAN FEDAYEEN,  AND PROBABLY TO BLACK SEPTEMBER.  IN THE EYES OF THE BAATH MILI-  TANTS THESE ACTIVITIES ARE JUSTIFIED IN ORDER TO PROMOTE THE PALESTINIAN CAUSE AND THE DEFEAT OF THE U. S.- LED ALLIANCE OF MIDDLE EAST "" REACTIONARY""  REGIMES WHICH IS TRYING TO DOMINATE THE AREA TO DOQURE THE SUPPLY OF OIL.  THE TWIN PILLARS OF THIS STRATEGY,  IN THE BAATH VIEW,  ARE IRAN AND ISRAEL,  THE TWO COUNTRIES WHO HAVE LONG PROVIDED MILITARY ASSISTANCE TO THE KURDISH DISSIDENTS.  IN ADDITION,  IRAN HAS UNILATERALLY ABROGATED THE SHATT AL- ARAB TREATY OF 1937  AND SIEZED THE GULF ISLANDS WHICH GIVE IT A STRANGLEHOLD ON IRAQ S LIFELINE.  THE ARAB REGIMES OF SAUDI ARABIA AND JORDAN,  IN BAATH EYES,  ARE ACTIVE PARTNERS IN THIS ALLIANCE AND KUWAIT HAS AN AFFINITY FOR IT.  IRAQI SUBVERSIVE ACTIVITIES HAVE,  HOWEVER,  RARELY SUCCEEDED AND HER REPUTATION THROUGHOUT THE AREA IS THAT OF DANGEROUS,  UNPREDICTABLE TROUBLEMAKER. \n8.  A MORE SERIOUS THREAT TO THE AREA MAY EVENTUALLY RESULT FROM THE "" STRATEGIC ALLIANCE""  WHICH IRAQ CLAIMS TO HAVE ESTABLISHED WITH THE USSR BY THE APRIL 1972  FRIENDSHIP TREATY.  IN FACT,  THIS TREATY MADE OFFICIAL WHAT WAS ALREADY A VERY SUBST-  ANTIAL RELATIONSHIP.  THE USSR HAS SINCE 1965  GIVEN ECONOMIC ASSISTANCE OF OVER 500  MILLION DOLLARS AND MILITARY ASSISTANCE OF MORE THAN A BILLION DOLLARS,  MAKING IRAQ THE SECOND LARGEST  CONFIDENTIAL         RECIPIENT ( AFTER EGYPT)  OF SOVIET AID IN THE NEAR EAST.  ALTHOUGH  THE SOVIETS DO NOT SEEM TO BE PRESSING FOR MILITARY FACILITIES,  THEY ARE CONCENTRATING THEIR EFFORTS ON CERTAIN STRATEGIC SECTORS;  THE ARMED FORCES,  OIL,  IRRIGATION,  AND DEVELOPMENT OF MERCHANT AND FISHING FLEETS.  THERE IS CONSIDERABLE EVIDENCE TO SUGGEST THAT THE SOVIETS WERE NOT PLEASED WITH THE NEW LEASE ON LIFE THE IPC SETTLEMENT HAS GIVEN THE WESTERN OIL COMPANIES.  THE BAATH REMAIN WARY OF SOVIET INTENTIONS FOR THEIR MOST FEARED DOMESTIC ENEMY IS THE COMMUNISTS,  WHO AT SOVIET URGING NOW HAVE TWO MINISTERS IN THE GOVERNMENT,  BUT ARE GIVEN NO REAL POWER. \n9.  FRANCE ALONE AMONG WESTERN COUNTRIES HAS SUCCEEDED IN DEVELOPING A CLOSE RELATIONSHIP WITH IRAQ BY VIRTUE OF ITS PRO- ARAB FOREIGN POLICY AND RELIANCE ON IRAQI OIL FOR WHICH IT WILLING TO TAKE INVESTMENT RISKS.  OTHER WESTERN COUNTRIES AND JAPAN ARE SHOWING RENEWED INTEREST IN IRAQI OIL AND THE IRAQI MARKET NOW THAT THE LEGAL IMPEDIMENTS HAVE BEEN REMOVED BY THE IPC SETTLEMENT. \n0.  THE U. S.  INTERESTS SECTION WAS OPENED IN OCTOBER 1972  AND IS STAFFED BY TWO OFFICERS.  THE AMERICAN COMMUNITY OF ABOUT 300  CONSISTS ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY OF AMERICANS MARRIED TO IRAQIS AND THEIR CHILDREN.

place within Iraqi regime between                        extremist elements currently in control of party and security organs and                        more constructive realistic elements who want to get on with development                        We should condemn or ignore the first but work to strengthen the latter                            End summary2 Recent messages from USINT A

for example was appalled                        by thought that USINT would even consider                        recommending that USG provide transport for                        basketball team This message gives rationale behind recommendations3 There are two major forces in Iraq today and gap separating them is                        becoming so wide that one can almost speak of two Iraqs Their respective                        policies are sometimes diametrically opposed eg disregard of Western                        opinion on arrested Jews and effort to promote tourism Best known Iraq is                        engaged in subversion smuggling arms supporting Black September at least                        tacitly and other extremist groupsBlack                            September was responsible for both the September 1972 kidnapping and                            murder of 11 Israeli athletes in the Olympic Village in Munich Germany                            and the March 1973 murder of three diplomats two American and one                            Belgian at the Saudi Embassy in Khartoum Sudan inciting armed                        clashes on Kuwaiti and Iranian borders and is vociferous in its                        antiAmerican propaganda This Iraq accurately reflects powerful but small                        group of Baath Party militants and opportunists most in their twenties and                        thirties who dominate security and party organizations They came to power                        through conspiracy and violence lack experience and formal education and                        since they know little about it their perceptions of outside world usually reflect only their Iraqi                        experience Most are true believers in militant opposition to reaction the                        monarchy and imperialism Israel IPC and                        the US and their support for liberation and socialism Baath Iraq There                        is little US can do to either influence them or get rid of them4 The other Iraq equally nationalistic is busy carrying out development                        plans running INOC and the banks                        promoting tourism trying to reverse brain drain and working hard for a                        better life for themselves It includes the technocrats and no doubt                        represents majority of population They do not like arbitrary rule and                        police state methods of Baath regime but are politically powerless There                        are however indications that their ability to influence RCC particularly in economic policy is on                        increase5 In face of Iraqs recent activities arms smuggling to Pakistan attack

       regime Such a policy would be morally confronting comforting but in my view have little chance of bringing about                        change for better On contrary it would probably strengthen extremists                        since it would confirm their view of US as chief enemy6 More realistic way of dealing with dichotomous Iraq and one which carries                        some hope for eventually influencing regime toward more constructive                        policies is to seize every opportunity that may strengthen constructive                        elements We can do this by reestablishing direct official ties where                        possible by encouraging more private links especially in commercial                        sector and by responding favorably to requests from those elements who wish                        to deal with us At same time there is no reason why we should not condemn                        more irresponsible and extremist acts of regime In short pursue a highly                        flexible policy that attempts to deal with both IraqsThe Department agreed with this view in telegram 60585

activities are justified                        in order to promote the Palestinian cause and the defeat of the USled                        alliance of Middle East reactionary regimes which is trying to dominate                        the area to secure the supply of oil The twin pillars of this strategy in                        the Baath view are Iran and Israel the two countries who have long                        provided military assistance to the Kurdish dissidents In addition Iran                        has unilaterally abrogated the Shatt alArab Treaty of 1937 and seized the                        Gulf islands which give it a stranglehold on Iraqs lifeline The Arab                        regimes of Saudi Arabia and Jordan in Baath eyes are active partners in                        this alliance and Kuwait has an affinity for it Iraqi subversive activities                        have however rarely succeeded and her reputation throughout the area is                        that of dangerous unpredictable troublemaker8 A more serious threat to the area may eventually result from the                        strategic alliance which Iraq claims to have established with the USSR by the April 1972 Friendship Treaty In                        fact this treaty made official what was already a very substantial                        relationship The USSR has since 1965                        given economic assistance of over 500 million dollars and military                        assistance of more than a billion dollars making Iraq the second largest                        recipient after Egypt of Soviet aid in the Near East Although the Soviets                        do not seem to be pressing for military facilities they are concentrating                        their efforts on certain strategic sectors: the armed forces oil                        irrigation and development of merchant and fishing fleets There is                        considerable evidence to suggest that the Soviets were not pleased with the                        new lease on life the IPC settlement has                        given the Western oil companies The Baath remain wary of Soviet intentions                        for their most feared domestic enemy is the Communists who at Soviet urging                        now have two ministers in the government but are given no real power9 France alone among Western countries has succeeded in developing a close                        relationship with Iraq by virtue of its proArab foreign policy and reliance                        on Iraqi oil for which it willing to take investment risks Other Western                        countries and Japan are showing renewed interest in Iraqi oil and the Iraqi                        market now that the legal impediments have been removed by the IPC settlement10 The US Interests Section was opened in October 1972 and is staffed by                        two officers The American community of about 300 consists almost                        exclusively of Americans married to Iraqis and their children Our exports                        here have been running at about 30

FOLLOWING ASSESSMENT IS IN RESPONSE TO REFTEL.  DEPARTMENT MAY WISH TO ADD TO OR REVISE IT ON BASIS ADDITIONAL INFORMATION AVAILABLE IN WASHINGTON. \n2.  POLITICAL:  IRAQ,  WITH A POPULATION OF TEN MILLION,  IS GOVERNED BY A REVOLUTIONARY COMMAND COUNCIL CONSISTING OF NINE CIVILIAN AND MILITARY LEADERS.  THE STRONGEST FIGURE IS RCC VICE CHAIRMAN SADDAM HUSSEIN,  LEADER OF THE CIVILIAN WING.  SADDAM HUSSEIN IS THE PERSONIFICATION OF BAATHI IRAQ;  HE IS YOUNG (35),  AMBITIOUS AND RUTHLESS.  HE HAS A LIMITED KNOWLEDGE OF THE OUTSIDE WORLD,  SPEAKS ONLY ARABIC,  AND IS DOGMATIC IN HIS BELIEF THAT THE "" IMPERIALISTS""  LED BY U. S.  ARE ACTIVELY SEEKING TO CRUSH "" REVOLUTIONARY""  IRAQ. \n3.  THE RCC S PRINCIPAL INSTRUMENTS OF POWER ARE THE PERVASIVE AND COMPETING INTELLIGENCE AND INTERNAL SECURITY ORGANS OF THE BAATH PARTY,  THE ARMED FORCES,  AND THE MINISTRY OF THE INTERIOR.  THE NUMBER OF BAATH PARTY MEMBERS IS UNKNOWN,  BUT IS BELIEVED TO BE LESS THAN ONE PERCENT OF THE POPULATION.  ALTHOUGH IN POWER FOR NEARLY FIVE YEARS,  PARTY HAS RETAINED ITS SECRETIVE,  CELL- LIKE STRUCTURE AND INFORMER SYSTEM.  PARTY- MILITARY RIVALRY IS A CONTINUING THREAT AND THE BAATH HAVE ATTEMPTED TO INSURE THE LOYALTY OF THE ARMED FORCED BY GIVING THEM FAVORED TREATMENT,  CARRYING OUT PURGES,  AND ESTABLISHING POLITICAL COMMISSARS.  THE BAATH REGIME HAS ALSO SUCCEEDED IN MOBILIZING MASS SUPPORT,  IF NOT ENTHUSIASM,  THROUGH TIGHTLY CONTROLLED LABOR UNIONS,  PEASANT FEDERATIONS,  AND PARTY  CONFIDENTIAL         OR PARTY FRONT ORGANIZATIONS. \n4.  BAATH ORGANIZATIONAL EFFECTIVENESS HAS GIVEN IRAQ GREATER POL-  ITICAL STABILITY THAN AT ANY TIME SINCE THE PRE-1958  ERA.  THE ONLY KNOWN ORGANIZED OPPOSITION COMES FROM THE KURDS WHO,  UNDER THE LEADERSHIP OF 70  YEAR OLD MUSTAFA BARZANI,  RECEIVE IRANIAN AND ISRAELI ASSISTANCE AND CONTROL A LARGE SLICE OF TERRITORY ON THE NORTHEAST FRONTIER.  A TRUCE OF MARCH 1 970  CONCEDED REGIONAL AUTONOMY TO THE KURDS,  BUT THE GOVERNMENT IS UNWILLING TO GRANT IT IN PRACTICE AND THE KURDS REFUSE TO SETTLE FOR LESS.  BOTH SIDES SEEM RELUCTANT TO RENEW THE FIGHTING AND BARRING NEW OUTSIDE INTERFERENCE,  THE OUTLOOK IS FOR A CONTINUING STALEMATE.  OTHER DISAFFECTED GROUPS ( SHIA MUSLIMS,  CHRISTIANS AND TURCOMANS)  HAVE RARELY MADE COMMON CAUSE WITH THE KURDS OR WITH EACH OTHER AGAINST THE DOMINANT SUNNI MUSLIMS.  ON BALANCE,  THE FUTURE OF THE BAATH REGIME,  PARTICULARLY IN VIEW OF THE ENCOURAGING ECONOMIC PROSPECTS,  SEEMS BRIGHT. \n5.  ECONOMIC:  IRAQ HAS GREAT AGRICULTURAL POTIENTAL,  BUT OIL STILL ACCOUNTS FOR 35  PERCENT OF GNP AND 90  PERCENT OF EXPORT EARNINGS.  THE IPC PACKAGE SETTLEMENT OF MARCH 1, 1973  RESOLVED ALL MAJOR PROBLEMS THAT HAVE TROUBLED RELATIONS BETWEEN IRAQ AND THE   WESTERN OIL COMPANIES FOR TEN YEARS.  IT HAS ASSURED IRAQ OF A RAPID INCREASE IN OIL REVENUES AND GIVEN IT A FLEXIBILITY VIS- A- VIS THE USSR\n5.  FOR THE OIL COMPANIES,  THE SETTLEMENT REPRESENTS PERHAPS THE LAST OPPORTUNITY TO INSURE THEIR PARTICIPATION IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF IRAQ SHUGE RESERVES ( ESTIMATED AT 6  PERCENT OF WORLD RESERVES).  THE ONLY MAJOR WESTERN INVESTMENT LEFT IN IRAQ IS THE BASRA PETROLEUM CO.  IN WHICH MOBIL AND EXXON TOGETHER HAVE 23.75  PERCENT INTEREST.  BPC HAS,  AS PART OF PACKAGE SETTLEMENT,  UNDERTAKEN TO RAISE PRODUCTION IN ITS CONCESSION FROM\n5.  THIS WILL REQUIRE A NEW INVESTMENT OF ABOUT 150  MILLION DOLLARS. \n6.  FAO REPRESENTATIVES GIVE THE BAATH REGIME HIGH MARKS FOR EFFORT AND RESOURCES DEVOTED TO AGRICULTURE AND IRRIGATION ( I. E. \n7.  FOCEIGN POLICY: THE BAATH REGIME HAS WITHIN THE PAST SIX MONTHS SENT ARMS TO OPPOSITION ELEMENTS IN PAKISTAN;  ENGAGED IN SUBVERSIVE ACTIVITIES IN AT LEAST THREE ARAB COUNTRIES;  ATTACKED KUWAITI BORDER POSTS;  CALLED FOR THE ARAB LEAGUE TO TAKE DIRECT ACTION AGAINST U. S.  INTERESTS THROUGHOUT THE MIDDLE EAST;  AND GIVEN FINANCIAL AND POLITICAL SUPPORT THE PALESTINIAN FEDAYEEN,  AND PROBABLY TO BLACK SEPTEMBER.  IN THE EYES OF THE BAATH MILI-  TANTS THESE ACTIVITIES ARE JUSTIFIED IN ORDER TO PROMOTE THE PALESTINIAN CAUSE AND THE DEFEAT OF THE U. S.- LED ALLIANCE OF MIDDLE EAST "" REACTIONARY""  REGIMES WHICH IS TRYING TO DOMINATE THE AREA TO DOQURE THE SUPPLY OF OIL.  THE TWIN PILLARS OF THIS STRATEGY,  IN THE BAATH VIEW,  ARE IRAN AND ISRAEL,  THE TWO COUNTRIES WHO HAVE LONG PROVIDED MILITARY ASSISTANCE TO THE KURDISH DISSIDENTS.  IN ADDITION,  IRAN HAS UNILATERALLY ABROGATED THE SHATT AL- ARAB TREATY OF 1937  AND SIEZED THE GULF ISLANDS WHICH GIVE IT A STRANGLEHOLD ON IRAQ S LIFELINE.  THE ARAB REGIMES OF SAUDI ARABIA AND JORDAN,  IN BAATH EYES,  ARE ACTIVE PARTNERS IN THIS ALLIANCE AND KUWAIT HAS AN AFFINITY FOR IT.  IRAQI SUBVERSIVE ACTIVITIES HAVE,  HOWEVER,  RARELY SUCCEEDED AND HER REPUTATION THROUGHOUT THE AREA IS THAT OF DANGEROUS,  UNPREDICTABLE TROUBLEMAKER. \n8.  A MORE SERIOUS THREAT TO THE AREA MAY EVENTUALLY RESULT FROM THE "" STRATEGIC ALLIANCE""  WHICH IRAQ CLAIMS TO HAVE ESTABLISHED WITH THE USSR BY THE APRIL 1972  FRIENDSHIP TREATY.  IN FACT,  THIS TREATY MADE OFFICIAL WHAT WAS ALREADY A VERY SUBST-  ANTIAL RELATIONSHIP.  THE USSR HAS SINCE 1965  GIVEN ECONOMIC ASSISTANCE OF OVER 500  MILLION DOLLARS AND MILITARY ASSISTANCE OF MORE THAN A BILLION DOLLARS,  MAKING IRAQ THE SECOND LARGEST  CONFIDENTIAL         RECIPIENT ( AFTER EGYPT)  OF SOVIET AID IN THE NEAR EAST.  ALTHOUGH  THE SOVIETS DO NOT SEEM TO BE PRESSING FOR MILITARY FACILITIES,  THEY ARE CONCENTRATING THEIR EFFORTS ON CERTAIN STRATEGIC SECTORS;  THE ARMED FORCES,  OIL,  IRRIGATION,  AND DEVELOPMENT OF MERCHANT AND FISHING FLEETS.  THERE IS CONSIDERABLE EVIDENCE TO SUGGEST THAT THE SOVIETS WERE NOT PLEASED WITH THE NEW LEASE ON LIFE THE IPC SETTLEMENT HAS GIVEN THE WESTERN OIL COMPANIES.  THE BAATH REMAIN WARY OF SOVIET INTENTIONS FOR THEIR MOST FEARED DOMESTIC ENEMY IS THE COMMUNISTS,  WHO AT SOVIET URGING NOW HAVE TWO MINISTERS IN THE GOVERNMENT,  BUT ARE GIVEN NO REAL POWER. \n9.  FRANCE ALONE AMONG WESTERN COUNTRIES HAS SUCCEEDED IN DEVELOPING A CLOSE RELATIONSHIP WITH IRAQ BY VIRTUE OF ITS PRO- ARAB FOREIGN POLICY AND RELIANCE ON IRAQI OIL FOR WHICH IT WILLING TO TAKE INVESTMENT RISKS.  OTHER WESTERN COUNTRIES AND JAPAN ARE SHOWING RENEWED INTEREST IN IRAQI OIL AND THE IRAQI MARKET NOW THAT THE LEGAL IMPEDIMENTS HAVE BEEN REMOVED BY THE IPC SETTLEMENT. \n0.  THE U. S.  INTERESTS SECTION WAS OPENED IN OCTOBER 1972  AND IS STAFFED BY TWO OFFICERS.  THE AMERICAN COMMUNITY OF ABOUT 300  CONSISTS ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY OF AMERICANS MARRIED TO IRAQIS AND THEIR CHILDREN.

engaged in subversive activities in at                        least three Arab countries attacked Kuwaiti border posts called for the                        Arab League to take direct action against US interests throughout the                        Middle East and given financial and political support to the Palestinian fedayeenAs reported in telegram 112 from Baghdad March 13

activities are justified                        in order to promote the Palestinian cause and the defeat of the USled                        alliance of Middle East reactionary regimes which is trying to dominate                        the area to secure the supply of oil The twin pillars of this strategy in                        the Baath view are Iran and Israel the two countries who have long                        provided military assistance to the Kurdish dissidents In addition Iran                        has unilaterally abrogated the Shatt alArab Treaty of 1937 and seized the                        Gulf islands which give it a stranglehold on Iraqs lifeline The Arab                        regimes of Saudi Arabia and Jordan in Baath eyes are active partners in                        this alliance and Kuwait has an affinity for it Iraqi subversive activities                        have however rarely succeeded and her reputation throughout the area is                        that of dangerous unpredictable troublemaker8 A more serious threat to the area may eventually result from the                        strategic alliance which Iraq claims to have established with the USSR by the April 1972 Friendship Treaty In                        fact this treaty made official what was already a very substantial                        relationship The USSR has since 1965                        given economic assistance of over 500 million dollars and military                        assistance of more than a billion dollars making Iraq the second largest                        recipient after Egypt of Soviet aid in the Near East Although the Soviets                        do not seem to be pressing for military facilities they are concentrating                        their efforts on certain strategic sectors: the armed forces oil                        irrigation and development of merchant and fishing fleets There is                        considerable evidence to suggest that the Soviets were not pleased with the                        new lease on life the IPC settlement has                        given the Western oil companies The Baath remain wary of Soviet intentions                        for their most feared domestic enemy is the Communists who at Soviet urging                        now have two ministers in the government but are given no real power9 France alone among Western countries has succeeded in developing a close                        relationship with Iraq by virtue of its proArab foreign policy and reliance                        on Iraqi oil for which it willing to take investment risks Other Western                        countries and Japan are showing renewed interest in Iraqi oil and the Iraqi                        market now that the legal impediments have been removed by the IPC settlement10 The US Interests Section was opened in October 1972 and is staffed by                        two officers The American community of about 300 consists almost                        exclusively of Americans married to Iraqis and their children Our exports                        here have been running at about 30 million dollars annually but a purchase                        of six Boeing aircraft worth 60 million dollars may soon increase that                        figure While USINT officers have been                        treated correctly the Iraqi                        Government has given no evidence of desiring improved relations with the                        USLowrie,frus1969-76v27d208,"1.  SUMMARY:  USINT RECCOMENDATIONS THAT DEPT APPROVE CERTAIN\n2.  RECENT MESSAGES FROM USINT ( A)  RECOMMENDING FAVORABLE RESPONSE TO IRAQI REQUEST FOR AIR TRANSPORT FOR MILITARY BASKETBALL TEAM; ( B)  PROPOSING THAT USG OFFER A FEW GRADUATE SCHOLARSHIPS; ( C) REQUESTING FILMS FOR MINISTRY OF IRRIGATION;  AND ( D)  PROVIDING U. S. FIRMS WITH SUGGESTIONS FOR DOING MORE BUSINESS HERE,  RAISE QUESTIONS ABOUT OUR POLICY TOWARD IRAQ.  ONE OF MY BRITISH COLLEAGUES FOR EXAMPLE,  WAS APPALLED BY THOUGHT THAT USINT WOULD EVEN CONSIDER RECOMMENDING THAT USG PROVIDE TRANSPORT FOR BASKETBALL TEAM.  THIS MESSAGE GIVES RATIONALE BEHIND RECOMMENDATIONS.\n3.  THERE ARE TWO MAJOR FORCES IN IRAQ TODAY AND GAP SEPARATING THEM IS BECOMING SO WIDE THAT ONE CAN ALMOST SPEAK OF TWO IRAQS.     SECRET\n4.  THE OTHER IRAQ,  EQUALLY NATIONALISTIC,  IS BUSY CARRYING OUT DEVELOPMENT PLANS,  RUNNING INOC AND THE BANKS,  PROMOTING TOURISM, TRYING TO REVERSE BRAIN DRAIN,  AND WORKING HARD FOR A BETTER LIFE FOR THEMSELVES.  IT INCLUDES THE TECHNOCRATS AND NO DOUBT  REPRESENTS MAJORITY OF POPULATIONS.  THEY DO NOT LIKE ARBITRARY RULE AND POLICE STATE METHODS OF BAATH REGIME BUT ARE POLITICALLY  POWERLESS.  THERE ARE,  HOWEVER,  INDICATIONS THAT THEIR ABILITY TO INFLUENCE RCC,  PARTICULARLY IN ECONOMIC POLICY IS ON INCREASE.\n5.  IN FACE OF IRAQ S RECENT ACTIVITIES ( ARMS SMUGGLING TO PAKISTAN,  ATTACK ON KUWAIT,  BOYCOTT AGAINST LEBANON,  SUBVERSION IN THE GULF AND YEMEN,  AND AT LEAST TACIT SUPPORT FOR BLACK SEPTEMBER),  U. S.  COULD CONDEMN GOI,  REFUSE ANY REQUESTS FROM WHATEVER SOURCE,  AND PERHAPS EVEN TAKE SOME HOSTILE ACTIONS AGAINST BAATH REGIME.  SUCH A POLICY WOULD BE MORALLY CONFRONTING, BUT IN MY VIEW,  HAVE LITTLE CHANCE OF BRINGING ABOUT CHANGE FOR BETTER.  ON CONTRARY,  IT WOULD PROBABLY STRENGTHEN EXTREMISTS SINCE IT WOULD CONFIRM THEIR VIEW OF U. S.  AS CHIEF ENEMY.\n6.  MORE REALISTIC WAY OF DEALING WITH DICHOTOMOUS IRAQ,  AND ONE WHICH CARRIES SOME HOPE FOR EVENTUALLY INFLUENCING REGIME TOWARD MORE CONSTRUCTIVE POLICIES,  IS TO SEIZE EVERY OPPORTUNITY THAT MAY     SECRET\n",978914

IPC package settlement                        of March 1 1973 resolved all major problems that have troubled relations                        between Iraq and the Western oil companies for ten years It has assured                        Iraq of a rapid increase in oil revenues and given it a flexibility                        visvis the USSR and the West that it                        has not had before Oil revenue was 900 million dollars in 1971 and is                        expected to rise to two billion dollars in 1975 For the oil companies the                        settlement represents perhaps the last opportunity to ensure their                        participation in the development of Iraqs huge reserves estimated at 6                        percent of world reserves The only

prospects seems bright5 Economic: Iraq has great agricultural potiental but oil still accounts                        for 35 percent of GNP and 90 percent of                        export earnings The IPC package settlement                        of March 1 1973 resolved all major problems that have troubled relations                        between Iraq and the Western oil companies for ten years It has assured                        Iraq of a rapid increase in oil revenues and given it a flexibility                        visvis the USSR and the West that it                        has not had before Oil revenue was 900 million dollars in 1971 and is                        expected to rise to two billion dollars in 1975 For the oil companies the                        settlement represents perhaps the last opportunity to ensure their                        participation in the development of Iraqs huge reserves estimated at 6                        percent of world reserves The only major Western investment left in Iraq                        is the Basra Petroleum Co in which Mobil and Exxon together have 2375                        percent interest BPC has as part of                        package settlement undertaken to raise production in its concession from 34                        MTA in 1972 to 80 MTA in 1975 This will require a new investment of about                        150 million dollars6 FAO representatives give the Baath regime                        high marks for effort and resources devoted to the agriculture and                        irrigation ie 40 percent of the development budget but are not                        complimentary about Baath policies such as moves to collective agriculture                        In fact the regime seems to be still in search of an agricultural policy                        for private holdings exist along side collectives cooperatives and state                        farms In other sectors there are signs of economic pragmatism:                        nationalization of small industrial enterprises has ceased and some have                        been returned to their owners Iraq made some major concessions in achieving                        the IPC settlement there is an effort to                        promote tourism and reverse the brain drain by offering attractive positions                        to expatriates and a growing number of nonBaathist technocrats are found                        in responsible positions However for the time being the regimes radical                        foreign policies are undercutting the efforts of the pragmatists7 Foreign policy: The Baath regime has within the past six months sent arms                        to opposition elements in Pakistan engaged in subversive activities in at                        least three Arab countries attacked Kuwaiti border posts called for the                        Arab League to take direct action against

activities are justified                        in order to promote the Palestinian cause and the defeat of the USled                        alliance of Middle East reactionary regimes which is trying to dominate                        the area to secure the supply of oil The twin pillars of this strategy in                        the Baath view are Iran and Israel the two countries who have long                        provided military assistance to the Kurdish dissidents In addition Iran                        has unilaterally abrogated the Shatt alArab Treaty of 1937 and seized the                        Gulf islands which give it a stranglehold on Iraqs lifeline The Arab                        regimes of Saudi Arabia and Jordan in Baath eyes are active partners in                        this alliance and Kuwait has an affinity for it Iraqi subversive activities                        have however rarely succeeded and her reputation throughout the area is                        that of dangerous unpredictable troublemaker8 A more serious threat to the area may eventually result from the                        strategic alliance which Iraq claims to have established with the USSR by the April 1972 Friendship Treaty In                        fact this treaty made official what was already a very substantial                        relationship The USSR has since 1965                        given economic assistance of over 500 million dollars and military                        assistance of more than a billion dollars making Iraq the second largest                        recipient after Egypt of Soviet aid in the Near East Although the Soviets                        do not seem to be pressing for military facilities they are concentrating                        their efforts on certain strategic sectors: the armed forces oil                        irrigation and development of merchant and fishing fleets There is                        considerable evidence to suggest that the Soviets were not pleased with the                        new lease on life the IPC settlement has                        given the Western oil companies The Baath remain wary of Soviet intentions                        for their most feared domestic enemy is the Communists who at Soviet urging                        now have two ministers in the government but are given no real power9 France alone among Western countries has succeeded in developing a close                        relationship with Iraq by virtue of its proArab foreign policy and reliance                        on Iraqi oil for which it willing to take investment risks Other Western                        countries and Japan are showing renewed interest in Iraqi oil and the Iraqi                        market now that the legal impediments have been removed by the IPC settlement10 The US Interests Section was opened in October 1972 and is staffed by                        two officers The American community of about 300 consists almost                        exclusively of Americans married to Iraqis and their children Our exports                        here have been running at about 30

                 treated correctly the Iraqi                        Government has given no evidence of desiring improved relations with the                        USLowrie,frus1969-76v27d208,"1.

leader of                        the civilian wing Saddam Hussein is                        the personification of Baathi Iraq: he is young 35 ambitious and                        ruthless He has a limited knowledge of the outside world speaks only                        Arabic and is dogmatic in his belief that the imperialists led by US                        are actively seeking to crush revolutionary Iraq3 The RCCs principal instruments of power                        are the pervasive and competing intelligence and internal security organs of                        the Baath Party the armed forces and the Ministry of the Interior The                        number of Baath Party members is unknown but is believed to be less than                        one percent of the

establishing political commissars The Baath regime                        has also succeeded in mobilizing mass support if not enthusiasm through                        tightly controlled labor unions

pass to                            Secretary Shultz Department                            please pass Treasury1 Secretary of the Treasury Shultz called on the Chancellor in his office at the                            Palais Schaumburg on March 15 Also present on the American side were                            Ambassador Hillenbrand and Helmut                                Sonnenfeldt and on the German side State Secretary                            Poehl of the Ministry of Finance and Dr Sanne Assistant Secretary in                            the Chancellery2 After noting that he had had good talks earlier in the day with                            Minister of Finance Schmidt and at                            lunch with Minister of Economics Friderichs Secretary Shultz said that the President felt that our approach to                            solutions of particular problems such as the monetary one must be found                            within the general setting of relations between the countries The                            Chancellor observed that earlier in the day he had made a statement in                            the Bundestag about the monetary situation in which he had emphasized                            the necessity of keeping the Europeans working together and at the same                            time avoiding any increase of difficulties in US relations with the                            Federal Republic and with Europe The Chancellor added that the solution                            which had been found did not constitute a setback in terms of these two                            criteria although it did not on the other hand represent progress                            toward European monetary union It had been essential that the Germans                            keep together with France in their approach otherwise there would have                            been a major deterioration in the situation3 Secretary Shultz said it might                            be of interest to the Chancellor for him to explain our general outlook                            on monetary and trade matters in the light of the unfolding current                            international economic situation The US sees itself involved in a                            system constructed after World War II which worked well It was based on                            the assumption that the US was the completely dominant economy which                            could hold fixed dollar rates and could dispense aid and military                            expenditures abroad on a large scale That system proved to be                            unsuitable for a later period when many Western countries for example                            Germany were also economically powerful Huge deficits in the US balance of payments had occurred                            and had drained our gold reserves The week before August 15 1971 a                            rush on those reserves forced the closing of our gold window bringing                            the end of convertibility After a period of turmoil and searching                            around the Smithsonian Agreement temporarily provided an arrangement                            and the most recent devaluation seemed to have achieved a point from                            which we could look to the future More important than the settlement of                            the moment is the reconstruction of the system Secretary Shultz continued Until this is                            achieved it would be unwise for us to return to the old type of                            intervention in the exchange markets4 In this context it is also necessary to think of the relationship to                            trade and security problems Our objective is to develop an                            international system which relates all of our objectives in these areas                            and a system that will work well without the need for constant                            intervention It was against this background and not solely as a spur of                            the moment decision that we had concluded we could not engage in a                            massive intervention on the exchange markets during the recent                            period5 After thanking Secretary Shultz for this helpful exposition the Chancellor                            observed that the Federal Republic also tried to think in terms of the                            relation between these various matters although there was no single                            place where this relationship could be discussed It was for this reason                            that he had been such a strong proponent of an institutionalized forum                            for dialogue between the US and the European Community Now he felt                            more reluctant on this question particularly after his recent talks                            with British Prime Minister Heath6 In response to the Chancellors query Secretary Shultz said that in the meeting in                            Paris tomorrowSee Document 35 we would put forward our thoughts as                            to the best monetary framework for the time being compatible with a                            longrange solution but he did not expect trade questions to be                            discussed among the Finance Ministers It had been a purpose of his trip                            to obtain reactions to our forthcoming trade legislation the specifics                            of which had been given in some detail to representatives of the                            Ministries of Finance and Economics earlier in the day The Chancellor                            asked whether there would be any surprises Secretary Shultz responded that the spirit of our                            proposals is that of a liberal approach to world trade but if we are to                            get into negotiations we should have the authority to raise or lower                            tariffs as part of these negotiations There would have to be provisions                            for a selective surcharge for balance of payments reasons or to                            safeguard particular industries from injury Some might find this                            concept frightening but we had had some industries wiped out in recent                            years and we should be able to slow up the process so that industries                            could become competitive or until orderly outward movements of workers could take place                            Most countries engaged in such activities7 The Chancellor responded that he understood but that it was wise not                            to go too far in this direction Public reaction could force other                            governments to take counteractions If one looked merely at trade                            figures one came to one sort of conclusion about the US relationship                            with Europe but if one looked at the trade and investment figures                            together another conclusion was possible He would hate to see a trend                            develop which would be unfriendly to US investment As far as trade                            was concerned the Federal Republic was generally close to the US                            position but found it necessary to make some concessions to its                            partners for example to France in the agricultural field This was the                            necessary price for building a European community As one of his people                            had said in the Bundestag there was no sense in hitting the US where                            its economic productivity was strongest namely the agriculture area                            But realistically the Chancellor continued attitudes could not be                            changed immediately since it was necessary to live with France To take                            another example that of reverse preferences he hoped it would be                            possible to get rid of them There was an important political element in                            the European relationship with the Maghreb however and he did not                            believe that preferences for these countries hurt US interests very                            much It was also clear however that these close links could be                            maintained without reverse preferences If he could give any advice it                            would be to accept the positive aspects of these relationships while the                            Community was trying to move ahead in the direction of more freedom of                            trade8 The Chancellor said political difficulties were sometimes also                            experienced in the US and he could understand for example why the                            US Government had been unable to obtain authority from the Congress on                            American selling price despite commitments made during the Kennedy RoundThe Kennedy                                Round of multilateral trade negotiations was held in Geneva from                                1964 to 1967 Sometimes the same kind of problems arose in                            the Community9 Secretary Shultz commented                            that the President will be asking for negotiating authority on                            nontariff barriers We hoped to develop a way of proceeding under which                            the President could agree to mutual reductions then notify Congress of                            this intention and send the proposal forward which after a period of                            say three to six months would come into effect unless vetoed by one                            House of Congress It was sometimes easier for parliaments to do nothing                            than to vote affirmatively10 Referring to the Chancellors remark on investment Secretary                                Shultz noted that there was a                            misunderstood point about the flow of longterm capital There had been                            a period of net flow from the US to Europe but since 1968 there had                            actually been a net flow from Europe to the US This was less conspicuous since it was mostly in                            the form of portfolio investment whereas that of the US to Europe was                            mainly direct investment We need to do more in the US to invite and                            to welcome foreign capital11 The Chancellor commented that it would be helpful if we could get                            some agreed statistics on trade and capital flow He referred to the                            problem the US had been having with Canada in this respect Secretary                                Shultz said we had been                            making much effort in this connection but had not yet reached complete                            agreement with the Canadians State Secretary Poehl said that the                            Germans were trying to perfect their trade figures He agreed with                            Secretary Shultz that there had                            been large flows of capital from Germany particularly in 1969 and in                            the second half of 1972 whereas the inflow had been largely that of                            shortterm capital Secretary Shultz commented that we all had difficulty with                            shortterm capital flows Mr Poehl said there was something wrong when                            the richest country in the world had to import capital Secretary                                Shultz observed that we had a                            net outflow to the world as a whole but not to Europe Poehl asked                            whether it would not be possible to make it more inviting to invest in                            the US as a contribution to the stability of the system He felt that                            such incentives would be better than controls over capital outflow                            Secretary Shultz said we had                            thought of some incentives such as tax changes and better access to                            specific ways of obtaining funds12 The discussion then shifted to the importance of agriculture in the                            US as the most important remaining pressure group generally in favor                            of a liberal trade policy Secretary Shultz noted that the agricultural problem seemed to be                            deeply embedded in politics in most countries The Chancellor commented                            that two years ago his government had been having great troubles with                            the farmers Now the situation was somewhat improved since incomes had                            gone up He really did not know what to do in order to achieve                            agricultural liberalization although he hoped that the British pressures                            would move the Community in this direction but he was personally not                            too optimistic It was more than a problem of statistics It was                            essentially one of political psychology13 The Chancellor asked Secretary Shultz impressions of Brezhnev during his recent visit to Moscow Secretary                                Shultz said he had come                            across as a strong and vigorous person who seemed to want to cooperate                            as much as possible in establishing a good working relationship between                            the US and the Soviet Union The Chancellor said he had been surprised                            to observe the change in Brezhnev                            between his first and second meetings with him On the latter occasion                            he had seemed much more relaxed selfassured and independent of                            prepared briefing materialsHillenbrandRogers,frus1969-76v31d37,"1.   SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY SHULTZ CALLED ON THE  CHANCELLOR IN HIS OFFICE AT THE PALIS SCHAUMBURG ON     SECRET           SECRET    MARCH 15.   ALSO PRESENT ON THE AMERICAN SIDE WERE AMBASSADOR HILLENBRAND AND HELMUT SONNENFELDT,  AND ON THE GERMAN SIDE STATE SECRETARY POEHL,  OF THE MINISTRY OF FINANCE,  AND DR.  SANNE,  ASSISTANT SECRETARY IN THE CHANCELLERY. \n2.   AFTER NOTING THAT HE HAD HAD GOOD TALKS EARLIER IN THE DAY WITH MINISTER OF FIANCE SCHMIDT AND AT LUNCH WITH MINISTER OF ECONOMICS FRIDERICHS,  SECRETARY SHULTZ SAID THAT THE PRESIDENT FELT THAT OUR APPROACH TO SOLU-  TIONS OF PARTICULAR PROBLEMS SUCH AS THE MONETARY ONE MUST BE FOUND WITHIN THE GENERAL SETTING OF RELATIONS BETWEEN THE COUNTRIES.   THE CHANCELLOR OBSERVED THAT EARLIER IN THE DAY HE HAD MADE A STATEMENT IN THE BUNDESTAG ABOUT THE MONETARY SITUATION IN WHICH HE HAD EMPHASIZED THE NECESSITY OF KEEPING THE EUROPEANS WORKING TOGETHER AND AT THE SAME TIME AVOIDING ANY INCREASE OF DIFFICULTIES IN U. S.  RELATIONS WITH THE FEDERAL REPUBLIC AND WITH EUROPE.   THE CHANCELLOR ADDED THAT THE SOLUTION WHICH HAD BEEN FOUND DID NOT CONSTITUTE A SETBACK IN TERMS OF THESE TWO CRITERIA,  ALTHOUGH IT DID NOT ON THE OTHER HAND REPRESENT PROGRESS TOWARD EUROPEAN MONETARY UNION.   IT HAD BEEN ESSENTIAL THAT THE GERMANS KEEP TOGETHER WITH FRANCE IN THEIR APPROACH;  OTHERWISE,  THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN A MAJOR DETERIORATION IN THE SITUATION. \n3.   SECRETARY SHULTZ SAID IT MIGHT BE OF INTEREST TO THE CHANCELLOR FOR HIM TO EXPLAIN OUR GENERAL OUTLOOK ON MONETARY AND TRADE MATTERS IN THE LIGHT OF THE UNFOLDING CURRENT INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC SITUATION.   THERI. S.  SEES ITSELF INVOLVED IN A SYSTEM CONSTRUCTED AFTER WORLD WAR II WHICH WORKED WELL.   IT WAS BASED ON THE ASSUMPTION THAT THE U. S.  WAS THE COMPLETELY DOMINANAT ECONOMY WHICH COULD HOLD FIXED DOLLAR RATESKND COULD DISPENSE AID AND MILITARY EXPENDITURES ABROAD ON A LARGE SCALE.   THAT SYSTEM PROVED TO BE UNSUITABLE FOR A LATER PERIOD WHEN MANY WESTERN COUNTRIES,  FOR EXAMPLE,  GERMANY WERE ALSO ECONOMICALLY POWERFUL.   HUGE DEFICITS IN THE U. S.  BALANCE OF PAYMENTS HAD OCCURRED AND HAD DRAINED OUR GODL RESERVES.   THE WEEK BEFORE AUGUST 15,      SECRET           SECRET    1971,  A RUSH ON THOSE RESERVES FORCED THE CLOSING OF OUR GOLD WINDOW BRINGING THE END OF CONVERTIBILITY.  AFTER A PERIOD OF TURNOIL AND SEARCHING AROUND,  THE SMITHSONIAN AGREEMENT TEMPORARILY PROVIDED AN ARRANGE-  MENT,  AND THE MOST RECENT DEVALUATION SEEMED TO HAVE ACHIEVED A POINT FROM WHICH WE COULD LOOK TO THE FUTURE.  MORE IMPORTANT THAN THE SETTLEMENT OF THE MOMENT IS THE RECONSTRUCTION OF THE SYSTEM,  SECRETARY SHULTZ CONTINUED.  UNTIL THIS IS ACHIEVED IT WOULD BE UNWISE FOR US TO RETURN TO THE OLD TYPE OF INTERVENTION IN THE EXCHANGE MARKETS. \n4.   IN THIS CONTEXT,  IT IS ALSO NECESSARY TO THINK OF THE RELATIONSHIP TO TRADE AND SECURITY PROBLEMS.   OUR OBJECTIVE IS TO DEVELOP AN INTERNATIONAL SYSTEM WHICH RELATES ALL OF OUR OBJECTIVES IN THESE AREAS AND A SYSTEM THAT WILL WORK WELL WITHOUT THE NEED FOR CONSTANT INTERVEN-  TION.   IT WAS AGAINST THIS BACKGROUND AND NOT SOLELY AS A SPUR OF THE MOMENT DECISION THAT WE HAD CONCLUDED WE COULD NOT ENGAGE IN AMASSIVE INTERVENTION ON THE EXCHANGE MARKETS DURING THE RECENT PERIOD. \n5.   AFTER THANKING SECRETARY SHULTZ FOR THIS HELPFUL EXPOSITION,  THE CHANCELLOR OBSERVED  THAT THE FEDERAL REPUBLIC ALSO TRIED TO THINK IN TERMS OF THE RELATION BETWEEN THESE VARIOUS MATTERS,  ALTHOUGH THERE WAS NO SINGLE PLACE WHERE THIS RELATIONSHIP COULD BE DISCUSSED.  IT WAS FOR THIS REASON THAT HE HAD BEEN SUCH A STRONG PROPONENT OF AN INSTITUTIONALIZED FORUM FOR DIALOGUE BETWEEN THE U. S.  AND THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITY.   NOW HE FELT MORE RELUCTANT ON THIS QUESTION,  PARTICULARLY AFTER HIS RECENT TALKS WITH BRITISH PRIME MINISTER HEATH. \n6.   IN RESPONSE TO THE CHANCELLOR S QUERY,  SECRETARY SHULTZ SAID THAT,  IN THE MEETING IN PARIS TOMORROW,  WE WOULD PUT FORWARD OUR THOUGHTS AS TO THE BEST MONETARY FRAMEWORK FOR THE TIME BEING COMPATIBLE WITH A LONG- RANGE SOLUTION,  BUT HE DID NOT EXPECT TRADE QUESTIONS TO BE DISCUSSED AMONG THE FINANCE MINISTERS.   IT HAD BEEN A PURPOSE OF HIS TRIP TO OBTAIN REACTIONS TO OUR FORTHCOMING     SECRET           SECRET    TRADE LEGISLATION,  THE SPECIFICS OF WHICH HAD BEEN GIVEN IN SOME DETAIL TO REPRESENTATIVES OF THE MINISTRIES OF FINANCE AND ECONOMICS EARLIER IN THE DAY.   THE CHANCELLOR ASKED WHETHER THERE WOULD BE ANY SURPRISES.  SECRETARY SHULTZ RESPONDED THAT THE SPIRIT OF OUR PROPOSALS IS THAT OF A LIBERAL APPROACH TO WORLD TRADE,  BUT IF WE ARE TO GET INTO NEGOTIATIONS WE SHOULD HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO RAISE OR LOWER TARIFFS AS PART OF THESE NEGOTIATIONS.  THERE WOULD HAVE TO BE PROVISIONS FOR A SELECTIVE SURCHARGE FOR BALANCE OF PAYMENTS REASONS OR TO SAFEGUARD PARTICULAR INDUSTRIES FROM INJURY.   SOME MIGHT FIND THIS CONCEPT FRIGHTENING,  BUT WE HAD HAD SOME INDUSTRIES WIPED OUT IN RECENT YEARS,  AND WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO SLOW UP THE PROCESS SO THAT INDUSTRIES COULD BECOME COMPETITIVE OR UNTIL ORDERLY OUTWARD MOVEMENTS OF WORKERS COULD TAKE PLACE.   MOST COUNTRIES ENGAGED IN SUCH ACTIVITIES. \n7.  THE CHANCELLOR RESPONDED THAT HE UNDERSTOOD,  BUT THAT IT WAS WISE NOT TO GO TOO FAR IN THIS DIRECTION.  PUBLIC REACTION COULD FORCE OTHER GOVERNMENTS TO TAKE COUNTER- ACTIONS.  IF ONE LOOKED MERELY AT TRADE FIGURES,  ONE CAME TO ONE SORT OF CONCLUSION ABOUT THE U. S.  RELATIONSHIP WITH EUROPE,  BUT IF ONE LOOKED AT THE TRADE AND INVESTMENT FIGURES TOGETHER ANOTHER CONCLUSION WAS POSSIBLE.  HE WOULD HATE TO SEE A TREND DEVELOP WHICH WOULD BE UNFRIENDLY TO U. S.  INVESTMENT.  AS FAR AS TRADE WAS CONCERNED,  THE FEDERAL REPUBLIC WAS GENERALLY CLOSE TO THE U. S.  POSITION BUT FOUND IT NECESSARY TO MAKE SOME CONCESSIONS TO ITS PARTNERS,  FOR EXAMPLE TO FRANCE IN THE AGRICULTURAL FIELD.  THIS WAS THE NECESSARY PRICE FOR BUILDING A EUROPEAN COMMUNITY.  AS ONE OF HIS PEOPLE HAD SAID IN THE BUNDESTAG,  THERE WAS NO SENSE IN HITTING THE U. S.  WHERE ITS ECONOMIC PRODUCTIVITY WAS STRONGEST,  NAMELY THE AGRICULTURE AREA.  BUT REALISTICALLY,  THE CHANCELLOR CONTINUED,  ATTITUDES COULD NOT BE CHANGED IMMEDIATELY,  SINCE IT WAS NECESSARY TO LIVE WITH FRANCE.  TO TAKE ANOTHER EXAMPLE,  THAT OF REVERSE PREFERENCES,  HE HOPED IT WOULD BE POSSIBLE TO GET RID OF THEM.  THERE WAS AN IMPORTANT POLITICAL ELEMENT IN THE EUROPEAN RELATIONSHIP WITH THE MAGHREB,  HOWEVER,  AND HE DID NOT BELIEVE THAT PREFERENCES FOR THESE COUNTRIES HURT U. S.  INTERESTS VERY MUCH.  IT WAS ALSO CLEAR,  HOWEVER,  THAT THESE CLOSE LINKS COULD BE MAIN-  TAINED WITHOUT REVERSE PREFERENCES.  IF HE COULD GIVE ANY ADVICE,  IT WOULD BE TO ACCEPT THE POSITIVE ASPECTS OF THESE RELATIONSHIPS WHILE THE COMMUNITY WAS TRYING TO MOVE AHEAD IN THE DIRECTION     SECRET           SECRET    OF MORE FREEDOM OF TRADE. \n8.  THE CHANCELLOR SAID POLITICAL DIFFICULTIES WERE SOMETIMES ALSO EXPERIENCED IN THE U. S.  AND HE COULD UNDERSTAND,  FOR EXAMPLE,  WHY THE U. S.  GOVERNMENT HAD BEEN UNABLE TO OBTAIN AUTHORITY FROM THE CONGRESS ON AMERICAN SELLING PRICE DESPITE COMMITMENTS MADE DURING THE KENNEDY ROUND.  SOMETIME THE SAME KIND OF PROBLEMS AROSE IN THE COMMUNITY. \n9.  SECRETARY SHULTZ COMMENTED THAT THE PRESIDENT WILL BE ASKING FOR NEGOTIATING AUTHORITY ON NON- TARIFF BARRIERS.  WE HOPED TO DEVELOP A WAY OF PROCEEDING UNDER WHICH THE PRESIDENT COULD AGREE TO MUTUAL REDUCTIONS,  THEN NOTIFY CONGRESS OF THIS INTENTION AND SEND THE PROPOSAL FORWARD WHICH,  AFTER A PERIOD OF SAY THREE TO SIX MONTHS,  WOULD COME INTO EFFECT UNLESS VETOED BY ONE HOUSE OF CONGRESS.  IT WAS SOMETIMES EASIER FOR PARLIAMENTS TO DO NOTHING THAN TO VOTE AFFIRMATIVELY. \n0.  REFERRING TO THE CHANCELLOR S REMARK ON INVESTMENT,  SECRETARY SHULTZ NOTED THAT THERE WAS A MISUNDERSTOOD POINT ABOUT THE FLOW OF LONG- TERM CAPITAL.  THERE HAD BEEN A PERIOD OF NET FLOW FROM THE U. S.  TO EUROPE,  BUT  SINCE 1968  THERE HAD ACTUALLY BEEN A NET FLOW FROM EUROPE TO THE U. S.  THIS WAS LESS CONSPICUOUS SINCE IT WAS MOSTLY IN THE FORM OF PORTFOLIO INVESTMENT,  WHEREAS THAT OF THE U. S.  TO EUROPE WAS MAINLY DIRECT INVESTMENT.  WE NEED TO DO MORE IN THE U. S.  TO INVITE AND TO WELCOME FOREIGN CAPITAL. \n1.  THE CHANCELLOR COMMENTED THAT IT WOULD BE HELPFUL IF WE COULD GET SOME AGREED STATISTICS ON TRADE AND CAPITAL FLOW.  HE REFERRED TO THE PROBLEM THE U. S.  HAD BEEN HAVING WITH CANADA IN THIS RESPECT.  SECRETARY SHULTZ SAID WE HAD BEEN MAKING MUCH EFFORT IN THIS CONNECTION BUT HAD NOT YET REACHED COMPLETE AGREEMENT WITH THE CANADIANS.  STATE SECRETARY POEHL SAID THAT THE GERMANS WERE TRYING TO PERFECT THEIR TRADE FIGURES.  HE AGREED WITH SECRETARY SHULTZ THAT THERE HAD BEEN LARGE FLOWS OF CAPITAL FROM GERMANY,  PARTICULARLY IN 1969  AND IN THE SECOND HALF OF 1972,  WHEREAS THE INFLOW HAD BEEN LARGELY THAT OF SHORT- TERM CAPITAL.  SECRETARY SHULTZ COMMENTED THAT WE ALL HAD DIFFICULTY WITH SHORT-      SECRET           SECRET    TERM CAPITAL FLOWS.  MR.  POEHL SAID THERE WAS SOMETHING WRONG WHEN THE RICHEST COUNTRY IN THE WORLD HAD TO IMPORT CAPITAL.  SECRETARY SHULTZ OBSERVED THAT WE HAD A NET OUTFLOW TO THE WORLD AS A WHOLE BUT NOT TO EUROPE.  POEHL ASKED WHETHER IT WOULD NOT BE POSSIBLE TO MAKE IT MORE INVITING TO INVEST IN THE U. S.  AS A CONTRIBUTION TO THE STABILITY OF THE SYSTEM.  HE FELT THAT SUCH INCENTIVES WOULD BE BETTER THAN CONTROLS OVER CAPITAL OUTFLOW.  SECRETARY SHULTZ SAID WE HAD THOUGHT OF SOME INCENTIVES SUCH AS TAX CHANGES AND BETTER ACCESS TO SPECIFIC WAYS OF OBTAINING FUNDS. \n2.  THE DISCUSSION THAN SHIFTED TO THE IMPORTANCE OF AGRICULTURE IN THE U. S.  AS THE MOST IMPORTANT REMAINING PRESSURE GROUP GENERALLY IN FAVOR OF A LIBERAL TRADE POLICY.  SECRETARY SHULTZ NOTED THAT THE AGRICULTURAL PROBLEM SEEMED TO BE DEEPLY EMBEDDED IN POLITICS IN MOST COUNTRIES.  THE CHANCELLOR COMMENTED THAT TWO  YEARS AGO HIS GOVERNMENT HAD BEEN HAVING GREAT TROUBLES WITH THE FARMERS.  NOW THE SITUATION WAS SOMEWHAT IMPROVED SINCE INCOMES HAD GONE UP.  HE REALLY DID NOT KNOW WHAT TO DO IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE AGRICULTURAL LIBERALIZATION ALTHOUGH HE HOPED THAT THE BRITISH PRESSURES WOULD MOVE THE COMMUNITY IN THIS DIRECTION,  BUT HE WAS PERSONALLY NOT TOO OPTIMISTIC.  IT WAS MORE THAN A PROBLEM OF STATISTICS.  IT WAS ESSENTIALLY ONE OF POLITICAL PSYCHOLOGY. \n3.  THE CHANCELLOR ASKED SECRETARY SHULTZ  IMPRESSIONS OF  BREZHNEV DURING HIS RECENT VISIT TO MOSCOW.  SECRETARY SHULTZ SAID HE HAD COME ACROSS AS A STRONG AND VIGOROUS PERSON WHO SEEMED TO WANT TO COOPERATE AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE IN ESTABLISHING  A GOOD WORKING RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE U. S.  AND THE SOVIET UNION.  THE CHANCELLOR SAID HE HAD BEEN SURPRISED TO OBSERVE THE CHANGE IN BREZHNEV BETWEEN HIS FIRST AND SECOND MEETINGS WITH HIM.  ON THE LATTER OCCASION HE HAD SEEMED MUCH MORE RELAXED,  SELF- ASSURED AND INDEPENDENT OF PREPARED BRIEFING MATERIALS.  HILLENBRAND UNQUOTE ROGERS\n",976305

pass to                            Secretary Shultz Department                            please pass Treasury1 Secretary of the Treasury Shultz called on the Chancellor in his office at the                            Palais Schaumburg on March 15 Also present on the American side were                            Ambassador Hillenbrand and Helmut                                Sonnenfeldt and on the German side State Secretary                            Poehl of the Ministry of Finance and Dr Sanne Assistant Secretary in                            the Chancellery2 After noting that he had had good talks earlier in the day with                            Minister of Finance Schmidt and at                            lunch with Minister of Economics Friderichs Secretary Shultz said that the President felt that our approach to                            solutions of particular problems such as the monetary one must be found                            within the general setting of relations between the countries The                            Chancellor observed that earlier in the day he had made a statement in                            the Bundestag about the monetary situation in which he had emphasized                            the necessity of keeping the Europeans working together and at the same                            time avoiding any increase of difficulties in US relations with the                            Federal Republic and with Europe The Chancellor added that the solution                            which had been found did not constitute a setback in terms of these two                            criteria although it did not on the other hand represent progress                            toward European monetary union It had been essential that the Germans                            keep together with France in their approach otherwise there would have                            been a major deterioration in the situation3 Secretary Shultz said it might                            be of interest to the Chancellor for him to explain our general outlook                            on monetary and trade matters in the light of the unfolding current                            international economic situation The US sees itself involved in a                            system constructed after World War II which worked well It was based on                            the assumption that the US was the completely dominant economy which                            could hold fixed dollar rates and could dispense aid and military                            expenditures abroad on a large scale That system proved to be                            unsuitable for a later period when many Western countries for example                            Germany were also economically powerful Huge deficits in the US balance of payments had occurred                            and had drained our gold reserves The week before August 15 1971 a                            rush on those reserves forced the closing of our gold window bringing                            the end of convertibility After a period of turmoil and searching                            around the Smithsonian Agreement temporarily provided an arrangement                            and the most recent devaluation seemed to have achieved a point from                            which we could look to the future More important than the settlement of                            the moment is the reconstruction of the system Secretary Shultz continued Until this is                            achieved it would be unwise for us to return to the old type of                            intervention in the exchange markets4 In this context it is also necessary to think of the relationship to                            trade and security problems Our objective is to develop an                            international system which relates all of our objectives in these areas                            and a system that will work well without the need for constant                            intervention It was against this background and not solely as a spur of                            the moment decision that we had concluded we could not engage in a                            massive intervention on the exchange markets during the recent                            period5 After thanking Secretary Shultz for this helpful exposition the Chancellor                            observed that the Federal Republic also tried to think in terms of the                            relation between these various matters although there was no single                            place where this relationship could be discussed It was for this reason                            that he had been such a strong proponent of an institutionalized forum                            for dialogue between the US and the European Community Now he felt                            more reluctant on this question particularly after his recent talks                            with British Prime Minister Heath6 In response to the Chancellors query Secretary Shultz said that in the meeting in                            Paris tomorrowSee Document 35 we would put forward our thoughts as                            to the best monetary framework for the time being compatible with a                            longrange solution but he did not expect trade questions to be                            discussed among the Finance Ministers It had been a purpose of his trip                            to obtain reactions to our forthcoming trade legislation the specifics                            of which had been given in some detail to representatives of the                            Ministries of Finance and Economics earlier in the day The Chancellor                            asked whether there would be any surprises Secretary Shultz responded that the spirit of our                            proposals is that of a liberal approach to world trade but if we are to                            get into negotiations we should have the authority to raise or lower                            tariffs as part of these negotiations There would have to be provisions                            for a selective surcharge for balance of payments reasons or to                            safeguard particular industries from injury Some might find this                            concept frightening but we had had some industries wiped out in recent                            years and we should be able to slow up the process so that industries                            could become competitive or until orderly outward movements of workers could take place                            Most countries engaged in such activities7 The Chancellor responded that he understood but that it was wise not                            to go too far in this direction Public reaction could force other                            governments to take counteractions If one looked merely at trade                            figures one came to one sort of conclusion about the US relationship                            with Europe but if one looked at the trade and investment figures                            together another conclusion was possible He would hate to see a trend                            develop which would be unfriendly to US investment As far as trade                            was concerned the Federal Republic was generally close to the US                            position but found it necessary to make some concessions to its                            partners for example to France in the agricultural field This was the                            necessary price for building a European community As one of his people                            had said in the Bundestag there was no sense in hitting the US where                            its economic productivity was strongest namely the agriculture area                            But realistically the Chancellor continued attitudes could not be                            changed immediately since it was necessary to live with France To take                            another example that of reverse preferences he hoped it would be                            possible to get rid of them There was an important political element in                            the European relationship with the Maghreb however and he did not                            believe that preferences for these countries hurt US interests very                            much It was also clear however that these close links could be                            maintained without reverse preferences If he could give any advice it                            would be to accept the positive aspects of these relationships while the                            Community was trying to move ahead in the direction of more freedom of                            trade8 The Chancellor said political difficulties were sometimes also                            experienced in the US and he could understand for example why the                            US Government had been unable to obtain authority from the Congress on                            American selling price despite commitments made during the Kennedy RoundThe Kennedy                                Round of multilateral trade negotiations was held in Geneva from                                1964 to 1967 Sometimes the same kind of problems arose in                            the Community9 Secretary Shultz commented                            that the President will be asking for negotiating authority on                            nontariff barriers We hoped to develop a way of proceeding under which                            the President could agree to mutual reductions then notify Congress of                            this intention and send the proposal forward which after a period of                            say three to six months would come into effect unless vetoed by one                            House of Congress It was sometimes easier for parliaments to do nothing                            than to vote affirmatively10 Referring to the Chancellors remark on investment Secretary                                Shultz noted that there was a                            misunderstood point about the flow of longterm capital There had been                            a period of net flow from the US to Europe but since 1968 there had                            actually been a net flow from Europe to the US This was less conspicuous since it was mostly in                            the form of portfolio investment whereas that of the US to Europe was                            mainly direct investment We need to do more in the US to invite and                            to welcome foreign capital11 The Chancellor commented that it would be helpful if we could get                            some agreed statistics on trade and capital flow He referred to the                            problem the US had been having with Canada in this respect Secretary                                Shultz said we had been                            making much effort in this connection but had not yet reached complete                            agreement with the Canadians State Secretary Poehl said that the                            Germans were trying to perfect their trade figures He agreed with                            Secretary Shultz that there had                            been large flows of capital from Germany particularly in 1969 and in                            the second half of 1972 whereas the inflow had been largely that of                            shortterm capital Secretary Shultz commented that we all had difficulty with                            shortterm capital flows Mr Poehl said there was something wrong when                            the richest country in the world had to import capital Secretary                                Shultz observed that we had a                            net outflow to the world as a whole but not to Europe Poehl asked                            whether it would not be possible to make it more inviting to invest in                            the US as a contribution to the stability of the system He felt that                            such incentives would be better than controls over capital outflow                            Secretary Shultz said we had                            thought of some incentives such as tax changes and better access to                            specific ways of obtaining funds12 The discussion then shifted to the importance of agriculture in the                            US as the most important remaining pressure group generally in favor                            of a liberal trade policy Secretary Shultz noted that the agricultural problem seemed to be                            deeply embedded in politics in most countries The Chancellor commented                            that two years ago his government had been having great troubles with                            the farmers Now the situation was somewhat improved since incomes had                            gone up He really did not know what to do in order to achieve                            agricultural liberalization although he hoped that the British pressures                            would move the Community in this direction but he was personally not                            too optimistic It was more than a problem of statistics It was                            essentially one of political psychology13 The Chancellor asked Secretary Shultz impressions of Brezhnev during his recent visit to Moscow Secretary                                Shultz said he had come                            across as a strong and vigorous person who seemed to want to cooperate                            as much as possible in establishing a good working relationship between                            the US and the Soviet Union The Chancellor said he had been surprised                            to observe the change in Brezhnev                            between his first and second meetings with him On the latter occasion                            he had seemed much more relaxed selfassured and independent of                            prepared briefing materialsHillenbrandRogers,frus1969-76v31d37,"1.

                 Palais Schaumburg on March 15 Also present on the American side were                            Ambassador Hillenbrand and Helmut                                Sonnenfeldt and on the German side State Secretary                            Poehl of the Ministry of Finance and Dr Sanne Assistant Secretary in                            the Chancellery2 After noting that he had had good talks earlier in the day with                            Minister of Finance Schmidt and at                            lunch with Minister of Economics Friderichs Secretary Shultz said that the President felt that our approach to                            solutions of particular problems such as the monetary one must be found                            within the general setting of relations between the countries The                            Chancellor observed that earlier in the day he had made a statement in                            the Bundestag about the monetary situation in which he had emphasized                            the necessity of keeping the Europeans working together and at the same                            time avoiding any increase of difficulties in US relations with the                            Federal Republic and with Europe The Chancellor added that the solution                            which had been found did not constitute a setback in terms of these two                            criteria although it did not on the other hand represent progress                            toward European monetary union It had been essential that the Germans                            keep together with France in their approach otherwise there would have                            been a major deterioration in the situation3 Secretary Shultz said it might                            be of interest to the Chancellor for him to explain our general outlook                            on monetary and trade matters in the light of the unfolding current                            international economic situation The US sees itself involved in a                            system constructed after World War II which worked well It was based on                            the assumption that the US was the completely dominant economy which                            could hold fixed dollar rates and could dispense aid and military                            expenditures abroad on a large scale That system proved to be                            unsuitable for a later period when many Western countries for example                            Germany were also economically powerful Huge deficits in the US balance of payments had occurred                            and had drained our gold reserves The week before August 15 1971 a                            rush on those reserves forced the closing of our gold window bringing                            the end of convertibility After a period of turmoil and searching                            around the Smithsonian Agreement temporarily provided an arrangement                            and the most recent devaluation seemed to have achieved a point from                            which we could look to the future More important than the settlement of                            the moment is the reconstruction of the system Secretary Shultz continued Until this is                            achieved it would be unwise for us to return to the old type of                            intervention in the exchange markets4 In this context it is also necessary to think of the relationship to                            trade and security problems Our objective is to develop an                            international system which relates all of our objectives in these areas                            and a system that will work well without the need for constant                            intervention It was against this background and not solely as a spur of                            the moment decision that we had concluded we could not engage in a                            massive intervention on the exchange markets during the recent                            period5 After thanking Secretary Shultz for this helpful exposition the Chancellor                            observed that the Federal Republic also tried to think in terms of the                            relation between these various matters although there was no single                            place where this relationship could be discussed It was for this reason                            that he had been such a strong proponent of an institutionalized forum                            for dialogue between the US and the European Community Now he felt                            more reluctant on this question particularly after his recent talks                            with British Prime Minister Heath6 In response to the Chancellors query Secretary Shultz said that in the meeting in                            Paris tomorrowSee Document 35 we would put forward our thoughts as                            to the best monetary framework for the time being compatible with a                            longrange solution but he did not expect trade questions to be                            discussed among the Finance Ministers It had been a purpose of his trip                            to obtain reactions to our forthcoming trade legislation the specifics                            of which had been given in some detail to representatives of the                            Ministries of Finance and Economics earlier in the day The Chancellor                            asked whether there would be any surprises Secretary Shultz responded that the spirit of our                            proposals is that of a liberal approach to world trade but if we are to                            get into negotiations we should have the authority to raise or lower                            tariffs as part of these negotiations There would have to be provisions                            for a selective surcharge for balance of payments reasons or to                            safeguard particular industries from injury Some might find this                            concept frightening but we had had some industries wiped out in recent                            years and we should be able to slow up the process so that industries                            could become competitive or until orderly outward movements of workers could take place                            Most countries engaged in such activities7 The Chancellor responded that he understood but that it was wise not                            to go too far in this direction Public reaction could force other                            governments to take counteractions If one looked merely at trade                            figures one came to one sort of conclusion about the US relationship                            with Europe but if one looked at the trade and investment figures                            together another conclusion was possible He would hate to see a trend                            develop which would be unfriendly to US investment As far as trade                            was concerned the Federal Republic was generally close to the US                            position but found it necessary to make some concessions to its                            partners for example to France in the agricultural field This was the                            necessary price for building a European community As one of his people                            had said in the Bundestag there was no sense in hitting the US where                            its economic productivity was strongest namely the agriculture area                            But realistically the Chancellor continued attitudes could not be                            changed immediately since it was necessary to live with France To take                            another example that of reverse preferences he hoped it would be                            possible to get rid of them There was an important political element in                            the European relationship with the Maghreb however and he did not                            believe that preferences for these countries hurt US interests very                            much It was also clear however that these close links could be                            maintained without reverse preferences If he could give any advice it                            would be to accept the positive aspects of these relationships while the                            Community was trying to move ahead in the direction of more freedom of                            trade8 The Chancellor said political difficulties were sometimes also                            experienced in the US and he could understand for example why the                            US Government had been unable to obtain authority from the Congress on                            American selling price despite commitments made during the Kennedy RoundThe Kennedy                                Round of multilateral trade negotiations was held in Geneva from                                1964 to 1967 Sometimes the same kind of problems arose in                            the Community9 Secretary Shultz commented                            that the President will be asking for negotiating authority on                            nontariff barriers We hoped to develop a way of proceeding under which                            the President could agree to mutual reductions then notify Congress of                            this intention and send the proposal forward which after a period of                            say three to six months would come into effect unless vetoed by one                            House of Congress It was sometimes easier for parliaments to do nothing                            than to vote affirmatively10 Referring to the Chancellors remark on investment Secretary                                Shultz noted that there was a                            misunderstood point about the flow of longterm capital There had been                            a period of net flow from the US to Europe but since 1968 there had                            actually been a net flow from Europe to the US This was less conspicuous since it was mostly in                            the form of portfolio investment whereas that of the US to Europe was                            mainly direct investment We need to do more in the US to invite and                            to welcome foreign capital11 The Chancellor commented that it would be helpful if we could get                            some agreed statistics on trade and capital flow He referred to the                            problem the US had been having with Canada in this respect Secretary                                Shultz said we had been                            making much effort in this connection but had not yet reached complete                            agreement with the Canadians State Secretary Poehl said that the                            Germans were trying to perfect their trade figures He agreed with                            Secretary Shultz that there had                            been large flows of capital from Germany particularly in 1969 and in                            the second half of 1972 whereas the inflow had been largely that of                            shortterm capital Secretary Shultz commented that we all had difficulty with                            shortterm capital flows Mr Poehl said there was something wrong when                            the richest country in the world had to import capital Secretary                                Shultz observed that we had a                            net outflow to the world as a whole but not to Europe Poehl asked                            whether it would not be possible to make it more inviting to invest in                            the US as a contribution to the stability of the system He felt that                            such incentives would be better than controls over capital outflow                            Secretary Shultz said we had                            thought of some incentives such as tax changes and better access to                            specific ways of obtaining funds12 The discussion then shifted to the importance of agriculture in the                            US as the most important remaining pressure group generally in favor                            of a liberal trade policy Secretary Shultz noted that the agricultural problem seemed to be                            deeply embedded in politics in most countries The Chancellor commented                            that two years ago his government had been having great troubles with                            the farmers Now the situation was somewhat improved since incomes had                            gone up He really did not know what to do in order to achieve                            agricultural liberalization although he hoped that the British pressures                            would move the Community in this direction but he was personally not                            too optimistic It was more than a problem of statistics It was                            essentially one of political psychology13 The Chancellor asked Secretary Shultz impressions of Brezhnev during his recent visit to Moscow Secretary                                Shultz said he had come                            across as a strong and vigorous person who seemed to want to cooperate                            as much as possible in establishing a good working relationship between                            the US and the Soviet Union The Chancellor said he had been surprised                            to observe the change in Brezhnev                            between his first and second meetings with him On the latter occasion                            he had seemed much more relaxed selfassured and independent of                            prepared briefing materialsHillenbrandRogers,frus1969-76v31d37,1.

turmoil and searching                            around the Smithsonian Agreement temporarily provided an arrangement                            and the most recent devaluation seemed to have achieved a point from                            which we could look to the future More important than the settlement of                            the moment is the reconstruction of the system Secretary Shultz continued Until this is                            achieved it would be unwise for us to return to the old type of                            intervention in the exchange markets4 In this context it is also necessary to think of the relationship to                            trade and security problems Our objective is to develop an                            international system which relates all of our objectives in these areas                            and a system that will work well without the need for constant                            intervention It was against this background and not solely as a spur of                            the moment decision that we had concluded we could not engage in a                            massive intervention on the exchange markets during the recent                            period5 After thanking Secretary Shultz for this helpful exposition the Chancellor                            observed that the Federal Republic also tried to think in terms of the                            relation between these various matters although there was no single                            place where this relationship could be discussed It was for this reason                            that he had been such a strong proponent of an institutionalized forum                            for dialogue between the US and the European Community Now he felt                            more reluctant on this question particularly after his recent talks                            with British Prime Minister Heath6 In response to the Chancellors query Secretary Shultz said that in the meeting in                            Paris tomorrowSee Document 35 we would put forward our thoughts as                            to the best monetary framework for the time being compatible with a                            longrange solution but he did not expect trade questions to be                            discussed among the Finance Ministers It had been a purpose of his trip                            to obtain reactions to our forthcoming trade legislation the specifics                            of which had been given in some detail to representatives of the                            Ministries of Finance and Economics earlier in the day The Chancellor                            asked whether there would be any surprises Secretary Shultz responded that the spirit of our                            proposals is that of a liberal approach to world trade but if we are to                            get into negotiations we should have the authority to raise or lower                            tariffs as part of these negotiations There would have to be provisions                            for a selective surcharge for balance of payments reasons or to                            safeguard particular industries from injury Some might find this                            concept frightening but we had had some industries wiped out in recent                            years and we should be able to slow up the process so that industries                            could become competitive or until orderly outward movements of workers could take place                            Most countries engaged in such activities7 The Chancellor responded that he understood but that it was wise not                            to go too far in this direction Public reaction could force other                            governments to take counteractions If one looked merely at trade                            figures one came to one sort of conclusion about the US relationship                            with Europe but if one looked at the trade and investment figures                            together another conclusion was possible He would hate to see a trend                            develop which would be unfriendly to US investment As far as trade                            was concerned the Federal Republic was generally close to the US                            position but found it necessary to make some concessions to its                            partners for example to France in the agricultural field This was the                            necessary price for building a European community As one of his people                            had said in the Bundestag there was no sense in hitting the US where                            its economic productivity was strongest namely the agriculture area                            But realistically the Chancellor continued attitudes could not be                            changed immediately since it was necessary to live with France To take                            another example that of reverse preferences he hoped it would be                            possible to get rid of them There was an important political element in                            the European relationship with the Maghreb however and he did not                            believe that preferences for these countries hurt US interests very                            much It was also clear however that these close links could be                            maintained without reverse preferences If he could give any advice it                            would be to accept the positive aspects of these relationships while the                            Community was trying to move ahead in the direction of more freedom of                            trade8 The Chancellor said political difficulties were sometimes also                            experienced in the US and he could understand for example why the                            US Government had been unable to obtain authority from the Congress on                            American selling price despite commitments made during the Kennedy RoundThe Kennedy                                Round of multilateral trade negotiations was held in Geneva from                                1964 to 1967 Sometimes the same kind of problems arose in                            the Community9 Secretary Shultz commented                            that the President will be asking for negotiating authority on                            nontariff barriers We hoped to develop a way of proceeding under which                            the President could agree to mutual reductions then notify Congress of                            this intention and send the proposal forward which after a period of                            say three to six months would come into effect unless vetoed by one                            House of Congress It was sometimes easier for parliaments to do nothing                            than to vote affirmatively10 Referring to the Chancellors remark on investment Secretary                                Shultz noted that there was a                            misunderstood point about the flow of longterm capital There had been                            a period of net flow from the US to Europe but since 1968 there had                            actually been a net flow from Europe to the US This was less conspicuous since it was mostly in                            the form of portfolio investment whereas that of the US to Europe was                            mainly direct investment We need to do more in the US to invite and                            to welcome foreign capital11 The Chancellor commented that it would be helpful if we could get                            some agreed statistics on trade and capital flow He referred to the                            problem the US had been having with Canada in this respect Secretary                                Shultz said we had been                            making much effort in this connection but had not yet reached complete                            agreement with the Canadians State Secretary Poehl said that the                            Germans were trying to perfect their trade figures He agreed with                            Secretary Shultz that there had                            been large flows of capital from Germany particularly in 1969 and in                            the second half of 1972 whereas the inflow had been largely that of                            shortterm capital Secretary Shultz commented that we all had difficulty with                            shortterm capital flows Mr Poehl said there was something wrong when                            the richest country in the world had to import capital Secretary                                Shultz observed that we had a                            net outflow to the world as a whole but not to Europe Poehl asked                            whether it would not be possible to make it more inviting to invest in                            the US as a contribution to the stability of the system He felt that                            such incentives would be better than controls over capital outflow                            Secretary Shultz said we had                            thought of some incentives such as tax changes and better access to                            specific ways of obtaining funds12 The discussion then shifted to the importance of agriculture in the                            US as the most important remaining pressure group generally in favor                            of a liberal trade policy Secretary Shultz noted that the agricultural problem seemed to be                            deeply embedded in politics in most countries The Chancellor commented                            that two years ago his government had been having great troubles with                            the farmers Now the situation was somewhat improved since incomes had                            gone up He really did not know what to do in order to achieve                            agricultural liberalization although he hoped that the British pressures                            would move the Community in this direction but he was personally not                            too optimistic It was more than a problem of statistics It was                            essentially one of political psychology13 The Chancellor asked Secretary Shultz impressions of Brezhnev during his recent visit to Moscow Secretary                                Shultz said he had come                            across as a strong and vigorous person who seemed to want to cooperate                            as much as possible in establishing a good working relationship between                            the US and the Soviet Union The Chancellor said he had been surprised                            to observe the change in Brezhnev                            between his first and second meetings with him On the latter occasion                            he had seemed much more relaxed

                 Palais Schaumburg on March 15 Also present on the American side were                            Ambassador Hillenbrand and Helmut                                Sonnenfeldt and on the German side State Secretary                            Poehl of the Ministry of Finance and Dr Sanne Assistant Secretary in                            the Chancellery2 After noting that he had had good talks earlier in the day with                            Minister of Finance Schmidt and at                            lunch with Minister of Economics Friderichs Secretary Shultz said that the President felt that our approach to                            solutions of particular problems such as the monetary one must be found                            within the general setting of relations between the countries The                            Chancellor observed that earlier in the day he had made a statement in                            the Bundestag about the monetary situation in which he had emphasized                            the necessity of keeping the Europeans working together and at the same                            time avoiding any increase of difficulties in US relations with the                            Federal Republic and with Europe The Chancellor added that the solution                            which had been found did not constitute a setback in terms of these two                            criteria although it did not on the other hand represent progress                            toward European monetary union It had been essential that the Germans                            keep together with France in their approach otherwise there would have                            been a major deterioration in the situation3 Secretary Shultz said it might                            be of interest to the Chancellor for him to explain our general outlook                            on monetary and trade matters in the light of the unfolding current                            international economic situation The US sees itself involved in a                            system constructed after World War II which worked well It was based on                            the assumption that the US was the completely dominant economy which                            could hold fixed dollar rates and could dispense aid and military                            expenditures abroad on a large scale That system proved to be                            unsuitable for a later period when many Western countries for example                            Germany were also economically powerful Huge deficits in the US balance of payments had occurred                            and had drained our gold reserves The week before August 15 1971 a                            rush on those reserves forced the closing of our gold window bringing                            the end of convertibility After a period of turmoil and searching                            around the Smithsonian Agreement temporarily provided an arrangement                            and the most recent devaluation seemed to have achieved a point from                            which we could look to the future More important than the settlement of                            the moment is the reconstruction of the system Secretary Shultz continued Until this is                            achieved it would be unwise for us to return to the old type of                            intervention in the exchange markets4 In this context it is also necessary to think of the relationship to                            trade and security problems Our objective is to develop an                            international system which

best monetary framework for the time being compatible with a                            longrange solution but he did not expect trade questions to be                            discussed among the Finance Ministers It had been a purpose of his trip                            to obtain reactions to our forthcoming trade legislation the specifics                            of which had been given

selective surcharge for balance of payments reasons or to                            safeguard particular industries from injury Some might find this                            concept frightening but we had had some industries wiped out in recent                            years and we should be able to slow up the process so that industries                            could become competitive or

                         to go too far in this direction Public reaction could force other                            governments to take counteractions If one looked merely at trade                            figures one came to one sort of conclusion about the US relationship                            with Europe but if one looked at the trade and investment figures                            together another conclusion was possible He would hate to see a trend                            develop which would be unfriendly to US investment As far as trade                            was concerned the Federal Republic was generally close to the US                            position but found it necessary to make some concessions to its                            partners for example to France in the agricultural field This was the                            necessary price for building a European community As one of his people                            had said in the Bundestag there was no sense in hitting the US where                            its economic productivity was strongest namely the agriculture area                            But realistically the Chancellor continued attitudes could not be                            changed immediately since it was necessary to live with France To take                            another example that of reverse preferences he hoped it would be                            possible to get rid of them There was an important political element in                            the European relationship with the Maghreb however and he did not                            believe that preferences for these countries hurt US interests very                            much It was also clear however that these close links could be                            maintained without reverse preferences If he could give any advice it                            would be to accept the positive aspects of these relationships while the                            Community was trying to move ahead in the direction of more freedom of                            trade8 The Chancellor said political difficulties were sometimes also                            experienced in the US and he could understand for example why the                            US Government had been unable to obtain authority from the Congress on                            American selling price despite commitments made during the Kennedy RoundThe Kennedy                                Round of multilateral trade negotiations was held in Geneva from                                1964 to 1967 Sometimes the same kind of problems arose in                            the Community9 Secretary Shultz commented                            that the President will be asking for negotiating authority on                            nontariff barriers We hoped to develop a way of proceeding under which                            the President could agree to mutual reductions then notify Congress of                            this intention and send the proposal forward which after a period of                            say three to six months would come into effect unless vetoed by one                            House of Congress It was sometimes easier for parliaments to do nothing                            than to vote affirmatively10 Referring to the Chancellors remark on investment Secretary                                Shultz noted that there was a                            misunderstood point about the flow of longterm capital There had been                            a period of net flow from the US to Europe but since 1968 there had                            actually been a net flow from Europe to the US This was less conspicuous since it was mostly in                            the form of portfolio investment whereas that of the US to Europe was                            mainly direct investment We need to do more in the US to invite and                            to welcome foreign capital11 The Chancellor commented that it would be helpful if we could get                            some agreed statistics on trade and capital flow He referred to the                            problem the US had been having with Canada in this respect Secretary                                Shultz said we had been                            making much effort in this connection but had not yet reached complete                            agreement with the Canadians State Secretary Poehl said that the                            Germans were trying to perfect their trade figures He agreed with                            Secretary Shultz that there had                            been large flows of capital from Germany particularly in 1969 and in                            the second half of 1972 whereas the inflow had been largely that of                            shortterm capital Secretary Shultz commented that we all had difficulty with                            shortterm capital flows Mr Poehl said there was something wrong when                            the richest country in the world had to import capital Secretary                                Shultz observed that we had a                            net outflow to the world as a whole but not to Europe Poehl asked                            whether it would not be possible to make it more inviting to invest in                            the US as a contribution to the stability of the system He felt that                            such incentives would be better than controls over capital outflow                            Secretary Shultz said we had                            thought of some incentives such as tax changes and better access to                            specific ways of obtaining funds12 The discussion then shifted to the importance of agriculture in the                            US as the most important remaining pressure group generally in favor                            of a liberal trade policy Secretary Shultz noted that the agricultural problem seemed to be                            deeply embedded in politics in most countries The Chancellor commented                            that two years ago his government had been having great troubles with                            the farmers Now the situation was somewhat improved since incomes had                            gone up He really did not know what to do in order to achieve                            agricultural liberalization although he hoped that the British pressures                            would move the Community in this direction but he was personally not                            too optimistic It was more than a problem of statistics It was                            essentially one of political psychology13 The Chancellor asked Secretary Shultz impressions of Brezhnev during his recent visit to Moscow Secretary                                Shultz said he had come                            across as a strong and vigorous person who seemed to want to cooperate                            as much as possible in establishing a good working relationship between                            the US and the Soviet Union The Chancellor said he had been surprised                            to observe the change in Brezhnev                            between his first and second meetings with him On the latter occasion                            he had seemed much more relaxed selfassured and independent of                            prepared briefing materialsHillenbrandRogers,frus1969-76v31d37,"1.

MINISTER AHMED REVIEWED IN DETAIL EVOLUTION OF SIMLA PROCESS,  FOCUSING PARTICULARLY ON 3 1/2  MONTH DELAY IN WORKING OUT KASHMIR LINE OF CONTROL AND TROOP WITHDRAWALS.  SAID DELAY WAS END RESULT OF "" EXERCISE IN INDIAN SEMANTICS"".  DELAY HAD UNFORTUNATE IMPACT ON SIMLA PROCESS;  PAK PEOPLE WERE SOMEWHAT DISENCHANTED AND THERE HAD BEEN A LOT OF HARM TO EXPECTATIONS ON BOTH SIDES. \n3.   AFTER TROOP WITHDRAWAL COMPLETE,  THERE HAD BEEN EXCHANGE OF LETTERS BETWEEN BHUTTO AND MRS.  GANDHI FOLLOWED BY YET ANOTHER LETTER FROM BHUTTO IN WHICH HE HAD PROPOSED THAT THEY PROCEED IN ONE OF TWO WAYS:  EITHER AGREE MUTUALLY TO POW REPATRIATION IMMEDIATELY,  WHICH WOULD EASE RECOGNITION PROBLEM AND MAKE TREMENDOUS IMPACT ON PAK PEOPLE,  OR IF NOT PREPARED TO DO THIS,  THEN BHUTTO PREPARED HAVE SUMMIT MEETING.  MRS.  GANDHI HAD NOT REPLIED TO THAT LETTER AND HAD MADE IT PUBLICLY KNOWN THAT THERE WAS NO PURPOSE IN SUMMIT UNTIL RECOG-  NITION.   RESULT WAS CURRENT DEADLOCK AND PEACE WAS IN "" COLD STORAGE"".   \n4.   IN RESPONSE SECRETARY S QUERY WHETHER THIS COULD CHANGE,  AHMED REFERRED TO UNSYG S VISIT AND MODEST EXPECTATIONS THIS HAD PRODUCED.   BHUTTO HAD TOLD SYG THERE MUST BE PACKAGE DEAL INCLUDING AGREEMENT THAT THERE BE NO WAR CRIMES TRIALS,  THAT BIHAREES BE ASSURED OF CHANCE TO LIVE IN PEACE IN BANGLADESH AND THAT THERE BE AGREEMENT IN PRINCIPLE ON DIVISION OF ASSETS AND LIABILI-  TIES IN BANGLADESH BEFORE THERE COULD BE RECOGNITION.

BHUTTO HAD SAID HE AMENABLE TO THIS AND HAD AUTHORIZED SYG TO PASS THIS ALONG TO MUJIB.   APPARENTLY MUJIB S RESPONSE TO SYG WAS DISAPPOINTING;  HOWEVER,  AHMED SAID HE HOPED GET FURTHER DETAILS WHEN HE SAW SYG IN NEW YORK DURING CURRENT TRIP.   AHMED CONCLUDED THAT THOUGH OUTLOOK UNCERTAIN GOP THOUGHT SOME MOVEMENT MIGHT BE MADE,  BY EITHER INDIA OR BANGLADESH OR BOTH,  LATER THIS MONTH.  MEANWHILE,  GOP COULD DO NOTHING EXCEPT PERHAPS TO HOPE THAT US AND OTHERS WOULD USE WHATEVER INFLUENCE THEY HAD.   \n6.   AT SECRETARY S REQUEST AHMED DESCRIBED SOME OF THE PROBLEMS THAT RECOGNITION CREATED FOR GOP,  EMPHASIZING THROUGHOUT THAT GOP FELT PAKISTAN MUST ACCEPT REALITY AND GET ON WITH RECOGNITION AS SOON AS POSSIBLE AND PROVIDED THERE COOPERATION FROM MUJIB ALONG LINES HE HAD INDICATED.   HOWEVER,  BHUTTO HAD TO DEAL WITH STRONG OPPOSITION SENTIMENT WHICH WOULD SEE RECOGNITION AS PUTTING SEAL OF APPROVAL ON INDIA S USE OF FORCE TO DISMEMBER PAKISTAN IN 1971.   KHAR INTERJECTED SUPPORTING COMMENT AT THIS POINT TO EFFECT THAT PAK PEOPLE STILL   BITTER ABOUT EVENTS 1971  AND THAT THIS PARTICULARLY THE CASE IN PUNJAB.   \n7.   SECRETARY QUERIED WHETHER TOO MUCH SIGNIFICANCE MAY NOT HAVE BECOME ASSOCIATED WITH SIMPLE ACT OF RECOGNITION IN THIS CASE,  NOTING US EXPERIENCE IN SEVERAL CASES WHERE SIMPLE STATEMENT OF RECOGNITION HAD NO PRACTICAL FOLLOW ON.   MOREOVER,  THERE WERE OTHER CASES WHERE WE HAD NOT EXTENDED RECOGNITION AND YET MAINTAINED CONSIDERABLE RELATIONSHIP.   DURING LENGTHY EXCHANGE MINISTER AHMED S POSITION BOILED DOWN TO ASSERTION THAT BECAUSE OF EXPERIENCE THEY HAD HAD WITH MUJIB TO DATE,  THEY COULD NOT PLACE TRUST AND CONFIDENCE IN WHAT MUJIB MIGHT DO OR NOT DO ONCE BHUTTO EXTENDED RECOGNITION.   PAKISTAN THEREFORE NEEDED SOME CONCRETE ASSURANCE THAT AT LEAST WITH RESPECT TO POWS THERE WOULD BE RESPONSE BY MUJIB THAT WOULD PERMIT PROCESS OF RECONCILIATION TO GET UNDERWAY.   SECRETARY  CONFIDENTIAL         ASKED IF HIS ASSUMPTION WAS THEREFORE CORRECT THAT GOP WOULD BE PREPARED TO INDICATE AGREEMENT IN PRINCIPLE,                  QUIETLY TRANSMITTED IN SOME WAY TO BDG,  THAT FORMAL RECOGNITION WOULD BE IMPLEMENTED WHEN AGREEMENT ON POWS REACHED.   AHMED RESPONDED AFFIRMATIVELY.  NONETHELESS BOTH AHMED AND KHAR STRESSED DIFFICULTIES BHUTTO FACED DEALING WITH MUJIB,  PARTICULARLY RISK HE FACED THAT MUJIB MIGHT BACK OUT OF ASSURANCES ON POWS AFTER BHUTTO HAD EXTENDED SOME KIND OF ASSURANCE ON RECOGNITION.   AHMED NOTED ALSO FACT THAT INDIANS BEING UNHELPFUL,  CITING ONE INDIAN STATEMENT TO EFFECT THAT RECOGNITION WOULD "" FACILITATE DISCUSSION""  BUT NOTHING MORE.   \n8.   MINISTER AHMED THEN PROCEEDED TO DESCRIBE PAK CONCERN OVER SOVIET ACTIVITIES AND INTENTIONS IN AREA,  NOTING ACCUMULATION OF DISTURBING EVIDENCE OF INCREASED SOVIET INTERFERENCE IN PAK AFFAIRS.   AS EXAMPLES CITED,  SOVIET INVOLVEMENT IN KARACHI LANGUAGE RIOTS AND KARACHI LABOR UNREST.   SOVIET AMBASSADOR HAD BEEN CONFRONTED WITH EVIDENCE,  INCLUDING FACT MONEY HAD BEEN PASSED.   SOVIET RESPONSE WAS TO SAY THAT USSR RECOGNIZED ONLY ONE GOVERNMENT IN PAKISTAN AND ONLY ONE PARTY,  BUT AHMED SAID GOP SAW THIS AS CAMOUFLAGE COVERING REAL SOVIET DESIGNS.   \n9.   THIS FURTHER APPARENT IN IRAQI ARMS DISCOVERY,  AN OPERATION APPARENTLY DIRECTED AT HEART OF COUNTRY;  SOVIET AMBASSADOR HAD BEEN CALLED IN ON THIS AND ASKED FOR COMMENT AND FOR STATEMENT PUBLICLY DISASSOCIATING   SOVIETS FROM AFFAIR.   SOVIET AMBASSADOR S RESPONSE HAD BEEN DEFENSIVE AT TIME AND THERE HAD BEEN NO FORMAL RESPONSE AT ANY TIME THEREAFTER.

INDIANS ALSO MASSING TROOPS ON PAK BORDERS;  WITH EXCEPTION OF 6  DIVISIONS IN NEFA/ ASSAM AREA AND ONE  CONFIDENTIAL         ARMORED DIVISION,  THE WHOLE OF THEIR ARMED FORCES WERE FOCUSED ON PAK BORDERS.   INTERESTINGLY ENOUGH,  THE WHOLE OF AFGHANISTAN S ARMY ALSO WAS ON PAKISTAN S BORDERS.   \n0.   CLEARLY ALL THIS WAS NOT DIRECTED AT CHINA;  PAKISTAN MUST THEREFORE ASK WHAT ITS PURPOSE MIGHT BE.   THERE WAS ALSO WHAT AMOUNTED TO "" IRON PINCERS CONCEPT""  ON PART SOVIETS;  ONE ARM APPARENT IN SOVIET ACTIVITY IN IRAQ AND SYRIA AND THE OTHER IN SOVIET PRESENCE IN INDIA AND AFGHANISTAN.   IN BETWEEN LAY IMPORTANT AREA OF IRAN,  PAKISTAN AND PERSIAN GULF.   AHMED SAID HE HAD DESCRIBED THESE CONCERNS TO CONGRESSIONAL COMMITTEES PREVIOUS DAY,  EMPHASIZING PAKISTAN S DESIRE FOR PEACE WITH INDIA AND STRONG CONCERN AS TO SOVIET AS WELL AS INDIAN INTENTIONS.   GOP MIGHT BE WRONG BUT IT APPEARED TO IT THAT SOVIET DESIGN   WAS    TO EITHER WEAN PAKISTAN FROM CHINESE INFLUENCE,  DISMEMBER THE COUNTRY FURTHER,  OR PERHAPS SIMPLY TO BRING PAKISTAN UNDER OVERALL SOVIET SECURITY UMBRELLA.   \n1.

AHEMD SAID HE HAD TOLD CONGRESSIONAL COMMITTEES THAT UNDER 1959  BILATERAL WITH US PAKISTAN FELT IT HAD COMMITMENT FROM US TO PROVIDE MILITARY ASSISTANCE;  YET THERE HAD BEEN NONE FOR PAST 7  YEARS.

DURING WASHINGTON VISIT MARCH 7-8,  PRESIDENT BHUTTO S SPECIAL EMISSARY GOVERNOR KHAR HAD MEETINGS WITH MEMBERS HFAC AND SENATE FOREIGN RELATIONS COMMITTEE.   AS IN MEETING WITH SECRETARY,  MINISTER OF STATE AHMED ACCOMPANIED AND DID MOST OF TALKING.   AHMED STAYED ON MARCH 9  AND KEPT MEETINGS SCHEDULED WITH SENATORS SCOTT AND MANSFIELD.\n2.   HOUSE COMMITTEE SESSION HAD 11  MEMBERS PRESENT, INCLUDING HAMILTON AND MORGAN-   SENATE SESSION INCLUDED AIKEN,  SPARKMAN,  MCGEE,  JAVITS AND M( GOVERN,  LATTER ONLY  LIMITED OFFICIAL USE\n3.   PRESENTATION BY MINISTER AHMED ESSENTIALLY SAME AS THAT MADE BY HIM TO SECRETARY;  I. E.  EMPHASIS ON INDIAN INTRANSIGENCE WHICH WAS UNDERMINING SIMLA SPIRIT,  STRONGLY EXPRESSED CONCERN  OVER SOVIET INTENTIONS,  AND PAKISTAN S NEED FOR HELP FROM ITS FRIENDS IF IT WAS TO AVOID BECOMING SOVIET/ INDIAN SATELLITE.\n4.   DURING MEETING WITH HFAC,  AHMED MADE SPECIFIC REFERENCE TO DOLS 1.1  MILLION IN MILITARY SPARE PARTS IN NY OWNED BY PAKISTAN BUT NOT SHIPPED BECAUSE OF EMBARGO. ALSO STRESSED THAT ALTHOUGH PAKISTAN DID NOT WISH US  MIL PRESENCE AND COULD UNDERSTAND WHY US DID NOT WISH TO BE DIRECTLY INVOLVED IN MILITARY MATTERS SOUTH ASIA, PAKIS AN VERY MUCH NEEDED ACCESS TO SOPHISTICATED US WEAPONS IF IT WAS TO MAINTAIN EFFECTIVE DETERRENT FORCE. AHMED TOLD MEMBERS THAT GOP HAD BEEN TOLD BY USG THAT CONGRESS OPPOSED TO MILITARY AID SOUTH ASIA. PAKISTAN COULD UNDERSTAND US CONCERN OVER FUTURE US MILITARY INVOLVEMENT OVERSEAS BUT WAS UNABLE UNDER- STAND WHY US OPPOSED TO COUNTRY LIKE PAKISTAN USING ITS OWN RESOURCES TO BUY EQUIPMENT IN US TO PROVIDE FOR ITS OWN SECURITY.   PAKISTAN NEEDED HELP;  US WAS ITS FRIEND;  IN INTEREST OF FUTURE WESTERN ROLE IN SOUTH ASIA, PAKISTAN HAD ASSUMED US WOULD WANT TO DEMONSTRATE THAT IT STOOD BY ITS FRIENDS.\n5.  RESPONSE BY COMMITTEE MEMBERS VARIED BUT THERE WAS GENERAL EMPHASIS ON PROBLEM OF PRIORITIES FACING US IN TERMS OVERSEAS INVOLVEMENT AND COMMITMENTS.   ALSO EMPHASIS ON IMPLICATIONS OF VIET NAM EXPERIENCE FOR FUTURE US ROLE ABROAD.   THERE WAS ALSO GENERAL CONSENSUS CONVEYED TO KHAR/ AHMED THAT WITH ELECTIONS COMPLETED IN BANGLADESH THERE WAS STRONG HOPE AND DESIRE IN US FOR COUNTRIES SOUTH ASIA TO GET ON WITH NEGOTIATIONS LEADING TO PEACEFUL ACCOMMODATION.\n6.   EMPHASIS BY AHMED IN MEETING WITH SENATE COMMITTEE WAS ON PAKISTAN S HOPE THAT US WOULD HELP ITS FRIENDS TO HELP THEMSELVES.   AHMED CONCEDED PAKISTAN GETTING HELP FROM CHINESE.   THIS DID NOT INCLUDE SOPHISTICATED  LIMITED OFFICIAL USE\n7.   RESPONSE BY SENATE COMMITTEE MEMBERS ESSENTIALLY ALONG SAME LINES AS THAT IN HOUSE BUT WITH PARTICULAR EMPHASIS BY MCGOVERN ON POSSIBLE IMPLICATIONS FOR ARMS RACE IN SOUTH ASIA SHOULD US RESUME MILITARY SUPPLY.  AHMED S RESPONSE WAS THAT US FAILURE TO RESUME SUPPLY OF ANY KIND WOULD CERTAINLY NOT STOP LARGE CURRENT SOVIET DELIVERIES TO INDIA,  WHEREAS SOME DEGREE OF US SUPPLY TO PAKISTAN MIGHT       ACT AS DETERRENT TO SOVIETS.   IN RESPONSE AIKEN QUERY WHETHER SOVIET CONCERN OVER CHINA MIGHT NOT CAUSE SOVIETS TO ACT IN MORE RESTRAINED MANNER IN SOUTH ASIA,  AHMED RESPONDED THAT THIS DID NOT SEEM TO BE HAPPENING.   IN SUPPORT HIS POSITION AHMED NOTED IRAQI ARMS DISCOVERY PAKISTAN AND APPARENT SOVIET INVOLVEMENT IN THAT AND OTHER ACTIVITY.    ROGERS\n",984520

AMB PHILLIPS AND MISOFF NAAS CALLED ON UNUSYG GUYER MARCH  13  FOR QUICK BRIEFING ON MINISTER OF STATE AZIZ AHMED S MEETING WITH SYG ON MARCH 9.  AT OUTSET GUYER SAID RESULTS OF RECENT UN INITIATIVES --  SYG VISIT TO SUBCONTINENT AND MEETING WITH AHMED --  "" WERE ZERO.""  HE PERSONALLY BELIEVED THAT UN "" HAD REACHED END OF ROAD FOR TIME BEING."" \n2.  RECAPITUALATING BRIEFLY,  GUYER STATED THAT MUJIB HAD SUGGESTED TO SYG EXHANGE OF BIHARIS FOR BENGALIS IN PAKISTAN.  THIS PROPOSAL,  WHICH SYG FELT DUTY BOUND TO PASS TO GOP,  WAS OF COURSE REJECTED BY PERMREP AKHUND.   CONFIDENTIAL        3.  GUYER HAD ALSO PROPOSED RECENTLY TO AKHUND ESTABLISHMENT OF TIME- TABLE FOR VARIOUS STEPS WHICH WOULD BE BASED FOR NEGOTIATING PURPOSES ON ASSURED DATE OF RECOGNITION OF BD BY PAKS,  WHICH HE TERMED "" X""  FACTOR.  UPON RECEIVING GOP AGREEMENT TO SPECIFIC DATE,  HE WOULD ATTEMPT IN NAME OF SYG TO WORK OUT SERIES OF STEPS,  SOME OF WHICH WOULD OCCUR BEFORE RECOGNITION ( "" X-"" )  AND OTHERS THAT WOULD FOLLOW RECOGNITION ("" X PLUS "").  EACH STEP,  INCLUDING RECOGNITION,  WOULD BE LINKED TO AND CONTINGENT UPON OTHER ACTIONS.  UN WOULD BE "" KEEPER OF THE FAITH""  AND WOULD PUBLICLY ANNOUNCE ANY VIOLATIONS OF AGREEMENT.  SUCH PLAN,  HE SAID,  WOULD PROTECT BHUTTO SINCE HE COULD BLAME UN IF AGGREEMENT FELL APART. \n4.  GUYER SAID HE WAS THINKING OF EXCHANGES OF CIVILIANS AND SOME POWS TAKING PLACE BEFORE RECOGNITION,  BUT REPATRIATION OF BULK OF POWS AND "" MORE VALUABLE BENGAIS""  ( MILITARY AND OFFICER LEVEL CIVIL SERVANTS)  WOULD TAKE PLACE AFTER RECOGNITION. \n5.  AZIZ AHMED WAS AWARE OF THIS PROPOSAL AND REJECTED IT DURING MEETING WITH SYG.  AHMED HAD COMMENTED THAT IN HIS WASHINGTON DISCUSSIONS  RECOGNITION ("" X"")  AS FIRST STEP HAD BEEN SUGGESTED AND ASSURED RELEASE OF POWS AND BENGALIS WOULD FOLLOW.  HE TOLD US OFFICIALS,  HE SAID,  THAT HE COULD AGREE IF RECOGNITION FOLLOWED OTHER STEPS.  HIS ANSWER WAS SAME FOR GUYER S THOUGHT;  RECOGNITION COULD NOT BE IN MIDDLE OF PROCESS BUT MUST BE FINAL STEP.  SCALI\n",976586

WE THINK A SATISFACTORY SOLUTION CAN BE FOUND IN WHICH THE GOVERNMENT OF  INDIA WOULD AGREE TO PROVIDE FOR OUR LOCAL EXPENSES FOR A FIXED PERIOD OF YEARS,  AGREE TO DEVOTE SOME FURTHER PART OF THE RESOURCES TO USEFUL ACTIVITIES WHICH WOULD BE CARRIED OUT  WHOLLY UNDER INDIAN DIRECTION,  AND THEN WRITE THE REST OFF.  ONCE THIS AGREEMENT IS REACHED THE MATTER WOULD BE DONE WITH FOR GOOD AND ALL.   I WOULD LIKE PERMISSION TO BEGIN DISCUSSIONS OF THIS WITH WHOMEVER THE PRIME MINISTER DESIGNATES.    \n2.   MRS.  GANDHI TOOK MILD EXCEPTION TO THE DESCRIPTION OF INDIA AS A WORLD POWER,  SAYING THAT INDIA DID NOT BELIEVE IN POWER POLITICS AND IN ANY EVENT DID NOT HAVE THE RESOURCES TO ACT  AS OTHER NATIONS HAD DONE IN THE PAST.   INDIA HAD BEEN INVADED FIVE TIMES SINCE OBTAINING FREEDOM.   THIS HAD CAUSED A DESPERATE     SECRET         STRAIN ON HER RESOURCES.   THE GOVERNMENT WAS NOT "" ON THE MAT""  WITH RESPECT TO THE AMERICAN DECISION TO RESUME ARMS SHIPMENTS.  ( HERE IS NDICATED THAT SHE ASSUMED WE WERE PRESENTING THE APC S AS NON- LETHAL EQUIPMENT AND THAT SOMEHOW A CASE COULD BE MADE FOR THIS POINT.)   SHE SAID SHE HOPED I WOULD HAVE A "" FRUITFUL MISSION""  ALTHOUGH "" YOU HAVE NOT MADE A GOOD BEGINNING.""   SHE WAS BEARISH ABOUT THE PROSPECTS FOR A PAKISTAN- BANGLADESH  SETTLEMENT,  BUT DID NOT TAKE THE LINE THAT THIS WOULD NOW BE THE FALUT OF THE UNITED STATES.   SHE EMPHASIZED THAT THIS IS A MATTER FOR THE TWO OF THEM TO SETTLE.   SHE RESPONDED QUITE POSITIVELY TO THE PROPOSAL TO BEGIN DISCUSSION ON THE BLOCKED RUPEE SITUATION AND I AM TO BE IN TOUCH WITH HERE SECRETARY TOMORROW TO GET THINGS UNDERWAY.   \n3.   A POINT OF POSSIBLE SPECIAL INTEREST:   THE PRIME MINISTER RAISED ON HER OWN THE SUBJECT OF PAKISTANI POW S.   SHE EXPLAINED THAT IT WAS A HEAVY BUFDEN ON INDIA S RESOURCES TO BE MAINTAINING THEM AND THAT SHE WOULD HOPE TO SEE THEM RETURNED EVEN THOUGH IT MEANT TURNING OVER 93,000  CRACK TROOPS.  \n4.

THE TREASURY MEMORANDUM IS ENORMOUSLY HELPFUL. I THINK THE TERMS ARE A BIT STIFF,  BUT I QUITE SEE THAT THEY ARE PUT FORTH,  AS THE MEMORANDUM STATES,  TO QTE STIMULATE UNQTE THOUGHT AND NOT QTE AS OUR DEFINITIVE WORD ON THIS PROBLEM UNQTE.  THE ONLY SERIOUS POINT ON WHICH I WOULD IMAGINE THE DEPARTMENT OF STATE MIGHT DIFFER HAS TO DO WITH THE PERIOD OF CONTINUED INDIAN PAYMENT OF US EXPENSES OVER HERE.  HAD THE SAULNIER REPORT GONE INTO EFFECT WHEN     SECRET\n5.  YOUR PEOPLEWOULD LIKE TO HAVE IT GO ON UNTIL 2000.  AM I WRONG THAT THE INDIANS COULD REASONABLY ( SIC)  EXPECT INFLATION  TO WIPE OUT THE DEBT BY THAT POINT?  IN ANY EVENT,  I AM HOPING FOR AN AGREEMENT THAT WILL BE OFSUFFICIENT POLITICAL BENEIFT TO THE INDIAN POLITICIANS NOW IN OFFICE THAT IT WILL IN TURN HELP THE PRESIDENT WITH THE PROBLEMS HE WILL BE DEALING WITH DURING THE NEXT FOUR YEARS.  ONE OF THE DIFFICULTIES IN THIS REGARD IS THAT AS BEST I CAN CALCULATE FROM NOW TO THE END OF THE CENTURY THERE IS GOING TO BE AN ANNUAL NET TRANSFER OF DOLLARS FROM THE GOVERNMENT OF INDIA TO THE GOVERNMENT OF THE UNITED STATES.  UNLESS,  THAT IS,  AN ENORMOUS AID PROGRAM STARTS UP AGAIN,  AND I DO NOT SEE THAT HAPPENING.  FOR ONE THING,  NEITHER GOVERNMENT SEEMS TO WANT IT.  HENCE --  GIVEN THE MANMADE DISASTER WHICH IS THE INDIAN ECONOMY --  I WOULD HOPE WE MIGHT BE SENSITIVE TO HOW MUCH AND HOW LONG WE REQUIRE THEM TO SUPPORT OUR OPERATION OVER HERE.  THE MAIN POINT,  HOWEVER,  IS THAT IF INDIA AND THE UNITED STATES ARE TO HAVE THE RELATIONS OF EQUALS WHICH THE PRESIDENT DESIRES,  WE CANNOT HAVE A SITUATION IN WHICH WE WILL ONE DAY OWN UPWARDS OF A FIFTH OF THEIR CURRENCY.  IT MAKES FOR NEUROSIS.\n2.  NO MATTER.  I DO NOT WANT TO TROUBLE YOUABOUT DETAILS.

PROBLEMS RELATED TO TOURISM DEVELOPMENT  LIMITED OFFICIAL USE\n3.  MOST INTERESTING QUESTION WHICH ADDRESSED DIRECTLY AND CRITICALLY BY SEVERAL LEADING POLITICAL LIGHTS IS THAT OF CONTINUATION OF RESTRICTED AREA AND INNERLINE PERMIT SYSTEM FOR TRAVEL TO MUCH OF NORTHEASTERN INDIA.  UNIFORM VIEW EX- PRESSED BY CHIEF MINISTERS OF WEST BENGAL,  MEGHALAYA AND TRI- PURA AND TOURISM MINISTERS OF ALL STATES WAS THAT RESTRICTIONS ON INDIAN TOURISTS ( WHICH IN FORCE FOR ALL OF ARUNACHAL PRADESH AND MAJOR PARTS OF NAGALAND AND MIZORAM) SHOULD BE REMOVED IMMEDIATELY AND THAT RESTRICTIONS ON FOREIGNERS SHOULD BE MODIFIED RADICALLY,  MEGHALAYA CHIEF MINISTER SANGMA CAUSTICALLY POINTED OUT THAT RESTRICTED AREA CONCEPT FOR HIS STATE BASED ON ASSUMPTION OF HOSTILE EAST PAKISTAN.  NOW THAT BANGLADESH LIBERATED,  THIS OBVIOUSLY NO LONGER PERTAINS.  MAGHALAYA S TOURISM MINISTER NICHOLS- ROY ( WHO HIMSELF KHASI- AMERICAN)  MADE MOST SPECIFIC PLEA FOR OPENING UP EASTERN INDIA TO FOREIGNERS EXCEPT IN THOSE AREAS WHERE "" NATIONAL SECURITY OR LOCAL DISTURBANCES CLEARLY DICTATE A RESTRICTIVE POLICY.""

COMMENT:  THIS ISSUE WORTH WATCHING BECAUSE,  ASIDE FROM QUESTION AT HAND-- TOURISM DEVELOPMENT-- WHICH IS ONE IN WHICH EASTERN STATES HAVE REAL CONCERNS AND INTEREST-- THERE IS BROADER ISSUE OF GOI S JUDGMENT ABOUT FOREIGNERS IN INDIA. SPECIFICALLY,  IN CASE OF EASTERN INDIA,  DOES GOI BELIEVE ( IN LINE WITH REGULAR PUBLIC ACCUSATIONS)  THAT FOREIGNERS DO OR ARE LIKELY TO ENGAGE IN SUBVERSIVE ACTIVITIES AMONGST TRIBAL GROUPS OF AREA.  FEELING HERE NOW IS THAT IF THE GOI DOES NOT HAVE SERIOUS CONCERN AND CONCRETE EVIDENCE OF PAST SUBVERSIVE ACTIVITIES OF FOREIGNERS,  THERE IS ENOUGH UNITED PRESSURE TO CAUSE RELAXATION OF EXISTING REGULATIONS.\n5.

IN RESPONSE JUSTICE MINISTER ISAJI TANAKA REPLIED THAT QTE SHOULD SUCH PERSON WISH TO COME FOR THAT PURPOSE, I WOULD BE WILLING TO APPROVE IT ( I. E.  ENTRY INTO JAPAN) UNQTE.  CONFIDENTIAL\n2.

NIKAIDO RATHER LAMELY TOLD PRESS THAT JUSTICE MINISTER TANAKA HAD MISTAKENLY THOUGHT QUESTION CONCERNED ENTRY OF GVN REPRESENTATIVES.  LATER IN DAY, REPORTERS QUESTIONED TANAKA ABOUT HIS RESPONSE IN DIET AND NIKAIDO S EXPLANATION THEREOF.  TANAKA TOLD REPORTERS THAT, NIKAIDO S EXPLANATION NOTWITHSTANDING,  HE HAD CLEARLY UNDER- STOOD THAT QUESTION CONCERNED ENTRY OF PRG REPRESENTATIVES, NOT GVN REPRESENTATIVES.  HOWEVER,  TANAKA ACKNOWLEDGED THAT NIKAIDO WAS CORRECT IN SAYING HE ( TANAKA)  HAD MADE SLIP- OF- THE- TONGUE,  BECAUSE HE ( TANAKA)  HAD FAILED TO STATE CONDITION UNDER WHICH HE WOULD BE WILLING ALLOW ENTRY OF PRG  REPRESENTATIVES. TANAKA SAID CONDITION WAS THAT GVN FIRST EXPRESS ITS UNDER- STANDING OF GOJ INTENTION TO ADMIT PRG REPS.  TANAKA ADDED THAT IF QUESTIONED FURTHER IN DIET,  HE WOULD SINCERELY APOLOGIZE FOR HAVING MADE SLIP- OF- THE- TONGUE.\n3.

( SUMMARY)  IN PRESS CONFERENCES AFTERNOON MARCH 26,  SPOKESMEN FOR GVN AND PRG INDICATED THAT NO PROGRESS WAS ACHIEVED IN THIRD PLENARY SESSION OF BILATERAL TALKS.   DAN FOR GVN SAID THAT ALL ATTEMPTS TO INITIATE NON- POLEMICAL DISCUSSION OF AGENDA WERE REBUFFED BY PRG,   WHICH CONCENTRATED ITS FIRE TODAY ON SUSPENSION OF US TROOP WITH-  DRAWAL.   PRG SPOKESMAN SAU BLAMED LACK OF PROGRESS ON GVN REFUSAL TO DISCUSS QUESTION OF DEMOCRATIC LIBERTIES.   FOURTH PLENARY WILL TAKE PLACE MARCH 30.  ( END SUMMARY)\n2.   GVN BRIEFING:   DAN NOTED THAT GVN DELEGATE VIEN AGAIN PRESENTED GVN VIEWS AS TO AGENDA PRIORITIES,  I. E.  DISCUSSION OF ELECTIONS,  NCNRC,  AND WITHDRAWAL/ DEMOBILIZATION OF TROOPS.   WITH RESPECT TO LATTER,  HE SAID PARIS AGREEMENT "" RECOGNIZED""  PRESENCE OF NVA IN SVN,  PRESENCE INIMICAL TO BOTH SELF- DETERMINATION AND PEACE.   PRG,  SAID DAN,  FOCUSSED ON PW/ TROOP WITHDRAWAL IMBROGLIO TO EXCLUSION OF MERE RELEVENT DISCUSSION.   DAN SAID GVN VIEW IS THAT QUESTION OF PW S IN LAOS,  AND THEIR RELATIONSHIP TO TROOP WITHDRAWAL,  WAS RESULT OF DIRECT US- DRV NEGOTIATIONS AND TWO SOUTH VIETNAMESE PARTIES WERE THEREFORE NOT COMPETENT TO DISCUSS IT.   WITH RESPECT TO NVA PRESENCE IN SVN,  DAN SIAD THAT VIEN INVITED PRG TO SUBSCRIBE TO A JOINT RESOLUTION CALLING FOR WITHDRAWAL OF ALL FOREIGN FORCES,   LIMITED OFFICIAL USE         LIMITED OFFICIAL USE     INVITATION WHICH PRG DECLINED.\n3.   IN Q AND A PERIOD,  DAN ELABORATED ON GVN VIEWS RE NVA TROOPS IN THE SOUTH,  SEPARATENESS OF TWO VIET- NAMS,  AND OBLIGATION OF DRV TO WITHDRAW ITS FORCES.   HE ALSO FOUND OCCASION TO PROVIDE EXHAUSTIVE LISTING OF COMMUNIST CEASEFIRE VIOLATIONS,  AND PARRIED COMMUNIST ( HUMANITE)  CORRESPONDENT S HECKLING ON SUBJECT OF DEMO-  CRATIC FREEDOMS IN SVN.\n4.   PRG BRIEFING:   SAU BEGAN WITH HIS OWN EXHAUSTIVE CATALOGUE OF ALLEGED US AND GVN VIOLATIONS OF THE PARIS AGREEMENT,  CITING VNAF SORTIE RATES, "" PHOENIX""  OPERATIONS,  DETENTION OF POLITICAL PRISONERS,  AND SUSPENSION OF US TROOP WITHDRAWAL.   HE BLASTED GVN REFUSAL TO DISCUSS QUESTION OF DEMOCRATIC LIBERTIES AND GVN DENIAL OF SAME TO ITS CITIZENS.   HE SAID THAT IN RESPONSE TO VIEN S SUGGESTED JOINT RESOLUTION CALLING FOR WITHDRAWAL OF FOREIGN FORCES,  HIEU HAD OFFERED A RESOLUTION REFERRING SPECIFICALLY AND SOLELY TO US TROOPS,  IN KEEPING WITH "" CORRECT""  INTERPRETATION OF AGREEMENT.   SAU CON-  CLUDED BY WARNING OF "" EXTREMELY GRAVE""  SITUATION DEVELOPING IN SVN AS RESULT OF US AND GVN ACTIONS.\n5.   DURING Q AND A,  SAU WAS PRESSED INSISTENTLY AS TO PRG RATIONALE FOR REFUSING TO ADDRESS QUESTION OF WITHDRAWAL/ DEMOBILIZATION OF FORCES,  SINCE ARTICLE 13  OF AGREEMENT CLEARLY PLACES DEMOBILIZATION ASPECT OF THIS WITHIN COMPETENCE OF BIPARTITE TALKS.   SAU OFFERED STANDARD THEOLOGY WITH RESPECT TO NVA TROOPS ( NOBODY HERE BUT US PLAF,  VIETNAMESE CAN DEFEND THEIR COUNTRY ANYWHERE ON NATIONAL SOIL,  ETC.).   AS FOR QUESTION OF DEMOBILIZATION,  SAU FINALLY ADMITTED THAT IT WAS LEGITIMATE TOPIC FOR BIPARTITE DISCUSSION,  BUT REPEATED PRG VIEW THAT IT CAN BE TAKEN UP ONLY AFTER MORE URGENT MATTERS ARE RESOLVED.

POLISH EYES THE                            GOAL OF THE PRESENT PROCESS IS MERELY NORMALIZATION NEVERTHELESS THE                            SETTLEMENT ACHIEVED BY THE FRGPOLISH TREATY OF DECEMBER 1970 AND                            RATIFIED BY BOTH SIDES LAST YEAR WAS A STEP OF FUNDAMENTAL LONGRANGE                            IMPORTANCE5 PERHAPS HOWEVER THE MOST STRIKING EXAMPLE OF POLANDS MOVEMENT

AND IF THE NUMBER OF FRATERNAL VISITS AMONG                            WARSAW PACT MEMBERS IS ANY SORT OF INDICATION THE POLES ARE DOING THEIR                            BID TO TRY TO FORGE THIS

GIEREK                            LEADERSHIP IS COUNTING HEAVILY UPON THE EXPECTED INFLUX OF ADVANCED                            WESTERN TECHNOLOGY KNOWHOW AND EQUIPMENT TO HELP SOLVE ITS LONGTERM

CERTAINLY SEE FURTHER EXPANDED ACTIVITY IN                            PURCHASES OF WESTERN TECHNOLOGY AND EQUIPMENT BUT THE ULTIMATE QUESTION                            IS HOW EFFECTIVE ALL THIS WILL BE IN IMPROVING PRODUCTIVITY AND CREATING                            GREATER INCENTIVES FOR BOTH MANAGERS AND WORKERS IN THE ABSENCE OF                            FUNDAMENTAL REFORMSDAVIES,frus1969-76ve15p1d44,"1.  DURING RECENT VISIT BY COMMERCE DEPUTY ASSISTANT SECRETARY STEVEN LAZARUS FOR MEETING OF WORKING GROUP ON BUSINESS FACILITIES OF JOINT TRADE COMMISSION,  LAZARUS AND AMBASSADOR CALLED ON MINISTER OF FOREIGN TRADE TADEUSZ OLECHOWSKI ON MARCH 4.  MAIN POINTS COVERED DURING CONVERSATION,  WHICH DEVELOPED INTO HOUR- AND- TWENTY- MINUTE TOUR D HORIZON OF U. S. - POLISH TRADE AND ECONOMIC RELATIONS,  ARE SUMMARIZED AS FOLLOWS.\n2.  BUSINESS FACILITIES.  MINISTER BEGAN CONVERSATION BY SAYING HE HAD "" GREEN LIGHT""  TO MOVE AHEAD RAPIDLY ON QUESTION OF IMPROVED BUSINESS FACILITIES FOR U. S. COMPANIES IN POLAND.  AS LONG AS IT WOULD REMAIN WITHIN REASONABLE AND ECONOMIC BOUND S,  AS MANY U. S.  COMMERCIAL REPRESENTATIONS AS POSSIBLE COULD BE ESTABLISHED HERE.  LIMITED OFFICIAL USE\n3.  MARITIME AGREEMENT.  OLECHOWSKI INDICATED THAT CONSIDER- ABLE TIME HAD PASSED SINCE THE NOVEMBER SESSION OF THE JOINT TRADE COMMISSION,  AND SAID THAT THE MINISTER OF SHIPPING WAS GROWING RESTIVE ABOUT WHEN DISCUSSIONS WOULD GET UNDER WAY ON THE PROPOSED AGREEMENT ON PORT ACCESS AND OTHER MARITIME MATTERS.  AMBASSADOR SAID THAT PART OF THE DIFFICULTY MAY STEM FROM QUESTION OF RECIPROCITY SINCE PROPOSAL WAS FOR ACCESS TO 40  U. S.  PORTS WHEREAS THERE WERE VIRTUALLY ONLY 3  POLISH PORTS.  OLECHOWSKI UNDERSCORED INTEREST OF POLISH MERCHANT MARINE IN GAINING IMPROVED ACCESS TO U. S.  PORTS AS A PRACTICAL COMMERCIAL MATTER.  HE SUGGESTED,  IF IT APPEARED IN WASHINGTON THAT CLARIFICATION OF OTHER ASPECTS OF THE PROPOSED MARITIME AGREEMENT REQUIRED STILL FURTHER TIME,  THAT A SPECIAL WORKING GROUP BE ESTABLISHED WITHOUT FURTHER DELAY TO DISCUSS ONLY THE QUESTION OF PORT ACCESS.  HE INDICATED  LIMITED OFFICIAL USE\n4.  LONG- TERM AGRICULTURAL AGREEMENT.  OLECHOWSKI NOTED BRIEFLY THAT ANOTHER ITEM OF UNFINISHED BUSINESS LEFT OVER FROM NOVEMBER WAS U. S.  PROPOSAL FOR LONG- TERM AGRICULTURAL AGREEMENT.  IF THE U. S.  SIDE WANTED TO PURSUE THIS,  THE GOP WAS READY.\n5.  LONG- TERM INDUSTRIAL COOPERATION AGREEMENT.  MINISTER SAID HE ALSO WISHED TO REMIND THE U. S.  SIDE THAT ANOTHER PENDING MATTER WAS THE GOP PROPOSAL FOR A TEN- YEAR BILATERAL  ECONOMIC,  INDUSTRIAL AND TECHNOLOGICAL COOPERATION AGREE- MENT.  HE NOTED THAT POLAND RECENTLY HAD CONCLUDED SUCH AGREEMENTS WITH NUMBER OF WESTERN COUNTRIES,  LATEST OF WHICH WOULD BE WITH UNITED KINGDOM,  WHICH HE WOULD SIGN IN LONDON ON MARCH 20.  CONCLUSION OF SUCH AN AGREEMENT WAS NOT REQUIRED IN ORDER FOR U. S.- POLISH ECONOMIC RELATIONS TO DEVELOP FURTHER,  OLECHOWSKI SAID,  BUT FROM THE STANDPOINT OF GOP IT WOULD BE BENEFICIAL TO DO SO. FOR EXAMPLE,  IT WOULD PROVIDE A "" GREEN LIGHT""  FOR POLISH ENTERPRISES IN DEALINGS WITH U. S.  FIRMS.  IF THE U. S. WOULD BE INTERESTED IN CONCLUDING AN AGREEMENT OF THIS SORT,  MINISTER SUGGESTED,  IT MIGHT BE ITEM WHICH COULD BE SIGNED DURING THE ANTICIPATED VISIT TO THE U. S.  SOME- TIME LATER THIS YEAR BY FIRST SECRETARY GIEREK.  IN RESPONSE,  LAZARUS SAID THAT ATTENTION OF COMMERCE AND  LIMITED OFFICIAL USE\n6.  INVITATION TO SECRETARY DENT .  MINISTER NOTED THAT THEY UNDERSTOOD FROM THEIR EMBASSY IN WASHINGTON THAT SECRETARY DENT PLANNING TO BE IN EUROPE IN MAY- JUNE PERIOD,  AND SAID GOP WOULD LIKE TO INVITE SECRETARY TO VISIT POLAND AS WELL.  IF HE COULD ACCEPT,  QUESTION WOULD NEED TO BE SETTLED WHETHER VISIT WOULD BE "" PERSONAL""  OR FOR PURPOSE OF CONVENING THIRD SESSION OF AMERICAN- POLISH TRADE COMMISSION.  OLECHOWSKI SAID HIS VIEW WAS THAT SESSION SHOULD BE HELD ONLY IF THERE WERE QUESTIONS TO DISCUSS.  IF THE MARITIME AND AGRICULTURAL ISSUES SHOULD, FOR EXAMPLE,  HAVE ALREADY BEEN DISPOSED OF BEFORE JUNE, THERE MIGHT NOT SEEM TO BE A NEED FOR ANOTHER FORMAL SESSION AT THAT TIME.  MINISTER SAID THAT,  EITHER WAY, THEY WOULD WARMLY WELCOME VISIT BY SECRETARY DENT. LAZARUS REPLIED THAT SECRETARY DENT WAS MAKING  LIMITED OFFICIAL USE\n7.  U. S .- POLISH TRADE.  OLECHOWSKI SAID HE HAD BEEN SOME- WHAT DISAPPOINTED IN REVIEWING CONTRACTS CONCLUDED FOR FIRST TWO MONTHS OF 1973  TO SEE THAT ONLY ABOUT $50  MILLION IN INDUSTRIAL GOODS HAD BEEN ORDERED FROM THE U. S.  RATHER THAN PREDICTED $100  MILLION.  HE HOPED THAT MINISTER LEJCZAK S VISIT TO U. S.  WOULD RESULT IN SUBSTANTIAL INCREASE IN PURCHAESE OF U. S.  MACHINERY AND EQUIPMENT. MORE WORRISONE,  HE SAID,  WAS WHETHER INCRASED RATE OF POLISH EXPORTS TO U. S. ( 17  PERCENT IN 1972)  COULD BE MAINTAINED.  GOLBALLY,  POLAND PLANNED TO INCREASE EXPORTS BY 18  PERCENT THIS YEAR,  WHEREAS IMPORTS WERE TO RISE BY 21-22  PERCENT, 30-40  PERCENT OF WHICH WOULD COME FROM THE WEST.  MINISTER REITERATED INTEREST OF GOP IN CONCLUDING INDUSTRIAL COOPERATION CONTRACTS WITH U. S. COMPANIES,  AND ALSO NOTED ALAN SCOTT DEAL FOR SAUSAGE PLANTS AS FIRST RECENT LARGE INDUSTRILA IMPORT CONTRACT.    AMBASSADOR SAID THAT,  AS HE HAD INDICATED TO THE MINISTER IN AN EARLIER MEETING,  WE TOO WERE INTERESTED IN DEVELOPING LONG - TERM TIES BETWEEN U. S.  AND POLISH INDUSTRY,  AND IN INCRASING EXPORTS OF MACHINERY AND EQUIPMENT.  WE WERE SORRY TO HAVE LEARNED RECENTLY THAT TWO U. S.  COMPANIES ( BORDEN AND EPSTEIN INTERNATIONAL), BIDDING AS PARTNERS,  HAD LOST LARGE CONTRACT FOR CONSTRUC- TION OF POWDERED MILK PLANTS.  EPSTEIN,  AMBASSADOR NOTED,  ALSO WAS STILL ACTIVELY BIDDING ON CONTRACT FOR TWO LARGE MEAT PLANT S.  ANOTHER EXAMPLE WAS INTERNATIONAL HARVESTER WHICH ALREADY HAD SIGNED ONE IMPORTANT CONTRACT HERE AND NOW WAS ACTIVELY SEEKING A SECOND,  IN THIS INSTANCE WITH THE URSUS TRACTOR WORKS.  AMBASSADOR SAID HE WISHED TO MAKE CLEAR THAT WE WERE NOT ASKING FOR ANY SPECIAL CONSIDERATION FOR U.  S.  BIDDERS.  HOWEVER,  WE DID FEEL THAT IT WAS VERY IMPORTANT THAT THE BIDS OF U. S.  LIMITED OFFICIAL USE\n",980454

BEGIN SUMMARY:  GIEREK S SPEECH IN POZNAN STRESSED THE IMPORTANCE OF CONTINUING THE PROCESS OF "" NORMALIZA- TION""  OF FRG RELATIONS WITH THE WARSAW PACT COUNTRIES. HIS REMARKS ON POLISH- FRG RELATIONS SHOWED CONTINUED POLISH DISSATISFACTION WITH THE PRESENT STATE OF AFFAIRS, BUT AT THE SAME TIME A DESIRE TO PURSUE THE DIALOGUE AND CARRY THE PROCESS OF "" NORMALIZATION""  FURTHER.  END SUMMARY\n2.  THE POLISH FIRST SECRETARY GIEREK IN A SPEECH TO A PARTY REPORTING- ELECTORAL CONFERENCE IN POZNAN ON MARCH 22 DEVOTED SOME WORDS TO THE FRG S RELATIONS WITH THE WARSAW PACT COUNTRIES AND WITH POLAND IN PARTICULAR.  THE SPEECH, WHICH DEALT LARGELY  WITH DOMESTIC MATTERS ( WE ASSUME FBIS CARRIED THE TEXT),  CONCLUDED WITH A DISCUSSION OF THE INTERNATIONAL SITUATION,  WITH PARTICULAR REFERENCE TO THE FRG.\n3.  GIEREK SAID IT WAS ESSENTIAL THAT THE NORMALIZATION PROCESS IN RELATIONS BETWEEN THE FRG AND THE SOCIALIST COUNTRIES BE CARRIED OUT TO ITS CONCLUSION.  HE CALLED FOR A RAPID SETTLEMENT BETWEEN THE FRG AND CZECHOSLOVAKIA THROUGH RECOGNITION OF THE NON- VALIDITY OF THE MUNICH TREATY ( NO MENTION OF AB INITIO),  FOR IMPLE- MENTATION OF THE GDR- FRB TREATY,  AND FOR ADMISSION OF BOTH GERMAN STATES TO THE UN.\n4.  THE ESTABLISHMENT OF LASTING PEACEFUL COEXISTENCE BETWEEN POLAND AND THE FRG,  GIEREK  SAID,  WAS A VITAL INTEREST FOR BOTH COUNTRIES AND FOR EUROPE.  HOWEVER,  THE\n5.  REGARDING TRADE,  HE SAID THERE HAD BEEN AN IMPORTANT INCREASE IN RECENT YEARS BETWEEN POLAND AND THE FRG,  WHICH SHOULD CONTINUE AND SHOULD EMBRACE "" NEW FORMS"", PARTICULARLY THAT OF INDUSTRIAL COOPERATION.  HOWEVER, THIS REQUIRES RESOLUTION OF A NUMBER OF PROBLEMS WHICH UP TO NOW HAVE SERIOUSLY LIMITED THESE RELATIONS.\n6.  GIEREK CONCLUDED THAT ALL THESE PROBLEMS WERE KNOWN TO THE FRG GOVERNMENT AND THAT FURTHER TALKS BETWEEN THE TWO COUNTRIES WERE REQUIRED.\n7.  COMMENT:  THIS IS THE MOST EXTENSIVE AND AUTHORITATIVE PUBLIC COMMENTARY ON POLISH- FRG RELATIONS MADE HERE IN  LIMITED OFFICIAL USE\n8.  AS A FOOTNOTE FRG CHARGE SIKORA LAST EVENING TOLD AN EMBASSY OFFICER THAT POLISH VICE MINISTER OF FOREIGN TRADE STRZELECKI WAS LEAVING FOR BONN TODAY,  MARCH 24.  IN DISCUSSING THE SPEECH,  HE SAID THAT HE THOUGHT THE TIMING OF GIEREK S REMARKS WAS NOT ACCI- DENTAL,  BUT HE REFUSED TO BE DRAWN OUT FURTHER,  OTHER THAN TO COMMENT SOMEWHAT ACIDLY THAT ONE COULD NOT REALLY SPEAK OF A "" DIALOGUE""  WHEN BOTH SIDES WERE SO ENTRENCHED IN THEIR POSITIONS.
