THE EMBASSY WELCOMES THE SECRETARYS AFFIRMATION OF HIS LIMITED OFFICIAL USE\n2. OUR VIEWS ON WAYS TO STRENGTHEN OUR COMMERCIAL OPERATIONS WERE STATED IN SOME DETAIL IN PARIS 5369 OF MARCH 21, 1972, AND PARIS 21641. WHERE ACTION ON THESE RECOMMENDATIONS LAY WITHIN OUR OWN POWER, WE HAVE ACTED. OUR ACTIONS HAVE BEEN CONCENTRATED IN THREE MAIN AREAS; (A) INVOLVING THE ENTIRE EMBASSY IN COMMERCIAL WORK TO THE EXTENT FEASIBLE. (B) REALLOCATING RESOURCES TO THE COMMERCIAL PROGRAM, AND (C) STRENGTHENING THE ROLE OF COMMERCIAL OFFICERS.\n3. IN THE FIRST AREA, WE HAVE ESTABLISHED AN EMBASSY TRADE PROMOTION COMMITTEE WITH REPRESENTATION FROM ALL THE MAJOR SECTIONS OF THE MEBASSY. THE PERIODIC MEETINGS OF THIS COMMITTEE HAVE GREATLY INCREASED THE AWARENESS OF THE IMPORTANCE OF COMMERCIAL WORK ON THE PART OF THE OTHER SECTIONS AND OF THE OPPORTUNITIES WHICH EXIST FOR A CONRIBUTION BY THEM. THE COMMITTEE HAS BEEN PARTICULARLY VALUABLE AS AN AGENCY FOR COORDINATING INTELLIGENCE ON MAJOR PROJECTS. WE HAVE ALSO STRENGTHENED OUR PROGRAM FOR SUPPORTING THE COMMERCIAL WORK OF THE CONSULATES.\n4. IN THE SECOND AREA, WE HAVE CREATED THE NUCLEUS OF AN ADDITIONAL INDUSTRY UNIT IN THE COMMERCIAL OFFICE BY TRANSFERRING TO THAT OFFICE AN FSO FROM ELSEWHERE IN THE CONOMIC SECTION AND WE ARE INVESTIGATING THE POSSIBILITY OF REASSIGNING TWO FRENCH NATIONALS IN ORDER TO FILL OUT THIS UNIT.\n5. IN THE THIRD AREA WE ARE EXPERIMENTING WITH THE TECHNIQUE OF SETTING UP TEMPORARY AD HOC TASK FORCES COMPRISED OF ECONOMIC AND COMMERCIAL OFFICERS TO DEAL WITH SPECIFIC PROBLEMS. ONE OF THE MAIN PURPOSES OF THIS EXPERIMENT IS TO ENHANCE THE ROLE OF COMMERCIAL OFFICERS BY INVOLVING THEM MORE EXTENSIVELY IN SUBSTANTIVE WORK. OUR EXPERIENCE WITH A TASK FORCE SET-UP TO EXAMINE THE EFFECTS OF THE ENERGY CRISIS ON THE FRENCH ECONOMY HAS BEEN PARTICULARLY ENCOURAGING.\n6. WE SHALL CONTINUE TO SEEK OPPORTUNITIES WITHIN THE LIMITS OF OUR OWN RESOURCES TO STRENGTHEN OUR COMMERCIAL PROGRAM. BUT WE BELIEVE THE DEPARTMENT SHOULD BE AWARE THAT IN THE SECOND AND THIRD AREAS THESE LIMITS ARE EXTREMELY NARROW. IN THE SECOND AREA, WE BELIEVE, AS WE STATED IN PARIS 5369, THAT A CASE CAN BE MADE FOR INCREASING THE PERSONNEL RESOURCES ASSIGNED TO COMMERCIAL WORK. BUT WE RECOGNIZE THAT THE PROSPECTS FOR OBTAINING ADDITIONAL POSITIONS ARE MEAGRE AND THAT THE ONLY SURE WAY TO INCREASE COMMERCIAL STAFF IS BY REALLOCATING RESOURCES INTERNALLY. AS WE NOTED ABOVE, WE HAVE ALREADY TAKEN CERTAIN STEPS IN THIS DIRECTION AND WE PLAN FURTHER STEPS. WE ARE ESTABLISHING AN EMBASSY TASK FORCE TO LOOK INTO THE POSSIBILITIES FOR TRANSFERRING POSITIONS FROM OTHER MISSION ACTIVITES WHICH WE BELIEVE ENJOY A LOWER PRIORITY THAN EXPORT PROMOTION. BUT IT SHOULD BE RECOGNIZED THAT IT IS EXTREMELY DIFFICULT FOR AN EMBASSY TO TRANSFER POSITIONS FROM, SAY, THE POLITICAL OR THE ADMINISTRATIVE SECTIONS TO THE COMMERCIAL SECTION WITHOUT A MUCH MORE AUTHORITATIVE ASSESSSMENT THAN IS NOW AVAILABLE OF U.S. OBJECTIVES AND PRIORITIES IN THE HOST COUNTRY AS WEIGHED AGAINST THE OVERALL VIEW OF US INTERESTS. WE BELIEVE THAT THE DEPARTMENT MUST DEVELOP A MUCH MORE EFFECTIVE INSTRUMENT THAN IT NOW POSSESSES FOR DETERMINING THESE OBJECTIVES AND PRIORITIES. A START HAS BEEN MADE IN THE EUROPEAN BUREAU WITH THE PARA SYSTEM, BUT IN THEIR PRESENT FORM THE PARA PAPERS COVER ONLY PA (POLICY ANALYSIS) BUT NOT RA (RESOURCE ALLOCATION). THEY ARE THUS INCAPABLE OF PROVIDING GUIDANCE AND AUTHORITY WHICH WOULD PERMIT A RATIONAL REALLOCATION OF RESOURCES WITHIN AN EMBASSY ON ANY BUT THE SMALLEST SCALE. WE BELIEVE THE DEPARTMENT SHOULD ASSIGN A HIGH PRIORITY TO THE PERFECTION OF THIS SYSTEM.\n7. THERE ARE SIMILAR LIMITATIONS ON THE ABILITY OF AN EMBASSY TO INCREASE THE INTEGRATION OF ECONOMIC AND COMMERCIAL WORK. OUR VIEWS ON THIS SUBJECT WILL BE STATED MORE FULLY IN OUR REPLY TO THE DEPARTMENTS A-10322. FOR THE PRESENT, SUFFICE IT TO SAY THAT, WITHOUT THE FULL BACKING OF THE VARIOUS WASINGTON AGENCIES WITH FOREIGN ECONOMIC RESPONSIBILITIES AND REPRESENTATION, IT IS SIMPLY UNREALISTIC TO TALK ABOUT THE INTEGRATION OF ANY POSITIONS EXCEPT THOSE OCCUPIED BY FSOS.\n8. A RECOMMENDATION MADE IN EARLIER MESSAGES WHICH WE SHOULD LIKE TO REPEAT IS THE ONE CONCERNING THE STRENGTHENING OF THE COMMERCE DISTRICT OFFICES. WITHOUT EFFECTIVE FOLLO-UP OF TRADE OPPORTUNITIES BY THESE OFFICES, MUCH OF THE FIELDS WORK WILL BE IN VAIN. A START HAS BEEN MADE IN THIS DIRECTION, BUT WE DO NOT BELIEVE IT IS ENOUGH.\n7.

THE COUNCIL HAS VERIFIED THAT ONE OF THESE ISLANDS-- CONFIDENTIAL THE ISLAND OF ITU ABA, KNOWN TO US AS LIGAW--IS NOW UNDER OCCUPATION BY NATIONALIST CHINESE FORCES WHO HAVE FORTIFIED THE ISLAND WITH GUN EMPLACEMENT AND WHO HAVE ON A NUMBER OF OCCASIONS, FIRED WARNING SHOTS ON RECONNAISSANCE AIR- CRAFT AND MARITIME VESSELS.\n3. THE COUNCIL IS OF THE UNANIMOUS OPINION THAT BECAUSE OF THE FAST PACE OF DEVELOPMENTS IN THE REGION AND BECAUSE OF THE PROXIMITY TO THE ISLAND TO OUR NATIONAL TERRITORY ITS OCCUPATION BY A FOREIGN POWER CONSTITUTES A SERIOUS THREAT TO OUR NATIONAL SECURITY.\n4. THE ISLAND HAS A STRATEGIC IMPORTANCE TO THE SECURITY OF THE PHILIPPINES. IT IS LOCATED 489 MILES FROM MANILA,\n5. IN 1957, WE AFFIRMED THAT THE SPRATLEY ISLAND GROUP FALLS UNDER THE DE FACTO TRUSTEESHIP OF THE ALLIED POWERS BY VIRTUE OF THE JAPANESE PEACE TREATY SIGNED AND CON- CLUDED IN SAN FRANCISCO ON SEPTEMBER 8, 1951, WHEREBY JAPAN RENOUNCED ALL HER RIGHTS, TITLE AND CLAIM TO THESE ISLANDS. BY VIRTUE OF THAT TRUSTEESHIP NO ONE MAY INTRO- DUCE TROOPS ON ANY OF THESE ISLANDS WITHOUT THE PERMISSION AND CONSENT OF THE ALLIED POWERS. OUR POSITION ON THIS MATTER REMAINS FIRM.\n6. BECAUSE THE CHINESE GARRISON ON LIGAW WAS ESTABLISHED ON THE ISLAND WITHOUT THE PERMISSION AND CONSENT OF THE ALLIES, WE HAVE REQUESTED THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT TO WITH- DRAW ITS TROOPS FROM THERE. THREE DAYS AGO THE FOREIGN OFFICE CONVEYED THAT REQUEST TO THE CHINESE EMBASSY IN MANILA, AND THE COUNCIL TODAY RATIFIED THAT DECISION.\n7. AT THE SAME TIME WE MUST ANNOUNCE THAT THE GOVERNMENT HAS TAKEN ADEQUATE STEPS TO PROTECT ITS INTERESTS AND THE INTERESTS OF ITS CITIZENS IN RELATION TO THE OTHER ISLANDS CONFIDENTIAL OF FREEDOMLAND.\n8. FREEDOMLAND REFERES TO THE 53 ISLAND GROUP, WITH THE EXCLUSION OF THE SPRATLEYS, WHICH FILIPINO EXPLORER TOMAS CLOMA EXPLORED AND OCCUPIED FROM 1950 TO 1974.  THESE ARE ISLANDS, ISLETS, CORAL REEFS, CAYS AND BANKS WHICH ARE REGARDED AS RES NULLIUS AND MAYBE ACQUIRED ACCORDING TO THE MODES OF ACQUISITION RECOGNIZED UNDER INTERNATIONAL LAW - AMONG WHICH IS OCCUPATION AND EFFECTIVE ADMINISTRATION.\n9.

THE EMBASSY WELCOMES THE SECRETARYS AFFIRMATION OF HIS LIMITED OFFICIAL USE\n2. OUR VIEWS ON WAYS TO STRENGTHEN OUR COMMERCIAL OPERATIONS WERE STATED IN SOME DETAIL IN PARIS 5369 OF MARCH 21, 1972, AND PARIS 21641. WHERE ACTION ON THESE RECOMMENDATIONS LAY WITHIN OUR OWN POWER, WE HAVE ACTED. OUR ACTIONS HAVE BEEN CONCENTRATED IN THREE MAIN AREAS; (A) INVOLVING THE ENTIRE EMBASSY IN COMMERCIAL WORK TO THE EXTENT FEASIBLE. (B) REALLOCATING RESOURCES TO THE COMMERCIAL PROGRAM, AND (C) STRENGTHENING THE ROLE OF COMMERCIAL OFFICERS.\n3. IN THE FIRST AREA, WE HAVE ESTABLISHED AN EMBASSY TRADE PROMOTION COMMITTEE WITH REPRESENTATION FROM ALL THE MAJOR SECTIONS OF THE MEBASSY. THE PERIODIC MEETINGS OF THIS COMMITTEE HAVE GREATLY INCREASED THE AWARENESS OF THE IMPORTANCE OF COMMERCIAL WORK ON THE PART OF THE OTHER SECTIONS AND OF THE OPPORTUNITIES WHICH EXIST FOR A CONRIBUTION BY THEM. THE COMMITTEE HAS BEEN PARTICULARLY VALUABLE AS AN AGENCY FOR COORDINATING INTELLIGENCE ON MAJOR PROJECTS. WE HAVE ALSO STRENGTHENED OUR PROGRAM FOR SUPPORTING THE COMMERCIAL WORK OF THE CONSULATES.\n4. IN THE SECOND AREA, WE HAVE CREATED THE NUCLEUS OF AN ADDITIONAL INDUSTRY UNIT IN THE COMMERCIAL OFFICE BY TRANSFERRING TO THAT OFFICE AN FSO FROM ELSEWHERE IN THE CONOMIC SECTION AND WE ARE INVESTIGATING THE POSSIBILITY OF REASSIGNING TWO FRENCH NATIONALS IN ORDER TO FILL OUT THIS UNIT.\n5. IN THE THIRD AREA WE ARE EXPERIMENTING WITH THE TECHNIQUE OF SETTING UP TEMPORARY AD HOC TASK FORCES COMPRISED OF ECONOMIC AND COMMERCIAL OFFICERS TO DEAL WITH SPECIFIC PROBLEMS. ONE OF THE MAIN PURPOSES OF THIS EXPERIMENT IS TO ENHANCE THE ROLE OF COMMERCIAL OFFICERS BY INVOLVING THEM MORE EXTENSIVELY IN SUBSTANTIVE WORK. OUR EXPERIENCE WITH A TASK FORCE SET-UP TO EXAMINE THE EFFECTS OF THE ENERGY CRISIS ON THE FRENCH ECONOMY HAS BEEN PARTICULARLY ENCOURAGING.\n6. WE SHALL CONTINUE TO SEEK OPPORTUNITIES WITHIN THE LIMITS OF OUR OWN RESOURCES TO STRENGTHEN OUR COMMERCIAL PROGRAM. BUT WE BELIEVE THE DEPARTMENT SHOULD BE AWARE THAT IN THE SECOND AND THIRD AREAS THESE LIMITS ARE EXTREMELY NARROW. IN THE SECOND AREA, WE BELIEVE, AS WE STATED IN PARIS 5369, THAT A CASE CAN BE MADE FOR INCREASING THE PERSONNEL RESOURCES ASSIGNED TO COMMERCIAL WORK. BUT WE RECOGNIZE THAT THE PROSPECTS FOR OBTAINING ADDITIONAL POSITIONS ARE MEAGRE AND THAT THE ONLY SURE WAY TO INCREASE COMMERCIAL STAFF IS BY REALLOCATING RESOURCES INTERNALLY. AS WE NOTED ABOVE, WE HAVE ALREADY TAKEN CERTAIN STEPS IN THIS DIRECTION AND WE PLAN FURTHER STEPS. WE ARE ESTABLISHING AN EMBASSY TASK FORCE TO LOOK INTO THE POSSIBILITIES FOR TRANSFERRING POSITIONS FROM OTHER MISSION ACTIVITES WHICH WE BELIEVE ENJOY A LOWER PRIORITY THAN EXPORT PROMOTION. BUT IT SHOULD BE RECOGNIZED THAT IT IS EXTREMELY DIFFICULT FOR AN EMBASSY TO TRANSFER POSITIONS FROM, SAY, THE POLITICAL OR THE ADMINISTRATIVE SECTIONS TO THE COMMERCIAL SECTION WITHOUT A MUCH MORE AUTHORITATIVE ASSESSSMENT THAN IS NOW AVAILABLE OF U.S. OBJECTIVES AND PRIORITIES IN THE HOST COUNTRY AS WEIGHED AGAINST THE OVERALL VIEW OF US INTERESTS. WE BELIEVE THAT THE DEPARTMENT MUST DEVELOP A MUCH MORE EFFECTIVE INSTRUMENT THAN IT NOW POSSESSES FOR DETERMINING THESE OBJECTIVES AND PRIORITIES. A START HAS BEEN MADE IN THE EUROPEAN BUREAU WITH THE PARA SYSTEM, BUT IN THEIR PRESENT FORM THE PARA PAPERS COVER ONLY PA (POLICY ANALYSIS) BUT NOT RA (RESOURCE ALLOCATION). THEY ARE THUS INCAPABLE OF PROVIDING GUIDANCE AND AUTHORITY WHICH WOULD PERMIT A RATIONAL REALLOCATION OF RESOURCES WITHIN AN EMBASSY ON ANY BUT THE SMALLEST SCALE. WE BELIEVE THE DEPARTMENT SHOULD ASSIGN A HIGH PRIORITY TO THE PERFECTION OF THIS SYSTEM.\n7. THERE ARE SIMILAR LIMITATIONS ON THE ABILITY OF AN EMBASSY TO INCREASE THE INTEGRATION OF ECONOMIC AND COMMERCIAL WORK. OUR VIEWS ON THIS SUBJECT WILL BE STATED MORE FULLY IN OUR REPLY TO THE DEPARTMENTS A-10322. FOR THE PRESENT, SUFFICE IT TO SAY THAT, WITHOUT THE FULL BACKING OF THE VARIOUS WASINGTON AGENCIES WITH FOREIGN ECONOMIC RESPONSIBILITIES AND REPRESENTATION, IT IS SIMPLY UNREALISTIC TO TALK ABOUT THE INTEGRATION OF ANY POSITIONS EXCEPT THOSE OCCUPIED BY FSOS.\n8. A RECOMMENDATION MADE IN EARLIER MESSAGES WHICH WE SHOULD LIKE TO REPEAT IS THE ONE CONCERNING THE STRENGTHENING OF THE COMMERCE DISTRICT OFFICES.

CHARACTERISTICS THE ONE WHICH HAS BEEN MOST SALIENT                            DURING I972 HAS BEEN THE SEVERAL MANIFESTATIONS OF GENERAL AMINS EXTREME XENOPHOBIA DURING THE

AND LOSS TO                            UGANDA RESULTED FROM THEIR ABHORRENCE OF SOME OF AMINS POLICIES AND HIS INABILITY TO                            PROVIDE AN ATMOSPHERE AND THE SUBSTANCE OF

THE AFRICAN SCENE ARE QUITE FEARFUL THAT AMIN WILL BE                            SUCCESSFUL AND THAT HE WILL THEREBY SET A VERY BAD EXAMPLE FOR THE                            REST OF AFRICA TO IMITATE FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE THESE FEARS ARE NOT                            WELLFOUNDED: HE PROBABLY WILL GET AWAY WITH IT IN THE SENSE THAT HE                            WILL ACHIEVE THE EXPULSION OF MOST OF THE NONUGANDANS WHO INHABITED THE                            COUNTRY AT THE BEGINNING OF 1972 BUT WE VERY MUCH DOUBT THAT UGANDA OR                            THE UGANDANS WILL BE ANY BETTER OFF FOR ALL THAT THE EXAMPLE THE                            GENERAL IS SETTING IN OUR VIEW IS PRECISELY HOW NOT TO RUN A                            COUNTRY5 US REACTIONS TO AND RELATIONS WITH THE AMIN REGIME AS FAR AS OUR OWN NATIONAL INTERESTS HAVE                            BEEN CONCERNED WHAT HAVE BEEN AMINS ACTIONS AND POLICIES THAT HAVE INVOLVED US MOST                            DIRECTLYA WE HAVE DEPLORED HIS EXPULSION OF THE ISRAELIS AND EVEN MORE HIS                            ANTIZIONIST CAMPAIGN WHICH HAS WASHED OVER AT TIMES INTO AN ANTIJEWISH                            CAMPAIGN WITH THE EVERPRESENT DANGER OF ACTIONS AGAINST AMERICAN JEWS                            BECAUSE OF THE GENERALS INABILITY OR UNWILLINGNESS TO DISTINGUISH                            BETWEEN ZIONISTS AND JEWS AND BETWEEN ISRAELIS AND JEWS OF OTHER                            NATIONALITIES AMIN HAS MADE                            FRIENDS WITH SOME OF THE MORE RADICAL ARABS AND HIS PARANOIAC FEAR OF                            THE ISRAELIS HAS CAUSED EVERYONE PROBLEMS AS HE GOES ABOUT LOOKING FOR                            ISRAELI AGENTS UNDER EVERY BED NO IMPROVEMENT HERE IS LIKELY ALTHOUGH

FEARS                            OF SOME ABOUT LARGE NUMBERS OF MURDERS AND OTHER FORMS OF BRUTALITY WERE                            NOT REALIZED FORTUNATELY BUT IT WAS A DRASTIC MOVE WHICH HAS DONE THE                            COUNTRY NO GOOD AND IT HAS BEEN A SERIOUS INSTANCE OF THE DENIAL OF                            FUNDAMENTAL HUMAN RIGHTS THERE WAS NOT MUCH WE COULD DO ABOUT IT AT THE                            TIME AND THERE IS NOT MUCH THAT ANYONE CAN DO ABOUT IT TODAY AS IT                            APPEARS TODAY TO BE A CLOSED AND DARK CHAPTER IN UGANDAS MODERN                            HISTORYC THE DRASTIC DECISION PROMISED BY THE GENERAL AGAINST THE BRITISH IS                            ONLY NOW UNFOLDING BUT WE ANTICIPATE THAT IT WILL END UP BEING MORE                            SERIOUS THAN IT SEEMS TODAY AS HAS BEEN THE CASE WITH MOST OF AMINS POLICIES A YEAR FROM NOW THERE                            WILL PROBABLY BE VERY FEW BRITISH LEFT IN UGANDA AND IN MOST CASES THIS                            WILL HAVE MEANT AN IMPROVERISHMENT OF THE COUNTRYD WE WERE DIRECTLY MOST CONCERNED OVER TWO ELEMENTS OF OUR BILATERAL                            RELATIONS: THE BROAD SWEEPING VERBAL ATTACKS ON THE US BY AMIN AND THE SEVERAL INCIDENTS OF                            MOLESTATION OF AMERICAN CITIZENS THE MOLESTATIONS STOPPED ABOUT OCTOBER                            1 THE VERBAL ATTACKS WITH THE ONE EXCEPTION OF AMINS TELEGRAM OF DEC 23 ON THE                            RESUMPTION OF THE BOMBINGS IN NORTH VIETNAM ALSO STOPPED AROUND                            OCTOBER 1 THESE CESSATIONS PROBABLY RESULTED PROM A VARIETY OF REASONS                            THE RENEWED EFFORTS OF THE DEPARTMENT AND THE EMBASSY IN AUGUST AND                            SEPTEMBER PROBABLY PLAYED A ROLE BUT WE NOW BELIEVE THAT A MAJOR REASON                            WAS MORE LIKELY AMINS                            PREOCCUPATTON WITH OTHER TARGETS HE SEEMS TO

CONSIDERED A GREATER THREAT                            TO HIS OWN SURVIVAL DURING THIS THREEMONTH PERIOD THE LAST QUARTER OF                            1972 WE WERE ABLE TO USE THE LULL TO OUR OWN ADVANTAGE NAMELY THE                            EXFILTRATION FROM THE COUNTRY OF THE PEACE CORPS CONTINGENT AND SEVERAL                            HUNDRED OTHER AMCITS THE TOTAL AMERICAN PRESENCE DROPPED IN THIS PERIOD                            FROM OVER 1000 TO AROUND 640 THE LAST THREE MONTHS OF THIS LULL ALSO                            GAVE US THE TIME NEEDED TO DEVELOP AN EE PLAN TAILORED TO THE                            GEOGRAPHIC PECULIARITIES OF UGANDA6 THE FUTURE WE SHOULD NOT HOWEVER BECOME COMPLACENT BECAUSE OF THE                            LULL WE MAY OUTLAST AMIN  AND                            HE HAS SO MANY ENEMIES THAT SUDDEN DEMISE WOULD SURPRISE NO ONE IN                            UGANDA BUT HE MAY ALSO BE AROUND FOR SOMETIME TO COME IF THE LATTER                            TURNS OUT TO BE THE CASE HE WILL LIKELY NEED SOME ADDITIONAL SCAPEGOATS                            TO EXPLAIN AWAY THE LOW STATE INTO WHICH HE HAS DRIVEN HIS COUNTRY AND                            PEOPLE THE US MAY WELL BECOME ONE OF THOSE SCAPEGOATS EITHER BECAUSE                            HE IS FRESH OUT OF OTHER CONVENIENT TARGETS WE ARE CONVENIENT BECAUSE                            WE ARE FOREIGN WESTERN IMPERALIST MOSTLY WHITE ETC OR BECAUSE                            ONE OF THE SEVERAL TIMEBOMBS THAT APPEAR TO US TO LIE ASTRIDE OUR                            RELATIONS WITH UGANDA HAS GONE OFF AND BROUGHT US TO THE GENERALS IMMEDIATE ATTENTION                            THESE TIMEBOMBS INCLUDE:A OUR HISTORICAL AND QUITE EVIDENT CLOSE ASSOCIATIONS WITH ISRAEL AS                            THAT COUNTRYS PRINCIPAL MILITARY FINANCIAL AND POLITICAL SUPPORTER                                AMIN IS SO VIOLENTLY                            ANTIISRAELI THAT HIS WRATH AGAINST THEM MAY IN TURN BE DIRECTED AT US                            AS ISRAELS FRIENDB THE POSSIBILITY THAT ANTIAMIN ELEMENTS IN THE US MAY ENGINEER A                            BOYCOTT OF UGANDAN COFEEE BY AMERICAN BUYERS THIS WOULD BE MOST LIKELY                            TO BRING AMINS WRATH DOWN ON US                            EVEN THOUGH WE HAD PLAYED NO ROLE IN THE AFFAIRC THE LAWSUITS NOW BEING PURSUED IN NEW YORK BY ISRAELI FIRMS WHICH                            ARE OWED MONEY BY AMINS                            GOVERNMENT THE USG IS LIABLE TO GET                            CAUGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF ONE OR MORE OF THESE SUITS AGAIN WITH THE                            CHANCES GOOD THAT AMIN WILL TURN                            ON US WHETHER WE ARE INNOCENT NOT INVOLVED OR NOTD AMINS NATIONALIZATION OF                            AMERICAN PROPERTY SUCH AS HARRY ENGELS ITS FIRM MIGHT EVENTUALLY                            TRIGGER THE HICKENLOOPER AMENDMENT WHICH WOULD BE REGARDED BY AMIN AS AN UNFRIENDLY ACTD OUR UNWILLINGNESS OR INABILITY TO PROVIDE UGANDA ANY FURTHER AID MAY                            STIMULATE THE GENERAL TO WRITE US OFF AS WORSE THAN USELESS WITH                            OBVIOUS IMPLICATIONS FOR OUR CONTINUED PRESENCE HERE7 IN CONCLUSION IT SEEMS FAIR TO SAY THAT MOST OF THESE POTENTIAL                            THREATS TO THE SMOOTH COURSE OF OUR RELATIONS WITH UGANDA ARE LARGELY                            MATTERS OUTSIDE USG CONTROL THERE IS NO                            REASON TO HOPE THAT WE WILL BE MORE FORTUNATE THAN WERE THE ISRAELIS AND

AND WE APPROACH THE SECOND ANNIVERSARY OF THE COUP THAT                            BROUGHT GENERAL AMIN TO POWER IN                            UGANDA WE FIND AMINS TO BE ONE                            OF THE MOST RADICAL IN THE SENSE OF EXTREMIST REGIMES TO HAVE APPEARED                            IN INDEPENDENT BLACK AFRICA A REGIME WHICH MUST BE CHARACTERIZED AS:                            RACIST

OPTIMISTIC THAT AMIN WILL                            CONTINUE TO LEAVE US ALONE FOR WE FORESEE THAT  IF HE REMAINS IN POWER                            HE WILL NEED ADDITIONAL SCAPEGOATS TO EXPLAIN

SUMMARY2 THE AMIN REGIME GENERAL                                AMINS REGIME MUST BE ONE OF                            THE MOST RADICAL TO HAVE APPEARED IN BLACK AFRICA SINCE THE ERA OF                            INDEPENDENCE BEGAN NOT RADICAL IN THE SENSE OF LEFTIST BUT MORE IN                            THE SENSE OF EXTREMIST THE POLICIES DECREED BY THE GENERAL DURING THE                            PAST TWELVE MONTHS HAVE BEEN BASED ON A RAMPAGING XENOPHOIA BUT THAT                            HAS NOT BEEN THE ONLY EXTREMIST CHARACTERISTIC OF THIS REGIME WITHOUT                            ANY FEAR OF EXAGGERATION IT CAN BE DESCRIBED AS:A RACIST: ENOUGH EVIDENCE IS PROVIDED BY THE TREATMENT OF THE CITIZEN                            ASIANS WHO WERE SINGLED OUT FOR NO OTHER REASON THAN THEIR RACIAL                            ORIGINB ERRATIC AND UNPREDICATABLE: GENERAL AMIN HAS JUMPED AND SHIFTED IN SO MANY DIFFERENT OFTEN                            CONTRADICTORY DIRECTIONS DURING THE PAST YEAR THAT MOST OBSERVERS OF                            THE UGANDAN SCENE HAVE LONG SINCE GIVEN UP TRYING TO PREDICT WHAT HIS                            NEXT MOVE WILL BEC BRUTAL: EVEN BARBARIC MIGHT NOT BE TOO STRONG A TERM TO DESCRIBE                            THE CAMPAIGN OF OPPRESSION AND VICTIMIZATION THAT HAS BEEN CARRIED OUT                            AGAINST THE BLACK UGANDAN ELITE ALL

BELLICOSE: WHEN HE CANNOT GET A HEADLINE ANY OTHER WAY AMIN IS FOND                            OF THREATENING ONE OR MORE OF HIS NEIGHBORS HIS FAVORITE TARGETS HAVE                            BEEN

                     MEGALOMANIAG RIDICULOUS: AMINS BUFFOONERY                            HAS BEEN TOO WELL PUBLICIZED TO REQUIRE ILLUSTRATION AND IT HAS PERHAPS                            NOT BEEN

IS PERHAPS NATURAL IF DEPLORABLE THAT WHAT USED TO BE A                            RELATIVELY PEACEFUL AND SECURE COUNTRY IS NOW PERVADED BY FEAR OF ITS OWN SECURITY FORCES3 BUT OF ALL OF THE CHARACTERISTICS THE ONE WHICH HAS BEEN MOST SALIENT                            DURING I972 HAS BEEN THE SEVERAL MANIFESTATIONS OF GENERAL AMINS EXTREME XENOPHOBIA DURING THE

AND LOSS TO                            UGANDA RESULTED FROM THEIR ABHORRENCE OF SOME OF AMINS POLICIES AND HIS INABILITY TO                            PROVIDE AN ATMOSPHERE AND THE SUBSTANCE OF

WILL AMIN GET                            AWAY WITH IT AS PEOPLE ARE FOND OF ASKING: THAT IS WILL UGANDA                            SURVIVE HIS XENOPHOBIA SOME                            OBSERVERS OF THE AFRICAN SCENE ARE QUITE FEARFUL THAT AMIN WILL BE                            SUCCESSFUL AND THAT HE WILL THEREBY SET A VERY BAD EXAMPLE FOR THE                            REST OF AFRICA TO IMITATE FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE THESE FEARS ARE NOT                            WELLFOUNDED: HE PROBABLY WILL GET AWAY WITH IT IN THE SENSE THAT HE                            WILL ACHIEVE THE EXPULSION OF MOST OF THE NONUGANDANS WHO INHABITED THE                            COUNTRY AT THE BEGINNING OF 1972 BUT WE VERY MUCH DOUBT THAT UGANDA OR                            THE UGANDANS WILL BE ANY BETTER OFF FOR ALL THAT THE EXAMPLE THE                            GENERAL IS SETTING IN OUR VIEW IS PRECISELY HOW NOT TO RUN A                            COUNTRY5 US REACTIONS TO AND RELATIONS WITH THE AMIN REGIME AS FAR AS OUR OWN NATIONAL INTERESTS HAVE                            BEEN CONCERNED WHAT HAVE BEEN AMINS ACTIONS AND POLICIES THAT HAVE INVOLVED US MOST                            DIRECTLYA WE HAVE DEPLORED HIS EXPULSION OF THE ISRAELIS AND EVEN MORE HIS                            ANTIZIONIST CAMPAIGN WHICH HAS WASHED OVER AT TIMES INTO AN ANTIJEWISH                            CAMPAIGN WITH THE EVERPRESENT DANGER OF ACTIONS AGAINST AMERICAN JEWS                            BECAUSE OF THE GENERALS INABILITY OR UNWILLINGNESS TO DISTINGUISH                            BETWEEN ZIONISTS AND JEWS AND BETWEEN ISRAELIS AND JEWS OF OTHER                            NATIONALITIES AMIN HAS MADE                            FRIENDS WITH SOME OF THE MORE RADICAL ARABS AND HIS PARANOIAC FEAR OF                            THE ISRAELIS HAS CAUSED EVERYONE PROBLEMS AS HE GOES ABOUT LOOKING FOR                            ISRAELI AGENTS UNDER EVERY BED NO IMPROVEMENT HERE IS LIKELY ALTHOUGH

FEARS                            OF SOME ABOUT LARGE NUMBERS OF MURDERS AND OTHER FORMS OF BRUTALITY WERE                            NOT REALIZED FORTUNATELY BUT IT WAS A DRASTIC MOVE WHICH HAS DONE THE                            COUNTRY NO GOOD AND IT HAS BEEN A SERIOUS INSTANCE OF THE DENIAL OF                            FUNDAMENTAL HUMAN RIGHTS THERE WAS NOT MUCH WE COULD DO ABOUT IT AT THE                            TIME AND THERE IS NOT MUCH THAT ANYONE CAN DO ABOUT IT TODAY AS IT                            APPEARS TODAY TO BE A CLOSED AND DARK CHAPTER IN UGANDAS MODERN                            HISTORYC THE DRASTIC DECISION PROMISED BY THE GENERAL AGAINST THE BRITISH IS                            ONLY NOW UNFOLDING BUT WE ANTICIPATE THAT IT WILL END UP BEING MORE                            SERIOUS THAN IT SEEMS TODAY AS HAS BEEN THE CASE WITH MOST OF AMINS POLICIES A YEAR FROM NOW THERE                            WILL PROBABLY BE VERY FEW BRITISH LEFT IN UGANDA AND IN MOST CASES THIS                            WILL HAVE MEANT AN IMPROVERISHMENT OF THE COUNTRYD WE WERE DIRECTLY MOST CONCERNED OVER TWO ELEMENTS OF OUR BILATERAL                            RELATIONS: THE BROAD SWEEPING VERBAL ATTACKS ON THE US BY AMIN AND THE SEVERAL INCIDENTS OF                            MOLESTATION OF AMERICAN CITIZENS THE MOLESTATIONS STOPPED ABOUT OCTOBER                            1 THE VERBAL ATTACKS WITH THE ONE EXCEPTION OF AMINS TELEGRAM OF DEC 23 ON THE                            RESUMPTION OF THE BOMBINGS IN NORTH VIETNAM ALSO STOPPED AROUND                            OCTOBER 1 THESE CESSATIONS PROBABLY RESULTED PROM A VARIETY OF REASONS                            THE RENEWED EFFORTS OF THE DEPARTMENT AND THE EMBASSY IN AUGUST AND                            SEPTEMBER PROBABLY PLAYED A ROLE BUT WE NOW BELIEVE THAT A MAJOR REASON                            WAS MORE LIKELY AMINS                            PREOCCUPATTON WITH OTHER TARGETS HE SEEMS TO

CONSIDERED A GREATER THREAT                            TO HIS OWN SURVIVAL DURING THIS THREEMONTH PERIOD THE LAST QUARTER OF                            1972 WE WERE ABLE TO USE THE LULL TO OUR OWN ADVANTAGE NAMELY THE                            EXFILTRATION FROM THE COUNTRY OF THE PEACE CORPS CONTINGENT AND SEVERAL                            HUNDRED OTHER AMCITS THE TOTAL AMERICAN PRESENCE DROPPED IN THIS PERIOD                            FROM OVER 1000 TO AROUND 640 THE LAST THREE MONTHS OF THIS LULL ALSO                            GAVE US THE TIME NEEDED TO DEVELOP AN EE PLAN TAILORED TO THE                            GEOGRAPHIC PECULIARITIES OF UGANDA6 THE FUTURE WE SHOULD NOT HOWEVER BECOME COMPLACENT BECAUSE OF THE                            LULL WE MAY OUTLAST AMIN  AND                            HE HAS SO MANY ENEMIES THAT SUDDEN DEMISE WOULD SURPRISE NO ONE IN                            UGANDA BUT HE MAY ALSO BE AROUND FOR SOMETIME TO COME IF THE LATTER                            TURNS OUT TO BE THE CASE HE WILL LIKELY NEED SOME ADDITIONAL SCAPEGOATS                            TO EXPLAIN AWAY THE LOW STATE INTO WHICH HE HAS DRIVEN HIS COUNTRY AND                            PEOPLE THE US MAY WELL BECOME ONE OF THOSE SCAPEGOATS EITHER BECAUSE                            HE IS FRESH OUT OF OTHER CONVENIENT TARGETS WE ARE CONVENIENT BECAUSE                            WE ARE FOREIGN WESTERN IMPERALIST MOSTLY WHITE ETC OR BECAUSE                            ONE OF THE SEVERAL TIMEBOMBS THAT APPEAR TO US TO LIE ASTRIDE OUR                            RELATIONS WITH UGANDA HAS GONE OFF AND BROUGHT US TO THE GENERALS IMMEDIATE ATTENTION                            THESE TIMEBOMBS INCLUDE:A OUR HISTORICAL AND QUITE EVIDENT CLOSE ASSOCIATIONS WITH ISRAEL AS                            THAT COUNTRYS PRINCIPAL MILITARY FINANCIAL AND POLITICAL SUPPORTER                                AMIN IS SO VIOLENTLY                            ANTIISRAELI THAT HIS WRATH AGAINST THEM MAY IN TURN BE DIRECTED AT US                            AS ISRAELS FRIENDB THE POSSIBILITY THAT ANTIAMIN ELEMENTS IN THE US MAY ENGINEER A                            BOYCOTT OF UGANDAN COFEEE BY AMERICAN BUYERS THIS WOULD BE MOST LIKELY                            TO BRING AMINS WRATH DOWN ON US                            EVEN THOUGH WE HAD PLAYED NO ROLE IN THE AFFAIRC THE LAWSUITS NOW BEING PURSUED IN NEW YORK BY ISRAELI FIRMS WHICH                            ARE OWED MONEY BY AMINS                            GOVERNMENT THE USG IS LIABLE TO GET                            CAUGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF

NATIONALIZATION OF                            AMERICAN PROPERTY SUCH AS HARRY ENGELS ITS FIRM MIGHT EVENTUALLY                            TRIGGER THE HICKENLOOPER AMENDMENT WHICH WOULD BE REGARDED BY AMIN AS AN UNFRIENDLY ACTD OUR UNWILLINGNESS OR INABILITY TO PROVIDE UGANDA ANY FURTHER AID MAY                            STIMULATE THE GENERAL TO WRITE US OFF AS WORSE THAN USELESS WITH                            OBVIOUS IMPLICATIONS FOR OUR CONTINUED PRESENCE HERE7 IN CONCLUSION IT SEEMS FAIR TO SAY THAT MOST OF THESE POTENTIAL                            THREATS TO THE SMOOTH COURSE OF OUR RELATIONS WITH UGANDA ARE LARGELY                            MATTERS OUTSIDE USG CONTROL THERE IS NO                            REASON TO HOPE THAT WE WILL BE MORE FORTUNATE THAN WERE THE ISRAELIS AND

AND WE APPROACH THE SECOND ANNIVERSARY OF THE COUP THAT                            BROUGHT GENERAL AMIN TO POWER IN                            UGANDA WE FIND AMINS TO BE ONE                            OF THE MOST RADICAL IN THE SENSE OF EXTREMIST REGIMES TO HAVE APPEARED                            IN INDEPENDENT BLACK AFRICA A REGIME WHICH MUST BE CHARACTERIZED AS:                            RACIST

            INDEPENDENCE BEGAN NOT RADICAL IN THE SENSE OF LEFTIST BUT MORE IN                            THE SENSE OF EXTREMIST THE POLICIES DECREED BY THE GENERAL DURING THE                            PAST TWELVE MONTHS HAVE BEEN BASED ON A RAMPAGING XENOPHOIA BUT THAT                            HAS NOT BEEN THE ONLY EXTREMIST CHARACTERISTIC OF THIS REGIME WITHOUT                            ANY FEAR OF EXAGGERATION IT CAN BE DESCRIBED AS:A RACIST: ENOUGH EVIDENCE IS PROVIDED BY THE TREATMENT OF THE CITIZEN                            ASIANS WHO WERE SINGLED OUT FOR NO OTHER REASON THAN THEIR RACIAL                            ORIGINB ERRATIC AND UNPREDICATABLE: GENERAL AMIN HAS JUMPED AND SHIFTED IN SO MANY DIFFERENT OFTEN                            CONTRADICTORY DIRECTIONS DURING THE PAST YEAR THAT MOST OBSERVERS OF                            THE UGANDAN SCENE HAVE LONG SINCE GIVEN UP TRYING TO PREDICT WHAT HIS                            NEXT MOVE WILL BEC BRUTAL: EVEN BARBARIC MIGHT NOT BE TOO STRONG A TERM TO DESCRIBE                            THE CAMPAIGN OF OPPRESSION AND VICTIMIZATION THAT HAS BEEN CARRIED OUT                            AGAINST THE BLACK UGANDAN ELITE ALL APPARENTLY WITH THE SANCTION OF THE                            GOVERNMENTD INEPT: THE LOW STATE OF THE ECONOMY AND OF GOVERNMENT ADMINISTRATION                            TODAY IS TRAGIC ESPECIALLY WHEN VIEWED AGAINST THE ENCOURAGING ECONOMIC                            POTENTIAL AND GENERALLY ABLE CIVIL SERVICE WITH WHICH THE COUNTRY WAS                            ENDOWED ONLY 24 MONTHS AGOE BELLICOSE: WHEN HE CANNOT GET A HEADLINE ANY OTHER WAY AMIN IS FOND                            OF THREATENING ONE OR MORE OF HIS NEIGHBORS HIS FAVORITE TARGETS HAVE                            BEEN TANZANIA RWANDA AND THE SUDAN HE HAS NOT ATTACKED KENYA AND                            ZAIRE PROBABLY BECAUSE HE IS AFRAID OF THEMF IRRATIONAL: AMIN NEARLY CONSISTENTLY HAS PURSUED POLICIES THAT HAVE                            SEEN INIMICAL TO THE WELFARE AND PROGRESS OF HIS OWN COUNTRY AND PEOPLE                            USUALLY OUT OF IGNORANCE BUT PERHAPS ALSO BECAUSE OF HIS PARANOIA AND                            MEGALOMANIAG RIDICULOUS: AMINS BUFFOONERY                            HAS BEEN TOO WELL PUBLICIZED TO REQUIRE ILLUSTRATION AND IT HAS PERHAPS                            NOT BEEN SURPRISING THAT HE IS AN EMBARRASSMENT TO MANY AFRICAN LEADERS                            WHO NONETHELESS HAVE BEEN RELUCTANT TO QUESTION PUBLICLY HIS FITNESS TO                            RULE IN SOME CASES PROBABLY BECAUSE THEIR OWN CREDENTIALS MAY NOT BE                            MUCH BETTERH MILITARISTIC SINCE THE REGIMES SOLE FIRM SUPPORT SEEMS TO BE THE                            ARMY IT IS PERHAPS NATURAL IF DEPLORABLE THAT WHAT USED TO BE A                            RELATIVELY PEACEFUL AND SECURE COUNTRY IS NOW PERVADED BY FEAR OF ITS OWN SECURITY FORCES3 BUT OF ALL OF THE CHARACTERISTICS THE ONE WHICH HAS BEEN MOST SALIENT                            DURING I972 HAS BEEN THE SEVERAL MANIFESTATIONS OF GENERAL AMINS EXTREME XENOPHOBIA DURING THE                            LAST THREE QUARTERS OF THIS PAST YEAR AMIN HAS DECREED THAT THE COUNTRY                            CAN GET ALONG WITHOUT IN FACT WOULD BE BETTER OFF WITHOUT:A ANY ISRAELIS WHO WERE PROVIDED MILITARY

AND LOSS TO                            UGANDA RESULTED FROM THEIR ABHORRENCE OF SOME OF AMINS POLICIES AND HIS INABILITY TO                            PROVIDE AN ATMOSPHERE AND THE SUBSTANCE OF INTERNAL SECURITY WHICH WOULD                            PERMIT THE VOLUNTEERS TO CARRY OUT THEIR ASSIGNMENTSSECTION 2 OF 2 KAMPALA 0001D THE FOREIGN MISSIONARIES WHO PROVIDE A GREAT DEAL OF THE

WILL AMIN GET                            AWAY WITH IT AS PEOPLE ARE FOND OF ASKING: THAT IS WILL UGANDA                            SURVIVE HIS XENOPHOBIA SOME                            OBSERVERS OF THE AFRICAN SCENE ARE QUITE FEARFUL THAT AMIN WILL BE                            SUCCESSFUL AND THAT HE WILL THEREBY SET A VERY BAD EXAMPLE FOR THE                            REST OF AFRICA TO IMITATE FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE THESE FEARS ARE NOT                            WELLFOUNDED: HE PROBABLY WILL GET AWAY WITH IT IN THE SENSE THAT HE                            WILL ACHIEVE THE EXPULSION OF MOST OF THE NONUGANDANS WHO INHABITED THE                            COUNTRY AT THE BEGINNING OF 1972 BUT WE VERY MUCH DOUBT THAT UGANDA OR                            THE UGANDANS WILL BE ANY BETTER OFF FOR ALL THAT THE EXAMPLE THE                            GENERAL IS SETTING IN OUR VIEW IS PRECISELY HOW NOT TO RUN A                            COUNTRY5 US REACTIONS TO AND RELATIONS WITH THE AMIN REGIME AS FAR AS OUR OWN NATIONAL INTERESTS HAVE                            BEEN CONCERNED WHAT HAVE BEEN AMINS ACTIONS AND POLICIES THAT HAVE INVOLVED US MOST                            DIRECTLYA WE HAVE DEPLORED HIS EXPULSION OF THE ISRAELIS AND EVEN MORE HIS                            ANTIZIONIST CAMPAIGN WHICH HAS WASHED OVER AT TIMES INTO AN ANTIJEWISH                            CAMPAIGN WITH THE EVERPRESENT DANGER OF ACTIONS AGAINST AMERICAN JEWS                            BECAUSE OF THE GENERALS INABILITY OR UNWILLINGNESS TO DISTINGUISH                            BETWEEN ZIONISTS AND JEWS AND BETWEEN ISRAELIS AND JEWS OF OTHER                            NATIONALITIES AMIN HAS MADE                            FRIENDS WITH SOME OF THE MORE RADICAL ARABS AND HIS PARANOIAC FEAR OF                            THE ISRAELIS HAS CAUSED EVERYONE PROBLEMS AS HE GOES ABOUT LOOKING FOR                            ISRAELI AGENTS UNDER EVERY BED NO IMPROVEMENT HERE IS LIKELY ALTHOUGH                            THE EMOTIONAL HIGH OR LOW POINTTHE TELEGRAM TO WALDHEIM ABOUT HILLAR PROBABLY LIES IN                            THE PASTB THE ASIAN EXPULSION WAS NOT AS BRUTAL AS HAD BEEN EXPECTED THE FEARS                            OF SOME ABOUT LARGE NUMBERS OF MURDERS AND OTHER FORMS OF BRUTALITY WERE                            NOT REALIZED FORTUNATELY BUT IT WAS A DRASTIC MOVE WHICH HAS DONE THE                            COUNTRY NO GOOD AND IT HAS BEEN A SERIOUS INSTANCE OF THE DENIAL OF                            FUNDAMENTAL HUMAN RIGHTS THERE WAS NOT MUCH WE COULD DO ABOUT IT AT THE                            TIME AND THERE IS NOT MUCH THAT ANYONE CAN DO ABOUT IT TODAY AS IT                            APPEARS TODAY TO BE A CLOSED AND DARK CHAPTER IN UGANDAS MODERN                            HISTORYC THE DRASTIC DECISION PROMISED BY THE GENERAL AGAINST THE BRITISH IS                            ONLY NOW UNFOLDING BUT WE ANTICIPATE THAT IT WILL END UP BEING MORE                            SERIOUS THAN IT SEEMS TODAY AS HAS BEEN THE CASE WITH MOST OF AMINS POLICIES A YEAR FROM NOW THERE                            WILL PROBABLY BE VERY FEW BRITISH LEFT IN UGANDA AND IN MOST CASES THIS                            WILL HAVE MEANT AN IMPROVERISHMENT OF THE COUNTRYD WE WERE DIRECTLY MOST CONCERNED OVER TWO ELEMENTS OF OUR BILATERAL                            RELATIONS: THE BROAD SWEEPING VERBAL ATTACKS ON THE US BY AMIN AND THE SEVERAL INCIDENTS OF                            MOLESTATION OF AMERICAN CITIZENS THE MOLESTATIONS STOPPED ABOUT OCTOBER                            1 THE VERBAL ATTACKS WITH THE ONE EXCEPTION OF AMINS TELEGRAM OF DEC 23 ON THE                            RESUMPTION OF THE BOMBINGS IN NORTH VIETNAM ALSO STOPPED AROUND                            OCTOBER 1 THESE CESSATIONS PROBABLY RESULTED PROM A VARIETY OF REASONS                            THE RENEWED EFFORTS OF THE DEPARTMENT AND THE EMBASSY IN AUGUST AND                            SEPTEMBER PROBABLY PLAYED A ROLE BUT WE NOW BELIEVE THAT A MAJOR REASON                            WAS MORE LIKELY AMINS                            PREOCCUPATTON WITH OTHER TARGETS HE SEEMS TO CONCENTRATE ON ONE ENEMY                            AT A TIME PLUS PERHAPS A DELIBERATE DECISION ON HIS PART TO LEAVE THE                            US ALONE WHILE HE DEALT WITH OTHERS WHOM HE CONSIDERED A GREATER THREAT                            TO HIS OWN SURVIVAL DURING THIS THREEMONTH PERIOD THE LAST QUARTER OF                            1972 WE WERE ABLE TO USE THE LULL TO OUR OWN ADVANTAGE NAMELY THE                            EXFILTRATION FROM THE COUNTRY OF THE PEACE CORPS CONTINGENT AND SEVERAL                            HUNDRED OTHER AMCITS THE TOTAL AMERICAN PRESENCE DROPPED IN THIS PERIOD                            FROM OVER 1000 TO AROUND 640 THE LAST THREE MONTHS OF THIS LULL ALSO                            GAVE US THE TIME NEEDED TO DEVELOP AN EE PLAN TAILORED TO THE                            GEOGRAPHIC PECULIARITIES OF UGANDA6 THE FUTURE WE SHOULD NOT HOWEVER BECOME COMPLACENT BECAUSE OF THE                            LULL WE MAY OUTLAST AMIN  AND                            HE HAS SO MANY ENEMIES THAT SUDDEN DEMISE WOULD SURPRISE NO ONE IN                            UGANDA BUT HE MAY ALSO BE AROUND FOR SOMETIME TO COME IF THE LATTER                            TURNS OUT TO BE THE CASE HE WILL LIKELY NEED SOME ADDITIONAL SCAPEGOATS                            TO EXPLAIN AWAY THE LOW STATE INTO WHICH HE HAS DRIVEN HIS COUNTRY AND                            PEOPLE THE US MAY WELL BECOME ONE OF THOSE SCAPEGOATS EITHER BECAUSE                            HE IS FRESH OUT OF OTHER CONVENIENT TARGETS WE ARE CONVENIENT BECAUSE                            WE ARE FOREIGN WESTERN IMPERALIST MOSTLY WHITE ETC OR BECAUSE                            ONE OF THE SEVERAL TIMEBOMBS THAT APPEAR TO US TO LIE ASTRIDE OUR                            RELATIONS WITH UGANDA HAS GONE OFF AND BROUGHT US TO THE GENERALS IMMEDIATE ATTENTION                            THESE TIMEBOMBS INCLUDE:A OUR HISTORICAL AND QUITE EVIDENT CLOSE ASSOCIATIONS WITH ISRAEL AS                            THAT COUNTRYS PRINCIPAL MILITARY FINANCIAL AND POLITICAL SUPPORTER                                AMIN IS SO VIOLENTLY                            ANTIISRAELI THAT HIS WRATH AGAINST THEM MAY IN TURN BE DIRECTED AT US                            AS ISRAELS FRIENDB THE POSSIBILITY THAT ANTIAMIN ELEMENTS IN THE US MAY ENGINEER A                            BOYCOTT OF UGANDAN COFEEE BY AMERICAN BUYERS THIS WOULD BE MOST LIKELY                            TO BRING AMINS WRATH DOWN ON US                            EVEN THOUGH WE HAD PLAYED NO ROLE IN THE AFFAIRC THE LAWSUITS NOW BEING PURSUED IN NEW YORK BY ISRAELI FIRMS WHICH                            ARE OWED MONEY BY AMINS                            GOVERNMENT THE USG IS LIABLE TO GET                            CAUGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF ONE OR MORE OF THESE SUITS AGAIN WITH THE                            CHANCES GOOD THAT AMIN WILL TURN                            ON US WHETHER WE ARE INNOCENT NOT INVOLVED OR NOTD AMINS NATIONALIZATION OF                            AMERICAN PROPERTY SUCH AS HARRY ENGELS ITS FIRM MIGHT EVENTUALLY                            TRIGGER THE HICKENLOOPER AMENDMENT WHICH WOULD BE REGARDED BY AMIN AS AN UNFRIENDLY ACTD OUR UNWILLINGNESS OR INABILITY TO PROVIDE UGANDA ANY FURTHER AID MAY                            STIMULATE THE GENERAL TO WRITE US OFF AS WORSE THAN USELESS WITH                            OBVIOUS IMPLICATIONS FOR OUR CONTINUED PRESENCE HERE7 IN CONCLUSION IT SEEMS FAIR TO SAY THAT MOST OF THESE POTENTIAL                            THREATS TO THE SMOOTH COURSE OF OUR RELATIONS WITH UGANDA ARE LARGELY                            MATTERS OUTSIDE USG CONTROL THERE IS NO                            REASON TO HOPE THAT WE WILL BE MORE FORTUNATE THAN WERE THE ISRAELIS AND                            THE BRITISH WHO WERE ALSO DONE IN PRIMARILY BY DEVELOPMENTS OVER WHICH                            THEY COULD EXERCISE LITTLE OR NO INFLUENCE IN VIEW OF THE ABOVE WE                            SHOULD CONTINUE TO TAKE STEPS QUIETLY TO REDUCE THE NUMBERS OR AMERICANS                            IN UGANDA TO AN ABSOLUTE MINIMUM AND TAKE OTHER APPROPRIATE STEPS THAT

EDOUARD BALLADUR,  NOW DEPUTY SECRETARY GENERAL AT THE  ELYSEE,  HAS BEEN NAMED TO REPLACE MICHEL JOBERT AS SECRETARY-  GENERAL.

AND WE APPROACH THE SECOND ANNIVERSARY OF THE COUP THAT                            BROUGHT GENERAL AMIN TO POWER IN                            UGANDA WE FIND AMINS TO BE ONE                            OF THE MOST RADICAL IN THE SENSE OF EXTREMIST REGIMES TO HAVE APPEARED                            IN INDEPENDENT BLACK AFRICA A REGIME WHICH MUST BE CHARACTERIZED AS:                            RACIST

SUMMARY2 THE AMIN REGIME GENERAL                                AMINS REGIME MUST BE ONE OF                            THE MOST RADICAL TO HAVE APPEARED IN BLACK AFRICA SINCE THE ERA OF                            INDEPENDENCE BEGAN NOT RADICAL IN THE SENSE OF LEFTIST BUT MORE IN                            THE SENSE OF EXTREMIST THE POLICIES DECREED BY THE GENERAL DURING THE                            PAST TWELVE MONTHS HAVE BEEN BASED ON A RAMPAGING XENOPHOIA BUT THAT                            HAS NOT BEEN THE ONLY EXTREMIST CHARACTERISTIC OF THIS REGIME WITHOUT                            ANY FEAR OF EXAGGERATION IT CAN BE DESCRIBED AS:A RACIST: ENOUGH EVIDENCE IS PROVIDED BY THE TREATMENT OF THE CITIZEN                            ASIANS WHO WERE SINGLED OUT FOR NO OTHER REASON THAN THEIR RACIAL                            ORIGINB ERRATIC AND UNPREDICATABLE: GENERAL AMIN HAS JUMPED AND SHIFTED IN SO MANY DIFFERENT OFTEN                            CONTRADICTORY DIRECTIONS DURING THE PAST YEAR THAT MOST OBSERVERS OF                            THE UGANDAN SCENE HAVE LONG SINCE GIVEN UP TRYING TO PREDICT WHAT HIS                            NEXT MOVE WILL BEC BRUTAL: EVEN BARBARIC MIGHT NOT BE TOO STRONG A TERM TO DESCRIBE                            THE CAMPAIGN OF OPPRESSION AND VICTIMIZATION THAT HAS BEEN CARRIED OUT                            AGAINST THE BLACK UGANDAN ELITE ALL APPARENTLY WITH THE SANCTION OF THE                            GOVERNMENTD INEPT: THE LOW STATE OF THE ECONOMY AND OF GOVERNMENT ADMINISTRATION                            TODAY IS TRAGIC ESPECIALLY WHEN VIEWED AGAINST THE ENCOURAGING ECONOMIC                            POTENTIAL AND GENERALLY ABLE CIVIL SERVICE WITH WHICH THE COUNTRY WAS                            ENDOWED ONLY 24 MONTHS AGOE BELLICOSE: WHEN HE CANNOT GET A HEADLINE ANY OTHER WAY AMIN IS FOND                            OF THREATENING ONE OR MORE OF HIS NEIGHBORS HIS FAVORITE TARGETS HAVE                            BEEN TANZANIA RWANDA AND THE SUDAN HE HAS NOT ATTACKED KENYA AND                            ZAIRE PROBABLY BECAUSE HE IS AFRAID OF THEMF IRRATIONAL: AMIN NEARLY CONSISTENTLY HAS PURSUED POLICIES THAT HAVE                            SEEN INIMICAL TO THE WELFARE AND PROGRESS OF HIS OWN COUNTRY AND PEOPLE                            USUALLY OUT OF IGNORANCE BUT PERHAPS ALSO BECAUSE OF HIS PARANOIA AND                            MEGALOMANIAG RIDICULOUS: AMINS BUFFOONERY                            HAS BEEN TOO WELL PUBLICIZED TO REQUIRE ILLUSTRATION AND IT HAS PERHAPS                            NOT BEEN SURPRISING THAT HE IS AN EMBARRASSMENT TO MANY AFRICAN LEADERS                            WHO NONETHELESS HAVE BEEN RELUCTANT TO QUESTION PUBLICLY HIS FITNESS TO                            RULE IN SOME CASES PROBABLY BECAUSE THEIR OWN CREDENTIALS MAY NOT BE                            MUCH BETTERH MILITARISTIC SINCE THE REGIMES SOLE FIRM SUPPORT SEEMS TO BE THE                            ARMY IT IS PERHAPS NATURAL IF DEPLORABLE THAT WHAT USED TO BE A                            RELATIVELY PEACEFUL AND SECURE COUNTRY IS NOW PERVADED BY FEAR OF ITS OWN SECURITY FORCES3 BUT OF ALL OF THE CHARACTERISTICS THE ONE WHICH HAS BEEN MOST SALIENT                            DURING I972 HAS BEEN THE SEVERAL MANIFESTATIONS OF GENERAL AMINS EXTREME XENOPHOBIA DURING THE                            LAST THREE QUARTERS OF THIS PAST YEAR AMIN HAS DECREED THAT THE COUNTRY                            CAN GET ALONG WITHOUT IN FACT WOULD BE BETTER OFF WITHOUT:A ANY ISRAELIS WHO WERE PROVIDED MILITARY

AND LOSS TO                            UGANDA RESULTED FROM THEIR ABHORRENCE OF SOME OF AMINS POLICIES AND HIS INABILITY TO                            PROVIDE AN ATMOSPHERE AND THE SUBSTANCE OF

WILL AMIN GET                            AWAY WITH IT AS PEOPLE ARE FOND OF ASKING: THAT IS WILL UGANDA                            SURVIVE HIS XENOPHOBIA SOME                            OBSERVERS OF THE AFRICAN SCENE ARE QUITE FEARFUL THAT AMIN WILL BE                            SUCCESSFUL AND THAT HE WILL THEREBY SET A VERY BAD EXAMPLE FOR THE                            REST OF AFRICA TO IMITATE FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE THESE FEARS ARE NOT                            WELLFOUNDED: HE PROBABLY WILL GET AWAY WITH IT IN THE SENSE THAT HE                            WILL ACHIEVE THE EXPULSION OF MOST OF THE NONUGANDANS WHO INHABITED THE                            COUNTRY AT THE BEGINNING OF 1972 BUT WE VERY MUCH DOUBT THAT UGANDA OR                            THE UGANDANS WILL BE ANY BETTER OFF FOR ALL THAT THE EXAMPLE THE                            GENERAL IS SETTING IN OUR VIEW IS PRECISELY HOW NOT TO RUN A                            COUNTRY5 US REACTIONS TO AND RELATIONS WITH THE AMIN REGIME AS FAR AS OUR OWN NATIONAL INTERESTS HAVE                            BEEN CONCERNED WHAT HAVE BEEN AMINS ACTIONS AND POLICIES THAT HAVE INVOLVED US MOST                            DIRECTLYA WE HAVE DEPLORED HIS EXPULSION OF THE ISRAELIS AND EVEN MORE HIS                            ANTIZIONIST CAMPAIGN WHICH HAS WASHED OVER AT TIMES INTO AN ANTIJEWISH                            CAMPAIGN WITH THE EVERPRESENT DANGER OF ACTIONS AGAINST AMERICAN JEWS                            BECAUSE OF THE GENERALS INABILITY OR UNWILLINGNESS TO DISTINGUISH                            BETWEEN ZIONISTS AND JEWS AND BETWEEN ISRAELIS AND JEWS OF OTHER                            NATIONALITIES AMIN HAS MADE                            FRIENDS WITH SOME OF THE MORE RADICAL ARABS AND HIS PARANOIAC FEAR OF                            THE ISRAELIS HAS CAUSED EVERYONE PROBLEMS AS HE GOES ABOUT LOOKING FOR                            ISRAELI AGENTS UNDER EVERY BED NO IMPROVEMENT HERE IS LIKELY ALTHOUGH                            THE EMOTIONAL HIGH OR LOW POINTTHE TELEGRAM TO WALDHEIM ABOUT HILLAR PROBABLY LIES IN                            THE PASTB THE ASIAN EXPULSION WAS NOT AS BRUTAL AS HAD BEEN EXPECTED THE FEARS                            OF SOME ABOUT LARGE NUMBERS OF MURDERS AND OTHER FORMS OF BRUTALITY WERE                            NOT REALIZED FORTUNATELY BUT IT WAS A DRASTIC MOVE WHICH HAS DONE THE                            COUNTRY NO GOOD AND IT HAS BEEN A SERIOUS INSTANCE OF THE DENIAL OF                            FUNDAMENTAL HUMAN RIGHTS THERE WAS NOT MUCH WE COULD DO ABOUT IT AT THE                            TIME AND THERE IS NOT MUCH THAT ANYONE CAN DO ABOUT IT TODAY AS IT                            APPEARS TODAY TO BE A CLOSED AND DARK CHAPTER IN UGANDAS MODERN                            HISTORYC THE DRASTIC DECISION PROMISED BY THE GENERAL AGAINST THE BRITISH IS                            ONLY NOW UNFOLDING BUT WE ANTICIPATE THAT IT WILL END UP BEING MORE                            SERIOUS THAN IT SEEMS TODAY AS HAS BEEN THE CASE WITH MOST OF AMINS POLICIES A YEAR FROM NOW THERE                            WILL PROBABLY BE VERY FEW BRITISH LEFT IN UGANDA AND IN MOST CASES THIS                            WILL HAVE MEANT AN IMPROVERISHMENT OF THE COUNTRYD WE WERE DIRECTLY MOST CONCERNED OVER TWO ELEMENTS OF OUR BILATERAL                            RELATIONS: THE BROAD SWEEPING VERBAL ATTACKS ON THE US BY AMIN AND THE SEVERAL INCIDENTS OF                            MOLESTATION OF AMERICAN CITIZENS THE MOLESTATIONS STOPPED ABOUT OCTOBER                            1 THE VERBAL ATTACKS WITH THE ONE EXCEPTION OF AMINS TELEGRAM OF DEC 23 ON THE                            RESUMPTION OF THE BOMBINGS IN NORTH VIETNAM ALSO STOPPED AROUND                            OCTOBER 1 THESE CESSATIONS PROBABLY RESULTED PROM A VARIETY OF REASONS                            THE RENEWED EFFORTS OF THE DEPARTMENT AND THE EMBASSY IN AUGUST AND                            SEPTEMBER PROBABLY PLAYED A ROLE BUT WE NOW BELIEVE THAT A MAJOR REASON                            WAS MORE LIKELY AMINS                            PREOCCUPATTON WITH OTHER TARGETS HE SEEMS TO CONCENTRATE ON ONE ENEMY                            AT A TIME PLUS PERHAPS A DELIBERATE DECISION ON HIS PART TO LEAVE THE                            US ALONE WHILE HE DEALT WITH OTHERS WHOM HE CONSIDERED A GREATER THREAT                            TO HIS OWN SURVIVAL DURING THIS THREEMONTH PERIOD THE LAST QUARTER OF                            1972 WE WERE ABLE TO USE THE LULL TO OUR OWN ADVANTAGE NAMELY THE                            EXFILTRATION FROM THE COUNTRY OF THE PEACE CORPS CONTINGENT AND SEVERAL                            HUNDRED OTHER AMCITS THE TOTAL AMERICAN PRESENCE DROPPED IN THIS PERIOD                            FROM OVER 1000 TO AROUND 640 THE LAST THREE MONTHS OF THIS LULL ALSO                            GAVE US THE TIME NEEDED TO DEVELOP AN EE PLAN TAILORED TO THE                            GEOGRAPHIC PECULIARITIES OF UGANDA6 THE FUTURE WE SHOULD NOT HOWEVER BECOME COMPLACENT BECAUSE OF THE                            LULL WE MAY OUTLAST AMIN  AND                            HE HAS SO MANY ENEMIES THAT SUDDEN DEMISE WOULD SURPRISE NO ONE IN                            UGANDA BUT HE MAY ALSO BE AROUND FOR SOMETIME TO COME IF THE LATTER                            TURNS OUT TO BE THE CASE HE WILL LIKELY NEED SOME ADDITIONAL SCAPEGOATS                            TO EXPLAIN AWAY THE LOW STATE INTO WHICH HE HAS DRIVEN HIS COUNTRY AND                            PEOPLE THE US MAY WELL BECOME ONE OF THOSE SCAPEGOATS EITHER BECAUSE                            HE IS FRESH OUT OF OTHER CONVENIENT TARGETS WE ARE CONVENIENT BECAUSE                            WE ARE FOREIGN WESTERN IMPERALIST MOSTLY WHITE ETC OR BECAUSE                            ONE OF THE SEVERAL TIMEBOMBS THAT APPEAR TO US TO LIE ASTRIDE OUR                            RELATIONS WITH UGANDA HAS GONE OFF AND BROUGHT US TO THE GENERALS IMMEDIATE ATTENTION                            THESE TIMEBOMBS INCLUDE:A OUR HISTORICAL AND QUITE EVIDENT CLOSE ASSOCIATIONS WITH ISRAEL AS                            THAT COUNTRYS PRINCIPAL MILITARY FINANCIAL AND POLITICAL SUPPORTER                                AMIN IS SO VIOLENTLY                            ANTIISRAELI THAT HIS WRATH AGAINST THEM MAY IN TURN BE DIRECTED AT US                            AS ISRAELS FRIENDB THE POSSIBILITY THAT ANTIAMIN ELEMENTS IN THE US MAY ENGINEER A                            BOYCOTT OF UGANDAN COFEEE BY AMERICAN BUYERS THIS WOULD BE MOST LIKELY                            TO BRING AMINS WRATH DOWN ON US                            EVEN THOUGH WE HAD PLAYED NO ROLE IN THE AFFAIRC THE LAWSUITS NOW BEING PURSUED IN NEW YORK BY ISRAELI FIRMS WHICH                            ARE OWED MONEY BY AMINS                            GOVERNMENT THE USG IS LIABLE TO GET                            CAUGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF ONE OR MORE OF THESE SUITS AGAIN WITH THE                            CHANCES GOOD THAT AMIN WILL TURN                            ON US WHETHER WE ARE INNOCENT NOT INVOLVED OR NOTD AMINS NATIONALIZATION OF                            AMERICAN PROPERTY SUCH AS HARRY ENGELS ITS FIRM MIGHT EVENTUALLY                            TRIGGER THE HICKENLOOPER AMENDMENT WHICH WOULD BE REGARDED BY AMIN AS AN UNFRIENDLY ACTD OUR UNWILLINGNESS OR INABILITY TO PROVIDE UGANDA ANY FURTHER AID MAY                            STIMULATE THE GENERAL TO WRITE US OFF AS WORSE THAN USELESS WITH                            OBVIOUS IMPLICATIONS FOR OUR CONTINUED PRESENCE HERE7 IN CONCLUSION IT SEEMS FAIR TO SAY THAT MOST OF THESE POTENTIAL                            THREATS TO THE SMOOTH COURSE OF OUR RELATIONS WITH UGANDA ARE LARGELY                            MATTERS OUTSIDE USG CONTROL THERE IS NO                            REASON TO HOPE THAT WE WILL BE MORE FORTUNATE THAN WERE THE ISRAELIS AND                            THE BRITISH WHO WERE ALSO DONE IN PRIMARILY BY DEVELOPMENTS OVER WHICH                            THEY COULD EXERCISE LITTLE OR NO INFLUENCE IN VIEW OF THE ABOVE WE                            SHOULD CONTINUE TO TAKE STEPS QUIETLY TO REDUCE THE NUMBERS OR AMERICANS                            IN UGANDA TO AN ABSOLUTE MINIMUM AND TAKE OTHER APPROPRIATE STEPS THAT

PROFESSOR B. R. SHENOY, OF THE ECONOMICS RESEARCH CENTRE, NEW DELHI, IS EVIDENTLY PLANNING TO WRITE TO ALL MEMBERS OF THE FOREIGN RELATIONS AND FOREIGN AFFAIRS AND AGRICUL- TURE COMMITTEES EXPRESSING HIS OPPOSITION TO THE RUPEE AGREEMENT. PROFESSOR SHENOY HAS BEEN ACTIVE FOR YEARS IN ATTACKING USG HOLDINGS OF RUPEES CLAIMING THAT THESE HOLDINGS WERE INFLATIONARY. WITH THE INITIALING OF A RUPEE AGREEMENT, HE HAS NOW COME TO THE ERRONEOUS CONCLUSION THAT ALL THESE RUPEE HOLDINGS WOULD BE ""MONETIZED"" AND THATTHIS WOULD CAUSE EVENTUAL INFLATION.\n2.  SHENOY IS CONSIDERED A DECENT BUT CRACKPOT ECONOMIST WHOSE PEARLS OF WISDOM HAVE OFTEN BEEN SENT TO VARIOUS US POLITICAL FIGURES. HIS WRITINGS APPEAR EXTENSIVELY IN THE FAR RIGHT WING PRESS IN INDIA, ALSO OCCASIONALLY IN MORE RESPECTABLE PUBLICATIONS.  THE INDIAN GOVERNMENT CONSIDERS HIM AN ECCENTRIC WHOM IT GENERALLY IGNORES.\n3.

OF THE MOST RADICAL IN THE SENSE OF EXTREMIST REGIMES TO HAVE APPEARED                            IN INDEPENDENT BLACK AFRICA A REGIME WHICH MUST BE CHARACTERIZED AS:                            RACIST ERRATIC AND UNPREDICTABLE BRUTAL INEPT BELLICOSE IRRATIONAL                            RIDICULOUS AND MILITARISTIC BUT ITS MOST SALIENT CHARACTERISTIC HAS                            BEEN AMINS RAMPANT XENOPHOBIA                            WHICH HAS RESULTED IN HIS SERIES OF DECREES THAT THE COUNTRY CAN GET                            ALONG WITHOUT WOULD BE BETTER OFF WITHOUT: ISRAELIS ASIANS FOREIGN                            VOLUNTEERS MISSIONARIES                            BRITISH THOUGH AMIN MAY GET                            AWAY WITH IT IN THE SENSE THAT HE WILL SUCCEED IN EXPELLING MOST                            NONUGANDANS FROM THE COUNTRY WE DOUBT HIS COUNTRY OR PEOPLE WILL BE                            ANY BETTER OFF FOR HIS POLICIES THE US HAS DEPLORED THE GENERALS                            ANTIZIONIST CAMPAIGN WHICH OFTEN BECOMES AN ANTIJEWISH CAMPAIGN AND                            THOUGH WE COULD DO LITTLE ABOUT IT WE WERE DISTRESSED BY THE EXPULSION                            OF THE ASIAN COMMUNITY AS A GROSS VIOLATION OF FUNDAMENTAL HUMAN RIGHTS                            THE DRASTIC DECISION AGAINST THE BRITISH IS ALSO DOING THE COUNTRY NO                            GOOD WE ACCOUNT FOR THE CESSATION OF VERBAL ATTACKS AGAINST THE US AND                            STOPPAGE OF THE INCIDENTS OF MOLESTATION OF OUR CITIZENSTHE TWO                            BILATERAL

    TO LEAVE US ALONE FOR THE PRESENT WE TOOK ADVANTAGE OF THE RECENT LULL                            TO REDUCE OUR PRESENCE IN THE COUNTRY BY OVER A THIRD WE ARE NOT                            OPTIMISTIC THAT AMIN WILL                            CONTINUE TO LEAVE US ALONE FOR WE FORESEE THAT  IF HE REMAINS IN POWER                            HE WILL NEED ADDITIONAL SCAPEGOATS TO EXPLAIN AWAY THE DIRE EFFECTS OF                            HIS POLICIES AND WE PROVIDE A CONVENIENT TARGET WE ALSO NOTE THE                            EXISTENCE OF SEVERAL TIME BOMBS THAT MAY EXPLODE TO DESTROY OUR                            RELATIONS WITH THE GOU: OUR HISTORICAL                            CLOSE TIES TO ISRAEL AMINS                            OBSESSIVE ENEMY THE POSSIBLITY OF A

CONTINUE QUIETLY TO REDUCE THE AFRICAN PRESENCE IN THE COUNTRY                            SO THAT WE WILL BE IN A BETTER POSITION TO COPE WITH FUTURE                            DEVELOPMENTS END SUMMARY2 THE AMIN REGIME GENERAL                                AMINS REGIME MUST BE ONE OF                            THE MOST RADICAL TO HAVE APPEARED IN BLACK AFRICA SINCE THE ERA OF                            INDEPENDENCE BEGAN NOT RADICAL IN THE SENSE OF LEFTIST BUT MORE IN                            THE SENSE OF EXTREMIST THE POLICIES DECREED BY THE GENERAL DURING THE                            PAST TWELVE MONTHS HAVE BEEN BASED ON A RAMPAGING XENOPHOIA BUT THAT                            HAS NOT BEEN THE ONLY EXTREMIST CHARACTERISTIC OF THIS REGIME WITHOUT                            ANY FEAR OF EXAGGERATION IT CAN BE DESCRIBED AS:A RACIST: ENOUGH EVIDENCE IS PROVIDED BY THE TREATMENT OF THE CITIZEN                            ASIANS WHO WERE SINGLED OUT FOR NO OTHER REASON THAN THEIR RACIAL                            ORIGINB ERRATIC AND UNPREDICATABLE: GENERAL AMIN HAS JUMPED AND SHIFTED IN SO MANY DIFFERENT OFTEN                            CONTRADICTORY DIRECTIONS DURING THE PAST YEAR THAT MOST OBSERVERS OF                            THE UGANDAN SCENE HAVE LONG SINCE GIVEN UP TRYING TO PREDICT WHAT HIS                            NEXT MOVE WILL BEC BRUTAL: EVEN BARBARIC MIGHT NOT BE TOO STRONG A TERM TO DESCRIBE                            THE CAMPAIGN OF OPPRESSION AND VICTIMIZATION THAT HAS BEEN CARRIED OUT                            AGAINST THE BLACK UGANDAN ELITE ALL APPARENTLY WITH THE SANCTION OF THE                            GOVERNMENTD INEPT: THE LOW STATE OF THE ECONOMY AND OF GOVERNMENT ADMINISTRATION                            TODAY IS TRAGIC ESPECIALLY WHEN VIEWED AGAINST THE ENCOURAGING ECONOMIC                            POTENTIAL AND GENERALLY ABLE CIVIL SERVICE WITH WHICH THE COUNTRY WAS                            ENDOWED ONLY 24 MONTHS AGOE BELLICOSE: WHEN HE CANNOT GET A HEADLINE ANY OTHER WAY AMIN IS FOND                            OF THREATENING ONE OR MORE OF HIS NEIGHBORS HIS FAVORITE TARGETS HAVE                            BEEN TANZANIA RWANDA AND THE SUDAN HE HAS NOT ATTACKED KENYA AND                            ZAIRE PROBABLY BECAUSE HE IS AFRAID OF THEMF IRRATIONAL: AMIN NEARLY CONSISTENTLY HAS PURSUED POLICIES THAT HAVE                            SEEN INIMICAL TO THE WELFARE AND PROGRESS OF HIS OWN COUNTRY AND PEOPLE                            USUALLY OUT OF IGNORANCE BUT PERHAPS ALSO BECAUSE OF HIS PARANOIA AND                            MEGALOMANIAG RIDICULOUS: AMINS BUFFOONERY                            HAS BEEN TOO WELL PUBLICIZED TO REQUIRE ILLUSTRATION AND IT HAS PERHAPS                            NOT BEEN SURPRISING THAT HE IS AN EMBARRASSMENT TO MANY AFRICAN LEADERS                            WHO NONETHELESS HAVE BEEN RELUCTANT TO QUESTION PUBLICLY HIS FITNESS TO                            RULE IN SOME CASES PROBABLY BECAUSE THEIR OWN CREDENTIALS MAY NOT BE                            MUCH BETTERH MILITARISTIC SINCE THE REGIMES SOLE FIRM SUPPORT SEEMS TO BE THE                            ARMY IT IS PERHAPS NATURAL IF DEPLORABLE THAT WHAT USED TO BE A                            RELATIVELY PEACEFUL AND SECURE COUNTRY IS NOW PERVADED BY FEAR OF ITS OWN SECURITY FORCES3 BUT OF ALL OF THE CHARACTERISTICS THE ONE WHICH HAS BEEN MOST SALIENT                            DURING I972 HAS BEEN THE SEVERAL MANIFESTATIONS OF GENERAL AMINS EXTREME XENOPHOBIA DURING THE                            LAST THREE QUARTERS OF THIS PAST YEAR AMIN HAS DECREED THAT THE COUNTRY                            CAN GET ALONG WITHOUT IN FACT WOULD BE BETTER OFF WITHOUT:A ANY ISRAELIS WHO WERE PROVIDED MILITARY TRAINING TO HIS ARMY AND AIR                            FORCE AS WELL AS IMPORTANT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE IN OTHER AREAS PLUS                            THE WORK OF CONSTRUCTION COMPANIES DOING A GOOD MANY OF THE BIG                            GOVERNMENT DEVELOPMENT AND MILITARY PROJECTSB SOME 50000 ASIANS WHO PROVIDED THE MASS OF THE COUNTRYS BUSINESS                            SKILLS IN TRADE DISTRIBUTION AND LIGHT INDUSTRY AS WELL AS                            PROFESSIONAL AND SKILLED ARTISANAL TALENTS OF ALL KINDS THE COUNTRYS                            ESSENTIAL MIDDLECLASS PLUS AT LEAST TWO OF ITS BIGGEST INDUSTRIAL                            ENTERPRISES WHICH DOMINATED THE LEADING MODERN SECTOR OF THE                            ECONOMYC THE FOREIGN VOLUNTEERS WHO PLAYED A KEY ROLE IN THE COUNTRYS                            EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM AS WELL AS PROVIDING TECHNICAL EXPERTISE IN OTHER                            SECTORS THOUGH THEY WERE NOT EXPELLED THEIR DEPARTURE AND LOSS TO                            UGANDA RESULTED FROM THEIR ABHORRENCE OF SOME OF AMINS POLICIES AND HIS INABILITY TO                            PROVIDE AN ATMOSPHERE AND THE SUBSTANCE OF INTERNAL SECURITY WHICH WOULD                            PERMIT THE VOLUNTEERS TO CARRY OUT THEIR ASSIGNMENTSSECTION 2 OF 2 KAMPALA 0001D THE FOREIGN MISSIONARIES WHO PROVIDE A GREAT DEAL OF THE MEDICAL AND                            EDUCATIONAL AS WELL AS RELIGIOUS SERVICES OF THE COUNTRY MOSTLY FREE                            OF CHARGE AS WELL AS FINANCING EDUCATIONAL AND MEDICAL INSTITUTIONS                            ESPECIALLY IN THE RURAL AREAS WHERE THESE TEND TO BE NEGLECTED BY                            CENTRAL GOVERNMENTE THE BRITISH EXPATRIATE COMMUNITY WHO PROVIDE BUSINESS SKILLS                            TEACHERS ADMINISTRATORS AND OTHER TECHNICIANS AND WHO ALONG WITH THE                            ASIANS AND THE MISSTONARIES REALLY CARRY THE BURDEN OF ADMINTSTRATION                            MEDICINE AND EDUCATION IN THE COUNTRY AS WELL AS KEY ECONOMIC SECTORS                            SUCH AS BANKING AND DEVELOPMENT FINANCING4 THE QUESTION IS WILL AMIN GET                            AWAY WITH IT AS PEOPLE ARE FOND OF ASKING: THAT IS WILL UGANDA                            SURVIVE HIS XENOPHOBIA SOME                            OBSERVERS OF THE AFRICAN SCENE ARE QUITE FEARFUL THAT AMIN WILL BE                            SUCCESSFUL AND THAT HE WILL THEREBY SET A VERY BAD EXAMPLE FOR THE                            REST OF AFRICA TO IMITATE FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE THESE FEARS ARE NOT                            WELLFOUNDED: HE PROBABLY WILL GET AWAY WITH IT IN THE SENSE THAT HE                            WILL ACHIEVE THE EXPULSION OF MOST OF THE NONUGANDANS WHO INHABITED THE                            COUNTRY AT THE BEGINNING OF 1972 BUT WE VERY MUCH DOUBT THAT UGANDA OR                            THE UGANDANS WILL BE ANY BETTER OFF FOR ALL THAT THE EXAMPLE THE                            GENERAL IS SETTING IN OUR VIEW IS PRECISELY HOW NOT TO RUN A                            COUNTRY5 US REACTIONS TO AND RELATIONS WITH THE AMIN REGIME AS FAR AS OUR OWN NATIONAL INTERESTS HAVE                            BEEN CONCERNED WHAT HAVE BEEN AMINS ACTIONS AND POLICIES THAT HAVE INVOLVED US MOST                            DIRECTLYA WE HAVE DEPLORED HIS EXPULSION OF THE ISRAELIS AND EVEN MORE HIS                            ANTIZIONIST CAMPAIGN WHICH HAS WASHED OVER AT TIMES INTO AN ANTIJEWISH                            CAMPAIGN WITH THE EVERPRESENT DANGER OF ACTIONS AGAINST AMERICAN JEWS                            BECAUSE OF THE GENERALS INABILITY OR UNWILLINGNESS TO DISTINGUISH                            BETWEEN ZIONISTS AND JEWS AND BETWEEN ISRAELIS AND JEWS OF OTHER                            NATIONALITIES AMIN HAS MADE                            FRIENDS WITH SOME OF THE MORE RADICAL ARABS AND HIS PARANOIAC FEAR OF                            THE ISRAELIS HAS CAUSED EVERYONE PROBLEMS AS HE GOES ABOUT LOOKING FOR                            ISRAELI AGENTS UNDER EVERY BED NO IMPROVEMENT HERE IS LIKELY ALTHOUGH                            THE EMOTIONAL HIGH OR LOW POINTTHE TELEGRAM TO WALDHEIM ABOUT HILLAR PROBABLY LIES IN                            THE PASTB THE ASIAN EXPULSION WAS NOT AS BRUTAL AS HAD BEEN EXPECTED THE FEARS                            OF SOME ABOUT LARGE NUMBERS OF MURDERS AND OTHER FORMS OF BRUTALITY WERE                            NOT REALIZED FORTUNATELY BUT IT WAS A DRASTIC MOVE WHICH HAS DONE THE                            COUNTRY NO GOOD AND IT HAS BEEN A SERIOUS INSTANCE OF THE DENIAL OF                            FUNDAMENTAL HUMAN RIGHTS THERE WAS NOT MUCH WE COULD DO ABOUT IT AT THE                            TIME AND THERE IS NOT MUCH THAT ANYONE CAN DO ABOUT IT TODAY AS IT                            APPEARS TODAY TO BE A CLOSED AND DARK CHAPTER IN UGANDAS MODERN                            HISTORYC THE DRASTIC DECISION PROMISED BY THE GENERAL AGAINST THE BRITISH IS                            ONLY NOW UNFOLDING BUT WE ANTICIPATE THAT IT WILL END UP BEING MORE                            SERIOUS THAN IT SEEMS TODAY AS HAS BEEN THE CASE WITH MOST OF AMINS POLICIES A YEAR FROM NOW THERE                            WILL PROBABLY BE VERY FEW BRITISH LEFT IN UGANDA AND IN MOST CASES THIS                            WILL HAVE MEANT AN IMPROVERISHMENT OF THE COUNTRYD WE WERE DIRECTLY MOST CONCERNED OVER TWO ELEMENTS OF OUR BILATERAL                            RELATIONS: THE BROAD SWEEPING VERBAL ATTACKS ON THE US BY AMIN AND THE SEVERAL INCIDENTS OF                            MOLESTATION OF AMERICAN CITIZENS THE MOLESTATIONS STOPPED ABOUT OCTOBER                            1 THE VERBAL ATTACKS WITH THE ONE EXCEPTION OF AMINS TELEGRAM OF DEC 23 ON THE                            RESUMPTION OF THE BOMBINGS IN NORTH VIETNAM ALSO STOPPED AROUND                            OCTOBER 1 THESE CESSATIONS PROBABLY RESULTED PROM A VARIETY OF REASONS                            THE RENEWED EFFORTS OF THE DEPARTMENT AND THE EMBASSY IN AUGUST AND                            SEPTEMBER PROBABLY PLAYED A ROLE BUT WE NOW BELIEVE THAT A MAJOR REASON                            WAS MORE LIKELY AMINS                            PREOCCUPATTON WITH OTHER TARGETS HE SEEMS TO CONCENTRATE ON ONE ENEMY                            AT A TIME PLUS PERHAPS A DELIBERATE DECISION ON HIS PART TO LEAVE THE                            US ALONE WHILE HE DEALT WITH OTHERS WHOM HE CONSIDERED A GREATER THREAT                            TO HIS OWN SURVIVAL DURING THIS THREEMONTH PERIOD THE LAST QUARTER OF                            1972 WE WERE ABLE TO USE THE LULL TO OUR OWN ADVANTAGE NAMELY THE                            EXFILTRATION FROM THE COUNTRY OF THE PEACE CORPS CONTINGENT AND SEVERAL                            HUNDRED OTHER AMCITS THE TOTAL AMERICAN PRESENCE DROPPED IN THIS PERIOD                            FROM OVER 1000 TO AROUND 640 THE LAST THREE MONTHS OF THIS LULL ALSO                            GAVE US THE TIME NEEDED TO DEVELOP AN EE PLAN TAILORED TO THE                            GEOGRAPHIC PECULIARITIES OF UGANDA6 THE FUTURE WE SHOULD NOT HOWEVER BECOME COMPLACENT BECAUSE OF THE                            LULL WE MAY OUTLAST AMIN  AND                            HE HAS SO MANY ENEMIES THAT SUDDEN DEMISE WOULD SURPRISE NO ONE IN                            UGANDA BUT HE MAY ALSO BE AROUND FOR SOMETIME TO COME IF THE LATTER                            TURNS OUT TO BE THE CASE HE WILL LIKELY NEED SOME ADDITIONAL SCAPEGOATS                            TO EXPLAIN AWAY THE LOW STATE INTO WHICH HE HAS DRIVEN HIS COUNTRY AND                            PEOPLE THE US MAY WELL BECOME ONE OF THOSE SCAPEGOATS EITHER BECAUSE                            HE IS FRESH OUT OF OTHER CONVENIENT TARGETS WE ARE CONVENIENT BECAUSE                            WE ARE FOREIGN WESTERN IMPERALIST MOSTLY WHITE ETC OR BECAUSE                            ONE OF THE SEVERAL TIMEBOMBS THAT APPEAR TO US TO LIE ASTRIDE OUR                            RELATIONS WITH UGANDA HAS GONE OFF AND BROUGHT US TO THE GENERALS IMMEDIATE ATTENTION                            THESE TIMEBOMBS INCLUDE:A OUR HISTORICAL AND QUITE EVIDENT CLOSE ASSOCIATIONS WITH ISRAEL AS                            THAT COUNTRYS PRINCIPAL MILITARY FINANCIAL AND POLITICAL SUPPORTER                                AMIN IS SO VIOLENTLY                            ANTIISRAELI THAT HIS WRATH AGAINST THEM MAY IN TURN BE DIRECTED AT US                            AS ISRAELS FRIENDB THE POSSIBILITY THAT ANTIAMIN ELEMENTS IN THE US MAY ENGINEER A                            BOYCOTT OF UGANDAN COFEEE BY AMERICAN BUYERS THIS WOULD BE MOST LIKELY                            TO BRING AMINS WRATH DOWN ON US                            EVEN THOUGH WE HAD PLAYED NO ROLE IN THE AFFAIRC THE LAWSUITS NOW BEING PURSUED IN NEW YORK BY ISRAELI FIRMS WHICH                            ARE OWED MONEY BY AMINS                            GOVERNMENT THE USG IS LIABLE TO GET                            CAUGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF ONE OR MORE OF THESE SUITS AGAIN WITH THE                            CHANCES GOOD THAT AMIN WILL TURN                            ON US WHETHER WE ARE INNOCENT NOT INVOLVED OR NOTD AMINS NATIONALIZATION OF                            AMERICAN PROPERTY SUCH AS HARRY ENGELS ITS FIRM MIGHT EVENTUALLY                            TRIGGER THE HICKENLOOPER AMENDMENT WHICH WOULD BE REGARDED BY AMIN AS AN UNFRIENDLY ACTD OUR UNWILLINGNESS OR INABILITY TO PROVIDE UGANDA ANY FURTHER AID MAY                            STIMULATE THE GENERAL TO WRITE US OFF AS WORSE THAN USELESS WITH                            OBVIOUS IMPLICATIONS FOR OUR CONTINUED PRESENCE HERE7 IN CONCLUSION IT SEEMS FAIR TO SAY THAT MOST OF THESE POTENTIAL                            THREATS TO THE SMOOTH COURSE OF OUR RELATIONS WITH UGANDA ARE LARGELY                            MATTERS OUTSIDE USG CONTROL THERE IS NO                            REASON TO HOPE THAT WE WILL BE MORE FORTUNATE THAN WERE THE ISRAELIS AND                            THE BRITISH WHO WERE ALSO DONE IN PRIMARILY BY DEVELOPMENTS OVER WHICH                            THEY COULD EXERCISE LITTLE OR NO INFLUENCE IN VIEW OF THE ABOVE WE                            SHOULD CONTINUE TO TAKE STEPS QUIETLY TO REDUCE THE NUMBERS OR AMERICANS                            IN UGANDA TO AN ABSOLUTE MINIMUM AND TAKE OTHER APPROPRIATE STEPS THAT                            WILL ASSURE MAXIMUM FLEXIBILITY IN CASE AMIN RESUMES THE ATTACK ON USMELADY,frus1969-76ve06d240,"1. THE EMBASSY WELCOMES THE SECRETARYS AFFIRMATION OF HIS LIMITED OFFICIAL USE\n2. OUR VIEWS ON WAYS TO STRENGTHEN OUR COMMERCIAL OPERATIONS WERE STATED IN SOME DETAIL IN PARIS 5369 OF MARCH 21, 1972, AND PARIS 21641. WHERE ACTION ON THESE RECOMMENDATIONS LAY WITHIN OUR OWN POWER, WE HAVE ACTED. OUR ACTIONS HAVE BEEN CONCENTRATED IN THREE MAIN AREAS; (A) INVOLVING THE ENTIRE EMBASSY IN COMMERCIAL WORK TO THE EXTENT FEASIBLE. (B) REALLOCATING RESOURCES TO THE COMMERCIAL PROGRAM, AND (C) STRENGTHENING THE ROLE OF COMMERCIAL OFFICERS.\n3. IN THE FIRST AREA, WE HAVE ESTABLISHED AN EMBASSY TRADE PROMOTION COMMITTEE WITH REPRESENTATION FROM ALL THE MAJOR SECTIONS OF THE MEBASSY. THE PERIODIC MEETINGS OF THIS COMMITTEE HAVE GREATLY INCREASED THE AWARENESS OF THE IMPORTANCE OF COMMERCIAL WORK ON THE PART OF THE OTHER SECTIONS AND OF THE OPPORTUNITIES WHICH EXIST FOR A CONRIBUTION BY THEM. THE COMMITTEE HAS BEEN PARTICULARLY VALUABLE AS AN AGENCY FOR COORDINATING INTELLIGENCE ON MAJOR PROJECTS. WE HAVE ALSO STRENGTHENED OUR PROGRAM FOR SUPPORTING THE COMMERCIAL WORK OF THE CONSULATES.\n4. IN THE SECOND AREA, WE HAVE CREATED THE NUCLEUS OF AN ADDITIONAL INDUSTRY UNIT IN THE COMMERCIAL OFFICE BY TRANSFERRING TO THAT OFFICE AN FSO FROM ELSEWHERE IN THE CONOMIC SECTION AND WE ARE INVESTIGATING THE POSSIBILITY OF REASSIGNING TWO FRENCH NATIONALS IN ORDER TO FILL OUT THIS UNIT.\n5. IN THE THIRD AREA WE ARE EXPERIMENTING WITH THE TECHNIQUE OF SETTING UP TEMPORARY AD HOC TASK FORCES COMPRISED OF ECONOMIC AND COMMERCIAL OFFICERS TO DEAL WITH SPECIFIC PROBLEMS. ONE OF THE MAIN PURPOSES OF THIS EXPERIMENT IS TO ENHANCE THE ROLE OF COMMERCIAL OFFICERS BY INVOLVING THEM MORE EXTENSIVELY IN SUBSTANTIVE WORK. OUR EXPERIENCE WITH A TASK FORCE SET-UP TO EXAMINE THE EFFECTS OF THE ENERGY CRISIS ON THE FRENCH ECONOMY HAS BEEN PARTICULARLY ENCOURAGING.\n6. WE SHALL CONTINUE TO SEEK OPPORTUNITIES WITHIN THE LIMITS OF OUR OWN RESOURCES TO STRENGTHEN OUR COMMERCIAL PROGRAM. BUT WE BELIEVE THE DEPARTMENT SHOULD BE AWARE THAT IN THE SECOND AND THIRD AREAS THESE LIMITS ARE EXTREMELY NARROW. IN THE SECOND AREA, WE BELIEVE, AS WE STATED IN PARIS 5369, THAT A CASE CAN BE MADE FOR INCREASING THE PERSONNEL RESOURCES ASSIGNED TO COMMERCIAL WORK. BUT WE RECOGNIZE THAT THE PROSPECTS FOR OBTAINING ADDITIONAL POSITIONS ARE MEAGRE AND THAT THE ONLY SURE WAY TO INCREASE COMMERCIAL STAFF IS BY REALLOCATING RESOURCES INTERNALLY. AS WE NOTED ABOVE, WE HAVE ALREADY TAKEN CERTAIN STEPS IN THIS DIRECTION AND WE PLAN FURTHER STEPS. WE ARE ESTABLISHING AN EMBASSY TASK FORCE TO LOOK INTO THE POSSIBILITIES FOR TRANSFERRING POSITIONS FROM OTHER MISSION ACTIVITES WHICH WE BELIEVE ENJOY A LOWER PRIORITY THAN EXPORT PROMOTION. BUT IT SHOULD BE RECOGNIZED THAT IT IS EXTREMELY DIFFICULT FOR AN EMBASSY TO TRANSFER POSITIONS FROM, SAY, THE POLITICAL OR THE ADMINISTRATIVE SECTIONS TO THE COMMERCIAL SECTION WITHOUT A MUCH MORE AUTHORITATIVE ASSESSSMENT THAN IS NOW AVAILABLE OF U.S. OBJECTIVES AND PRIORITIES IN THE HOST COUNTRY AS WEIGHED AGAINST THE OVERALL VIEW OF US INTERESTS. WE BELIEVE THAT THE DEPARTMENT MUST DEVELOP A MUCH MORE EFFECTIVE INSTRUMENT THAN IT NOW POSSESSES FOR DETERMINING THESE OBJECTIVES AND PRIORITIES. A START HAS BEEN MADE IN THE EUROPEAN BUREAU WITH THE PARA SYSTEM, BUT IN THEIR PRESENT FORM THE PARA PAPERS COVER ONLY PA (POLICY ANALYSIS) BUT NOT RA (RESOURCE ALLOCATION). THEY ARE THUS INCAPABLE OF PROVIDING GUIDANCE AND AUTHORITY WHICH WOULD PERMIT A RATIONAL REALLOCATION OF RESOURCES WITHIN AN EMBASSY ON ANY BUT THE SMALLEST SCALE. WE BELIEVE THE DEPARTMENT SHOULD ASSIGN A HIGH PRIORITY TO THE PERFECTION OF THIS SYSTEM.\n7. THERE ARE SIMILAR LIMITATIONS ON THE ABILITY OF AN EMBASSY TO INCREASE THE INTEGRATION OF ECONOMIC AND COMMERCIAL WORK. OUR VIEWS ON THIS SUBJECT WILL BE STATED MORE FULLY IN OUR REPLY TO THE DEPARTMENTS A-10322. FOR THE PRESENT, SUFFICE IT TO SAY THAT, WITHOUT THE FULL BACKING OF THE VARIOUS WASINGTON AGENCIES WITH FOREIGN ECONOMIC RESPONSIBILITIES AND REPRESENTATION, IT IS SIMPLY UNREALISTIC TO TALK ABOUT THE INTEGRATION OF ANY POSITIONS EXCEPT THOSE OCCUPIED BY FSOS.\n8. A RECOMMENDATION MADE IN EARLIER MESSAGES WHICH WE SHOULD LIKE TO REPEAT IS THE ONE CONCERNING THE STRENGTHENING OF THE COMMERCE DISTRICT OFFICES. WITHOUT EFFECTIVE FOLLO-UP OF TRADE OPPORTUNITIES BY THESE OFFICES, MUCH OF THE FIELDS WORK WILL BE IN VAIN. A START HAS BEEN MADE IN THIS DIRECTION, BUT WE DO NOT BELIEVE IT IS ENOUGH.\n7.

    SUCCEEDED IN SECURING THE THE SENIOR IEG OFFICIALS TO THE CONCEPT THAT                            AID WILL FLOW TO FINANCE SPECIFIC PROJECTS AND THAT THE RESULTANT AID

MILITARY FORCES IN ERITREA WOULD BE MAINTAINED THE ELF MIGHT ALSO                            CALCULATE THAT ETHIOPIA WOULD ESTABLISH CLOSER RELATIONS WITH ITS                            NEIGHBORS AND

      BE AFFECTED IN THE MIDTERM HOWEVER IF THE IEG AND THE GSDR IN THE                            WAKE OF WHAT THEY PERCEIVED AS INCREASING UNLIKELIHOOD OF US SUPPORT OF

                     OUR MILITARY ASSISTANCE PROGRAM MAP WE JUDGE THAT THE IEG IS WELL                            AWARE OF BUDGETARY PRESSURES AND CURRENTS OF OPINION IN WASHINGTON WHICH                            CONSIDER THE MAP AS A DIRECT QUID PRO QUO FOR KAGNEW AND WHICH SURFACED LAST YEAR WHEW THE USG                            WAIVED THE LEGAL 10 PERCENT DOWNPAYMENT FOR MAP BECAUSE OF KAGNEW WE                            NOTE HOWEVER THAT ANY MAP REDUCTION COULD BE PARTIALLY CUSHIONED BY                            AID FOR EXAMPLE BY RELAXING CONDITIONS FOR THE USE OF CURRENT

MILITARY PROGRAMSB SOME ETHIOPIANS WOULD HAVE SIMILAR FEARS OF A MAJOR REDUCTION OF US                            ECONOMIC ASSISTANCE AID OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS HOWEVER WE HAVE                            SUCCEEDED IN SECURING THE THE SENIOR IEG OFFICIALS TO THE CONCEPT THAT                            AID WILL FLOW TO FINANCE SPECIFIC PROJECTS AND THAT THE RESULTANT AID                            LEVEL WILL ACCORDINGLY FLUCTUATE FROM YEAR TO YEAR WE WOULD HOPE THAT                            THE IEG WOULD CONTINUE TO ACCEPT THIS CONCEPT AFTER ANY CLOSURE OF                            KAGNEW AND NOT VIEW ANY DOWNTURNS IN AID AS KAGNEW RELATEDC WE JUDGE THAT DIRECT BENEFITS OF KAGNEW ARE LESS IMPORTANT TO IEG THAN                            OTHER US PROGRAMS IN ETHIOPIA PARTICULARLY MAP AND AID NEGATIVE                            ASPECTS PRIMARILY PSYCHOLOGICAL OF ANY KAGNEW PHASEOUT COULD                            PARTIALLY BE MITIGATED BY APPROPRIATE POLITICAL ACTION AND REASSURANCES                            ABOUT MILITARY AND DEVELOPMENT AIDD THE INITIAL IMPACT OF A DECISION TO PHASEOUT KAGNEW WOULD RESULT IN SOME CONTRACTION OF OUR                            ALREADY LIMITED DIPLOMATIC INFLUENCE ON THE IEG IF THIS DECISION WERE                            FOLLOWED BY A DOWNTURN IN A MAP AND PERHAPS AID AS WELL OUR ACCESS TO                            IEG POLICY MAKERS WOULD BE FURTHER CONTRACTED AND OUR PRESENT INFLUENCE                            ON IEG DEFENSE AND DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS WOULD DECREASE IF THIS                            DECISION AS IT BECAME PUBLIC KNOWLEDGE APPEARED TO LEAD TO AN INCREASE                            OF OPPOSITIONIST ACTIVITY OR EFFECTIVENESS EG BY THE ELF IEG                            GENERAL UNHAPPINESS WITH THE US COULD INCREASE EVEN FURTHER IT SHOULD                            RE RECOGN IZED HOWEVER THAT ON ISSUES DIRECTLY RELATED TO US                            INTERESTS SUCH AS POSSIBLE ON ACTION AGAINST TERRORISM OR ABILITY TO                            INFLUENCE THE IEG HAS ERODED OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS AS ETHIOPIA HAS                            INCREASINGLY SOUGHT IDENTIFY ITSELF WITH A GENERAL

 FRIENDLY RELATIONS WITH THE COMMUNIST POWERS PARTICULARLY THE USSR                            PATRON OF SOMALIA HOWEVER WE WOULD NOT EXPECT ETHIOPIA UNDER ITS                            PRESENT GOVERNMENT TO TURN TO THE USSR OR PRC FOR MILITARY ASSISTANCE                            OF SUCH SCOPE THAT IT WOULD GIVE EITHER POWER POLITICAL LEVERAGE ON THE                            lEG EVEN IF MAP WERE ALSO REDUCEDB THE INDUSTRIALIZED WORLD EUROPE AND JAPAN: US WITHDRAWAL FROM                            KAGNEW BY ITSELF WOULD HAVE LITTLE IMPACT ON ETHIOPIAN RELATIONS WITH

TURN FIRST TO EUROPE TO CLOSE THE GAP PARTICULARLY INSOFAR                            AS ITS MILITARY REQUIREMENTS ARE CONCERNEDCTHE THIRD WORLD: US WITHDRAWAL FROM KAGNEW WOULD ACCELERATE CLOSER

     THROUGH CASH GRANTS THIS                            POSSIBILITY HOWEVER WOULD DEPEND SIGNIFICANTLY ON CHANGES IN ETHIOPIAN                            RELATIONS WITH ISRAEL AND POSSIBLY ON SOME

ASKED ABOUT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN US AND YUGOSLAVIA ON WORLD PROBLEMS AND WHETHER THEY FOSTER MISUNDERSTANDINGS, RIBICIC SAID YUGOSLAVIA MAINTAINS POSITION THAT DIFFERENCES ON WORLD PROBLEMS SHOULD NOT STAND IN WAY OF WIDEST COOPERATION BILATERALLY IN ALL FIELDS OF COMMON INTEREST. THIS REGARD, HE REFERRED TO STRICT YUGOSLAV OBSERVANCE OF 1971 TITO-NIXON STATEMENT, SAYING YUGOSLAVS BELIEVE DIFFERENCES BOUND TO COME UP BUT YUGOSLAVS PLEAD FOR COMPREHENSIVE ADVANCEMENT AND DEVELOP- MENT OF MUTUAL RELATIONS.\n3.

                GIST IS THAT WE BELIEVE THE US SHOULD TAKE IMMEDIATE STEPS TO ASSIST                            ETHIOPIA IN THE LIGHT OF THE GROWING SOMALI MILITARY THREAT THE MOST                            IMPORTANT OF THESE BEING THE TOTAL ELIMINATION OF THE 3 MILLION                            SHORTFALL IN US MILITARY ASSISTANCE WHICH PRESENTLY APPEARS LIKELY FOR                            FY 73 AND OF ANY PROSPECTIVE SHORTFALL IN FY 742 OVER THE LAST YEAR ETHIOPIAN CONCERN OVER POSSIBLE SOMALI AGGRESSION                            IN THE FUTURE HAS GREATLY INCREASED THE CONSIDERABLY

SIGNIFICANT US MILITARY ASSISTANCE AND A                            KEENER AWARENESS OF THE EMPERORS MORTALITY WITH ALL THAT IMPLIES FOR                            ETHIOPIAS POSSIBLE VULNERABILITY ALL THESE HAVE COMBINED TO HEIGHTEN                            CONCERN CLOSE TO ALARM3 THE MOST OMINIOUS DEVELOPMENT OF ALL HAS BEEN AN APPARENT INCREASE                            SINCE JULY 1 I972 IN THE TEMPO OF SOVIET DELIVERIES OF MILITARY                            EQUIPMENT TO SOMALIA AND IN THE ARRIVAL OF SOVIET MILITARY ADVISORS                            THE FACTS OF WHICH THEY ARE AWARE CONCERN ETHIOPIANS DEEPLY: THEIR                            UNCERTAINTY WHETHER EVEN MORE SIGNIFICANT DELIVERIES HAVE RECENTLY                            OCCURRED OR WILL SHORTLY OCCUR WORRIES THEM EVEN MORE4 ETHIOPIAN MILITARY LEADERS CONSIDER THAT THE PRESENT SOMALI THREAT                            CALLS FOR SUCH MAJOR STRENGTHENING OF ETHIOPIAN FORCES AS A MECHANIZED                            INFANTRY BRIDAGE NUMEROUS ADDITIONAL AIRCRAFT INCREASED AIR DEFENSE                            RADAR COVERAGE AND EIGHT MODERN PATROL CRAFT YET ALTHOUGH NUMEROUS                            ETHIOPIAN LEADERS HAVE OF LATE BEEN EMPHASIZING THEIR CONCERN TO US                            SPECIFIC REQUESTS FOR ADDITIONAL US ASSISTANCE HAVE THUS FAR BEEN                            SURPRISINGLY MODERATE THEY ARE NOT YET AWARE OF THE SHORTFALL IN US                            ASSISTANCE WHICH WE ANTICIPATE IN FY 73 WE BELIEVE THAT MORE                            SUBSTANTIAL REQUESTS ARE LIKELY BEFORE LONG HOWEVER AND WE NOTE IN                            THIS CONNECTION THE FOREIGN MINISTERS RECENT PREDICTION THAT HIS                            GOVERNMENT AND POSSIBLY THE EMPEROR HIMSELF WILL SOON REQUEST A BASIC                            DISCUSSION OF THE SOMALI THREAT WITH THE AMBASSADOR ADDIS 9832 WE                            ALSO BELIEVE THAT ANY HARD INFORMATION REGARDING THE DELIVERY OF MIG21S                            OR T54 TANKS TO SOMALIA WOULD TRIGGER A CONSIDERABLE INCREASE IN THE                            URGENCY AND MAGNITUDE OF ETHIOPIAN REQUESTS5 WE ARE BY NO MEANS INCLINED TO REGARD CURRENT ETHIOPIAN EXPRESSIONS OF                            APPREHENSION AS A PLOY TO IMPRESS THE US WE HAVE NO DOUBT THEY ARE                            SINCERE AND TO A LARGE EXTENT WE CONSIDER THEM JUSTIFIED THERE IS                            SUFFICIENT TERRITORIAL APPETITE AND POLITICAL INSTABILITY IN SOMALIA SO                            THAT THE POSSIBILITY OF A FUTURE DESIRE TO ATTACK ETHIOPIA POSSIBLY IN                            A PERIOD OF CONFUSION FOLLOWING THE EMPERORS DEATH MUST BE TAKEN                            SERIOUSLY THE SOVIETS WILL HOPEFULLY SEEK TO AVERT THIS DANGER BY                            CAREFULLY THROTTLING THEIR DELIVERIES TO SOMALIA BUT WITH THEIR RECORD                            IN THE ARABISRAELI CONFLICT IN MIND WE CANNOT AFFORD TO BE OVERLY                            OPTIMISTIC ON THIS SCORE SOVIET DELIVERIES SINCE JULY 1 1972 HAVE                            NOTICEABLY THOUGH NOT DRASTICALLY STRENGTHENED SOMALI MILITARY                            CAPABILITIES IN OUR JUDGMENT ETHIOPIA HAS GOOD REASON IN CONSEQUENCE TO                            STRENGTHEN ITS MILITARY POSTURE AND SHOULD CERTAINLY SEEK CONSIDERABLE                            STRENGTHENING IF SOMALIA SOON ACQUIRES OR IS FOUND TO HAVE ALREADY                            ACQUIRED SUCH IMPORTANT ADDITIONS AS A SIGNIFICANT QUANTITY OF MIG21S                            AMD T54 TANKS6 IF THE US REACTS TO CURRENT ETHIOPIAN APPREHENSION BY A SIMPLE                            CONTINUATION OF RECENT ATTITUDES AND PROGRAM TRENDS INCLUDING A MAP                            LEVEL OF 91 MILLION 86 MILLION EXLUDING PCHT  PACKAGING CRATING                            HANDLING AND TRANSPORTATION FOR THIS FISCAL YEAR AND PROBABLY FURTHER                            CUTS IN THE NEXT FISCAL YEAR THE IEG WILL CONCLUDE THAT US FRIENDSHIP                            IS OF VERY LIMITED VALUE AND THEIR LEADERS WILL FEEL CONSIDERABLE                            DISILLUSIONMENT AND BITTERNESS WE DO NOT ANTICIPATE THAT THIS WILL                            CAUSE A BASIC CHANGE IN ITS ATTITUDE TOWARDS KAGNEW OR SEVERE DAMAGE TO                            OTHER MAJOR US INTERESTS ALTHOUGH A CAVEAT MUST BE INSERTED THAT A                            TENNECO OIL STRIKE COULD AT ANY TIME ADD AN ADDITIONAL US INTEREST IN                            ETHIOPIA BUT IT WILL PROBABLY MAKE IT SOMEWHAT HARDER FOR THE US TO                            ATTAIN ITS OBJECTIVES WITH REGARD TO A WIDE RANGE OF ISSUES IN                            USETHIOPIAN RELATIONS VIGOROUS ETHIOPIAN EFFORTS TO OBTAIN MILITARY                            EQUIPMENT ON CREDIT FROM OTHER NONCOMMUNIST SOURCES CAN CERTAINLY BE                            ANTICIPATED MANY COUNTRIES WOULD GRADUALLY CONCLUDE THAT US WILLINGNESS                            TO HELP ITS FRIENDS IN TIME OF STRESS HAD REACHED A VERY LOW LEVEL A                            LIBYANARMED ELF MIGHT DECIDE TO ATTACK KAGNEW IF IT SAW CLEARLY HOW                            DISINCLINED THE US WAS TO ASSUME ANY FURTHER INVOLVEMENT IN ETHIOPIA                            LASTLY THERE WOULD SE A SOMEWHAT GREATER DANGER OF SOME FORM OF SOMALI                            AGGRESSION AGAINST EHTHIOPIA THAN IF THE US HAD CONTRIBUTED A LITTLE                            MORE TO ETHIOPIAN STRENGTH7 SHOULD THERE EVENTUALLY BE AN OUTBREAK OF SOME FORM OF HOSTILITIES                            WITH SOMALIA THE DISADVANTAGES FOR THE US MENTIONED IN THE PRECEDING                            PARAGRAPH WOULD SE INTENSIFIED8 THESE CONSEQUENCES OF A SIMPLE CONTINUATION OF RECENT US ATTITUDES AND                            PROGRAM TRENDS ARE SUFFICIENTLY UNPLEASANT IN OUR VIEW TO JUSTIFY A                            THOROUGH SEARCH FOR ADDITIONAL ACTIONS WHICH THE US COULD TAKE AT                            PRESENT TO REASSURE ETHIOPIA TO STRENGTHEN ITS MILITARY CAPABILITIES                            AND TO LESSEN THE LIKELIHOOD OF SOMALI AGGRESSION THE RESULTS OF SUCH                            AN EXAMINATION ON OUR PART ARE SUMMARIZED IN THE FOLLOWING                            PARAGRAPHSA THAT A

              CONTENT OF THE PRESIDENTIAL MEETING DISCUSSED ABOVEC THAT THE US SUGGEST TO THE IEG AND POSSIBLY THE GSDR THAT IT                            CONSIDER APPROACHING THE OAU ANDOR FRIENDLY AFRICAN STATES WITH A                            REQUEST TO MEDIATE THEIR BILATERAL TENSIONS AS WAS DONE IN 1964D THAT A MEETING WITH THE ISRAELIS BE HELD IN WASHINGTON OR JERUSALEM TO EXPLORE POSSIBLE ISRAELI                            ASSISTANCE OF LOW VISIBILITY TO ETHIOPIA INCLUDING THE POSSIBILTIES OF                            TRIANGULAR TRANSACTIONS INVOLVING THE USE THAT THE US CONSULT IN APPROPRIATE CAPITALS WITH THE FRENCH GERMANS                            ITALIANS AND BRITISH TO SHARE ASSESSMENTS OF THE PROBLEM AND TO                            ASCERTAIN WHETHER THEY CAN

                    TO MINIMIZE THE DANGER OF AN ARMS RACE AND FUTURE HOSTILITIESG THAT THE DPARTMENT REVIEW OPTIONS FOR AN IMPROVEMENT IN US RELATIONS                            WITH SOMALIA AND A

SUCH AS AN IMPROVED COMMAND AND                            CONTROL STRUCTURE AND VARIOUS DEPLOYMENT IMPROVEMENTS WHICH IT HAS BEEN                            RECOMMENDING AND WHICH IT WILL CONTINUE TO PROMOTE VIGOROUSLY11 WITH REGARD TO US MILITARY ASSISTANCE A SHORTFALL OF 3 MILLION FROM                            THE DOD MAP OBJECTIVE OF 115 MILLION NOT INCLUDING PCHT NOW APPEARS                            LIKELY FOR FY 73 AND WE SUSPECT THAT THE SHORTFALL FOR FY 74 WILL BE                            EVEN GREATER IF EVENTS ARE ALLOWED TO TAKE THEIR NATURAL COURSE SUCH                            SHORTFALLS COULD PERHAPS HAVE BEEN DIGESTED WITHOUT UNACCEPTABLE DAMAGE                            TO US INTERESTS IF ETHIOPIANSOMALIA RELATIONS WERE NOW APPROXIMATELY                            THE SAME AS WAS THE CASE A YEAR AGO THAT IS DECIDEDLY NOT THE CASE                            UNDER PRESENT CIRCUMSTANCES WE ASCRIBE GREAT IMPORTANCE IN TERMS OF US                            INTERESTS TO THE TOTAL ELMINATION OF THE SHORTFALL THREATENING FOR BOTH                            FY 73 AND FY 74 SUCH ACTION IS NEEDED BOTH IN TERMS OF THE REAL SOMALI                            THREAT AND THE EXPECTATIONS WHICH THE IEG IS ENTITLED TO HAVE REGARDING                            US ASSISTANCE IN TIMES OF GATHERING PERIL ASSISTANCE WHICH WILL MERELY                            PERMIT A STRAIGHTLINE CONTINUATION OF THE MODEST MODERNIZATION PROGRAM                            WHICH BEGAN IN FY 71 WITH FULL US APPROVAL12 WE RECOMMEND THAT IMMEDIATE STEPS BE TAKEN TO ELIMINATE THE IMPENDING 3 MILLION SHORTFALL FOR FY                            73 BY MEANS OF ONE OR MORE OF THE FOLLOWING APPROACHES: A AN INCREASE                            IN MAP B BROADENING THE SPECTRUM OF

THE IEG MILITARY                            EQUIPMENT ON A CREDITSALE BASIS ALTERNATIVE A IS THE MOST DESIRABLE                            IN OUR VIEW BUT WE RECOGNIZE THE INTENSE WORLDWIDE DEMANDS UPON A                            SHRINKING MAP BUDGET ALTERNATIVE B SHOULD BE FEASIBLE WITHOUT MUCH                            DIFFICULTY IN OUR VIEW TO A LEVEL OF ABOUT 900000 THIS YEAR AN                            INCREASE OF UP TO 2 MILLION IN FY 73 WOULD IN FACT BE POSSIBLE FROM THE                            STANDPOINT OF ETHIOPIAS ABSORPTIVE CAPACITIES BUT POSSIBLE                            CONGRESSIONAL REACTION IN THE LIGHT OF THE PURPOSE OF SECTION 620 S OF                            THE FOREIGN ASSISTANCE ACT WOULD NEED TO BE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT AS WELL                            AS

ALTERNATIVES14 THE US ASSISTANCE RECOMMENDED IN PARAS 12 AND 13 SHOULD PROVIDE                            SUFFICIENT ETHIOPIAN MILITARY STRENGTH TO BALANCE THE SOMALI THREAT AS                            WE NOW PERCEIVE IT WE FEEL COMPELLED TO EMPHASIZE HOWEVER THAT SHOULD                            THERE BE A MAJOR STRENGTHENING OF SOMALI MILITARY CAPABILITIES SUCH AS                            WOULD LATER RESULT FROM DELIVERIES OF SIGNIFICANT NUMBERS OF MIG21S AND                            T54 TANKS WE WILL OBVIOUSLY NEED TO REASSESS THE PROBLEM15 SOME PARTS OF THIS TELEGRAM MAY APPEAR TO

CASE WE RECOGNIZE THAT IF THE SOMALI THREAT                            SHOULD INCREASE RAPIDLY AND CONTINUALLY IN THE FUTURE THERE WOULD COME A                            TIME WHEN THE US WOULD HAVE TO DRAW THE LINE SHORT OF INCREASED MILITARY                            ASSISTANCE AND LEAVE THE SOVIETS TO BEAR THE ONUS OF SUBSEQUENT                            CONSEQUENCES IN OUR VIEW HOWEVER NOW IS DECIDEDLY NOT THE TIME TO                            DRAW SUCH A LINE THERE IS STILL AMPLE REASON TO HOPE THAT A                            CONTINUATION OF OUR ORIGINAL PLANS FOR MILITARY ASSISTANCE TO ETHIOPIA                            COMBINED WITH A SETTING BY THE SOVIETS OF REASONABLE LIMITS ON THEIR                            ASSISTANCE TO SOMALIA WILL EFFECTIVELY PROTECT US

                GIST IS THAT WE BELIEVE THE US SHOULD TAKE IMMEDIATE STEPS TO ASSIST                            ETHIOPIA IN THE LIGHT OF THE GROWING SOMALI MILITARY THREAT THE MOST                            IMPORTANT OF THESE BEING THE TOTAL ELIMINATION OF THE 3 MILLION                            SHORTFALL IN US MILITARY ASSISTANCE WHICH PRESENTLY APPEARS LIKELY FOR                            FY 73 AND OF ANY PROSPECTIVE SHORTFALL IN FY 742 OVER THE LAST YEAR ETHIOPIAN CONCERN OVER POSSIBLE SOMALI AGGRESSION                            IN THE FUTURE HAS GREATLY INCREASED THE CONSIDERABLY

SIGNIFICANT US MILITARY ASSISTANCE AND A                            KEENER AWARENESS OF THE EMPERORS MORTALITY WITH ALL THAT IMPLIES FOR                            ETHIOPIAS POSSIBLE VULNERABILITY ALL THESE HAVE COMBINED TO HEIGHTEN                            CONCERN CLOSE TO ALARM3 THE MOST OMINIOUS DEVELOPMENT OF ALL HAS BEEN AN APPARENT INCREASE                            SINCE JULY 1 I972 IN THE TEMPO OF SOVIET DELIVERIES OF MILITARY                            EQUIPMENT TO SOMALIA AND IN THE ARRIVAL OF SOVIET MILITARY ADVISORS                            THE FACTS OF WHICH THEY ARE AWARE CONCERN ETHIOPIANS DEEPLY: THEIR                            UNCERTAINTY WHETHER EVEN MORE SIGNIFICANT DELIVERIES HAVE RECENTLY                            OCCURRED OR WILL SHORTLY OCCUR WORRIES THEM EVEN MORE4 ETHIOPIAN MILITARY LEADERS CONSIDER THAT THE PRESENT SOMALI THREAT                            CALLS FOR SUCH MAJOR STRENGTHENING OF ETHIOPIAN FORCES AS A MECHANIZED                            INFANTRY BRIDAGE NUMEROUS ADDITIONAL AIRCRAFT INCREASED AIR DEFENSE                            RADAR COVERAGE AND EIGHT MODERN PATROL CRAFT YET ALTHOUGH NUMEROUS                            ETHIOPIAN LEADERS HAVE OF LATE BEEN EMPHASIZING THEIR CONCERN TO US                            SPECIFIC REQUESTS FOR ADDITIONAL US ASSISTANCE HAVE THUS FAR BEEN                            SURPRISINGLY MODERATE THEY ARE NOT YET AWARE OF THE SHORTFALL IN US                            ASSISTANCE WHICH WE ANTICIPATE IN FY 73 WE BELIEVE THAT MORE                            SUBSTANTIAL REQUESTS ARE LIKELY BEFORE LONG HOWEVER AND WE NOTE IN                            THIS CONNECTION THE FOREIGN MINISTERS RECENT PREDICTION THAT HIS                            GOVERNMENT AND POSSIBLY THE EMPEROR HIMSELF WILL SOON REQUEST A BASIC                            DISCUSSION OF THE SOMALI THREAT WITH THE AMBASSADOR ADDIS 9832 WE                            ALSO BELIEVE THAT ANY HARD INFORMATION REGARDING THE DELIVERY OF MIG21S                            OR T54 TANKS TO SOMALIA WOULD TRIGGER A CONSIDERABLE INCREASE IN THE                            URGENCY AND MAGNITUDE OF ETHIOPIAN REQUESTS5 WE ARE BY NO MEANS INCLINED TO REGARD CURRENT ETHIOPIAN EXPRESSIONS OF                            APPREHENSION AS A PLOY TO IMPRESS THE US WE HAVE NO DOUBT THEY ARE                            SINCERE AND TO A LARGE EXTENT WE CONSIDER THEM JUSTIFIED THERE IS                            SUFFICIENT TERRITORIAL APPETITE AND POLITICAL INSTABILITY IN SOMALIA SO                            THAT THE POSSIBILITY OF A FUTURE DESIRE TO ATTACK ETHIOPIA POSSIBLY IN                            A PERIOD OF CONFUSION FOLLOWING THE EMPERORS DEATH MUST BE TAKEN                            SERIOUSLY THE SOVIETS WILL HOPEFULLY SEEK TO AVERT THIS DANGER BY                            CAREFULLY THROTTLING THEIR DELIVERIES TO SOMALIA BUT WITH THEIR RECORD                            IN THE ARABISRAELI CONFLICT IN MIND WE CANNOT AFFORD TO BE OVERLY                            OPTIMISTIC ON THIS SCORE SOVIET DELIVERIES SINCE JULY 1 1972 HAVE                            NOTICEABLY THOUGH NOT DRASTICALLY STRENGTHENED SOMALI MILITARY                            CAPABILITIES IN OUR JUDGMENT ETHIOPIA HAS GOOD REASON IN CONSEQUENCE TO                            STRENGTHEN ITS MILITARY POSTURE AND SHOULD CERTAINLY SEEK CONSIDERABLE                            STRENGTHENING IF SOMALIA SOON ACQUIRES OR IS FOUND TO HAVE ALREADY                            ACQUIRED SUCH IMPORTANT ADDITIONS AS A SIGNIFICANT QUANTITY OF MIG21S                            AMD T54 TANKS6 IF THE US REACTS TO CURRENT ETHIOPIAN APPREHENSION BY A SIMPLE                            CONTINUATION OF RECENT ATTITUDES AND PROGRAM TRENDS INCLUDING A MAP                            LEVEL OF 91 MILLION 86 MILLION EXLUDING PCHT  PACKAGING CRATING                            HANDLING AND TRANSPORTATION FOR THIS FISCAL YEAR AND PROBABLY FURTHER                            CUTS IN THE NEXT FISCAL YEAR THE IEG WILL CONCLUDE THAT US FRIENDSHIP                            IS OF VERY LIMITED VALUE AND THEIR LEADERS WILL FEEL CONSIDERABLE                            DISILLUSIONMENT AND BITTERNESS WE DO NOT ANTICIPATE THAT THIS WILL                            CAUSE A BASIC CHANGE IN ITS ATTITUDE TOWARDS KAGNEW OR SEVERE DAMAGE TO                            OTHER MAJOR US INTERESTS ALTHOUGH A CAVEAT MUST BE INSERTED THAT A                            TENNECO OIL STRIKE COULD AT ANY TIME ADD AN ADDITIONAL US INTEREST IN                            ETHIOPIA BUT IT WILL PROBABLY MAKE IT SOMEWHAT HARDER FOR THE US TO                            ATTAIN ITS OBJECTIVES WITH REGARD TO A WIDE RANGE OF ISSUES IN                            USETHIOPIAN RELATIONS VIGOROUS ETHIOPIAN EFFORTS TO OBTAIN MILITARY                            EQUIPMENT ON CREDIT FROM OTHER NONCOMMUNIST SOURCES CAN CERTAINLY BE                            ANTICIPATED MANY COUNTRIES WOULD GRADUALLY CONCLUDE THAT US WILLINGNESS                            TO HELP ITS FRIENDS IN TIME OF STRESS HAD REACHED A VERY LOW LEVEL A                            LIBYANARMED ELF MIGHT DECIDE TO ATTACK KAGNEW IF IT SAW CLEARLY HOW                            DISINCLINED THE US WAS TO ASSUME ANY FURTHER INVOLVEMENT IN ETHIOPIA                            LASTLY THERE WOULD SE A SOMEWHAT GREATER DANGER OF SOME FORM OF SOMALI                            AGGRESSION AGAINST EHTHIOPIA THAN IF THE US HAD CONTRIBUTED A LITTLE                            MORE TO ETHIOPIAN STRENGTH7 SHOULD THERE EVENTUALLY BE AN OUTBREAK OF SOME FORM OF HOSTILITIES                            WITH SOMALIA THE DISADVANTAGES FOR THE US MENTIONED IN THE PRECEDING                            PARAGRAPH WOULD SE INTENSIFIED8 THESE CONSEQUENCES OF A SIMPLE CONTINUATION OF RECENT US ATTITUDES AND                            PROGRAM TRENDS ARE SUFFICIENTLY UNPLEASANT IN OUR VIEW TO JUSTIFY A                            THOROUGH SEARCH FOR ADDITIONAL ACTIONS WHICH THE US COULD TAKE AT                            PRESENT TO REASSURE ETHIOPIA TO STRENGTHEN ITS MILITARY CAPABILITIES                            AND TO LESSEN THE LIKELIHOOD OF SOMALI AGGRESSION THE RESULTS OF SUCH                            AN EXAMINATION ON OUR PART ARE SUMMARIZED IN THE FOLLOWING                            PARAGRAPHSA THAT A

              CONTENT OF THE PRESIDENTIAL MEETING DISCUSSED ABOVEC THAT THE US SUGGEST TO THE IEG AND POSSIBLY THE GSDR THAT IT                            CONSIDER APPROACHING THE OAU ANDOR FRIENDLY AFRICAN STATES WITH A                            REQUEST TO MEDIATE THEIR BILATERAL TENSIONS AS WAS DONE IN 1964D THAT A MEETING WITH THE ISRAELIS BE HELD IN WASHINGTON OR JERUSALEM TO EXPLORE POSSIBLE ISRAELI                            ASSISTANCE OF LOW VISIBILITY TO ETHIOPIA INCLUDING THE POSSIBILTIES OF                            TRIANGULAR TRANSACTIONS INVOLVING THE USE THAT THE US CONSULT IN APPROPRIATE CAPITALS WITH THE FRENCH GERMANS                            ITALIANS AND BRITISH TO SHARE ASSESSMENTS OF THE PROBLEM AND TO                            ASCERTAIN WHETHER THEY CAN MAKE USEFUL CONTRIBUTIONSF THAT THE DEPARTMENT CONSIDER THE DESIRABILITY OF A HIGHLEVEL APPROCH                            TO APPRISE THE SOVIETS OF OUR CONCERN AND TO REQUEST THEIR COOPERATION                            TO MINIMIZE THE DANGER OF AN ARMS RACE AND FUTURE HOSTILITIESG THAT THE DPARTMENT REVIEW OPTIONS FOR AN IMPROVEMENT IN US RELATIONS                            WITH SOMALIA AND A

SUCH AS AN IMPROVED COMMAND AND                            CONTROL STRUCTURE AND VARIOUS DEPLOYMENT IMPROVEMENTS WHICH IT HAS BEEN                            RECOMMENDING AND WHICH IT WILL CONTINUE TO PROMOTE VIGOROUSLY11 WITH REGARD TO US MILITARY ASSISTANCE A SHORTFALL OF 3 MILLION FROM                            THE DOD MAP OBJECTIVE OF 115 MILLION NOT INCLUDING PCHT NOW APPEARS                            LIKELY FOR FY 73 AND WE SUSPECT THAT THE SHORTFALL FOR FY 74 WILL BE                            EVEN GREATER IF EVENTS ARE ALLOWED TO TAKE THEIR NATURAL COURSE SUCH                            SHORTFALLS COULD PERHAPS HAVE BEEN DIGESTED WITHOUT UNACCEPTABLE DAMAGE                            TO US INTERESTS IF ETHIOPIANSOMALIA RELATIONS WERE NOW APPROXIMATELY                            THE SAME AS WAS THE CASE A YEAR AGO THAT IS DECIDEDLY NOT THE CASE                            UNDER PRESENT CIRCUMSTANCES WE ASCRIBE GREAT IMPORTANCE IN TERMS OF US                            INTERESTS TO THE TOTAL ELMINATION OF THE SHORTFALL THREATENING FOR BOTH                            FY 73 AND FY 74 SUCH ACTION IS NEEDED BOTH IN TERMS OF THE REAL SOMALI                            THREAT AND THE EXPECTATIONS WHICH THE IEG IS ENTITLED TO HAVE REGARDING                            US ASSISTANCE IN TIMES OF GATHERING PERIL ASSISTANCE WHICH WILL MERELY                            PERMIT A STRAIGHTLINE CONTINUATION OF THE MODEST MODERNIZATION PROGRAM                            WHICH BEGAN IN FY 71 WITH FULL US APPROVAL12 WE RECOMMEND THAT IMMEDIATE STEPS BE TAKEN TO ELIMINATE THE IMPENDING 3 MILLION SHORTFALL FOR FY                            73 BY MEANS OF ONE OR MORE OF THE FOLLOWING APPROACHES: A AN INCREASE                            IN MAP B BROADENING THE SPECTRUM OF ELIGIBLE EXPENDITURES FOR THE                            EXISTING AID AGRICULTURAL SECTOR LOAN TO PERMIT AN IEG SHIFT OF BUDGET                            RESOURCES TO DEFENSE SUPPORT AND C OFFERING THE IEG MILITARY                            EQUIPMENT ON A CREDITSALE BASIS ALTERNATIVE A IS THE MOST DESIRABLE                            IN OUR VIEW BUT WE RECOGNIZE THE INTENSE WORLDWIDE DEMANDS UPON A                            SHRINKING MAP BUDGET ALTERNATIVE B SHOULD BE FEASIBLE WITHOUT MUCH                            DIFFICULTY IN OUR VIEW TO A LEVEL OF ABOUT 900000 THIS YEAR AN                            INCREASE OF UP TO 2 MILLION IN FY 73 WOULD IN FACT BE POSSIBLE FROM THE                            STANDPOINT OF ETHIOPIAS ABSORPTIVE CAPACITIES BUT POSSIBLE                            CONGRESSIONAL REACTION IN THE LIGHT OF THE PURPOSE OF SECTION 620 S OF                            THE FOREIGN ASSISTANCE ACT WOULD NEED TO BE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT AS WELL                            AS

                GIST IS THAT WE BELIEVE THE US SHOULD TAKE IMMEDIATE STEPS TO ASSIST                            ETHIOPIA IN THE LIGHT OF THE GROWING SOMALI MILITARY THREAT THE MOST                            IMPORTANT OF THESE BEING THE TOTAL ELIMINATION OF THE 3 MILLION                            SHORTFALL IN US MILITARY ASSISTANCE WHICH PRESENTLY APPEARS LIKELY FOR                            FY 73 AND OF ANY PROSPECTIVE SHORTFALL IN FY 742 OVER THE LAST YEAR ETHIOPIAN CONCERN OVER POSSIBLE SOMALI AGGRESSION                            IN THE FUTURE HAS GREATLY INCREASED THE CONSIDERABLY

SIGNIFICANT US MILITARY ASSISTANCE AND A                            KEENER AWARENESS OF THE EMPERORS MORTALITY WITH ALL THAT IMPLIES FOR                            ETHIOPIAS POSSIBLE VULNERABILITY ALL THESE HAVE COMBINED TO HEIGHTEN                            CONCERN CLOSE TO ALARM3 THE MOST OMINIOUS DEVELOPMENT OF ALL HAS BEEN AN APPARENT INCREASE                            SINCE JULY 1 I972 IN THE TEMPO OF SOVIET DELIVERIES OF MILITARY                            EQUIPMENT TO SOMALIA AND IN THE ARRIVAL OF SOVIET MILITARY ADVISORS                            THE FACTS OF WHICH THEY ARE AWARE CONCERN ETHIOPIANS DEEPLY: THEIR                            UNCERTAINTY WHETHER EVEN MORE SIGNIFICANT DELIVERIES HAVE RECENTLY                            OCCURRED OR WILL SHORTLY OCCUR WORRIES THEM EVEN MORE4 ETHIOPIAN MILITARY LEADERS CONSIDER THAT THE PRESENT SOMALI THREAT                            CALLS FOR SUCH MAJOR STRENGTHENING OF ETHIOPIAN FORCES AS A MECHANIZED                            INFANTRY BRIDAGE NUMEROUS ADDITIONAL AIRCRAFT INCREASED AIR DEFENSE                            RADAR COVERAGE AND EIGHT MODERN PATROL CRAFT YET ALTHOUGH NUMEROUS                            ETHIOPIAN LEADERS HAVE OF LATE BEEN EMPHASIZING THEIR CONCERN TO US                            SPECIFIC REQUESTS FOR ADDITIONAL US ASSISTANCE HAVE THUS FAR BEEN                            SURPRISINGLY MODERATE THEY ARE NOT YET AWARE OF THE SHORTFALL IN US                            ASSISTANCE WHICH WE ANTICIPATE IN FY 73 WE BELIEVE THAT MORE                            SUBSTANTIAL REQUESTS ARE LIKELY BEFORE LONG HOWEVER AND WE NOTE IN                            THIS CONNECTION THE FOREIGN MINISTERS RECENT PREDICTION THAT HIS                            GOVERNMENT AND POSSIBLY THE EMPEROR HIMSELF WILL SOON REQUEST A BASIC                            DISCUSSION OF THE SOMALI THREAT WITH THE AMBASSADOR ADDIS 9832 WE                            ALSO BELIEVE THAT ANY HARD INFORMATION REGARDING THE DELIVERY OF MIG21S                            OR T54 TANKS TO SOMALIA WOULD TRIGGER A CONSIDERABLE INCREASE IN THE                            URGENCY AND MAGNITUDE OF ETHIOPIAN REQUESTS5 WE ARE BY NO MEANS INCLINED TO REGARD CURRENT ETHIOPIAN EXPRESSIONS OF                            APPREHENSION AS A PLOY TO IMPRESS THE US WE HAVE NO DOUBT THEY ARE                            SINCERE AND TO A LARGE EXTENT WE CONSIDER THEM JUSTIFIED THERE IS                            SUFFICIENT TERRITORIAL APPETITE AND POLITICAL INSTABILITY IN SOMALIA SO                            THAT THE POSSIBILITY OF A FUTURE DESIRE TO ATTACK ETHIOPIA POSSIBLY IN                            A PERIOD OF CONFUSION FOLLOWING THE EMPERORS DEATH MUST BE TAKEN                            SERIOUSLY THE SOVIETS WILL HOPEFULLY SEEK TO AVERT THIS DANGER BY                            CAREFULLY THROTTLING THEIR DELIVERIES TO SOMALIA BUT WITH THEIR RECORD                            IN THE ARABISRAELI CONFLICT IN MIND WE CANNOT AFFORD TO BE OVERLY                            OPTIMISTIC ON THIS SCORE SOVIET DELIVERIES SINCE JULY 1 1972 HAVE                            NOTICEABLY THOUGH NOT DRASTICALLY STRENGTHENED SOMALI MILITARY                            CAPABILITIES IN OUR JUDGMENT ETHIOPIA HAS GOOD REASON IN CONSEQUENCE TO                            STRENGTHEN ITS MILITARY POSTURE AND SHOULD CERTAINLY SEEK CONSIDERABLE                            STRENGTHENING IF SOMALIA SOON ACQUIRES OR IS FOUND TO HAVE ALREADY                            ACQUIRED SUCH IMPORTANT ADDITIONS AS A SIGNIFICANT QUANTITY OF MIG21S                            AMD T54 TANKS6 IF THE US REACTS TO CURRENT ETHIOPIAN APPREHENSION BY A SIMPLE                            CONTINUATION OF RECENT ATTITUDES AND PROGRAM TRENDS INCLUDING

                    CUTS IN THE NEXT FISCAL YEAR THE IEG WILL CONCLUDE THAT US FRIENDSHIP                            IS OF VERY LIMITED VALUE AND THEIR LEADERS WILL FEEL CONSIDERABLE                            DISILLUSIONMENT AND BITTERNESS WE DO NOT ANTICIPATE THAT THIS WILL                            CAUSE A BASIC CHANGE IN ITS ATTITUDE TOWARDS KAGNEW OR SEVERE DAMAGE TO                            OTHER MAJOR US INTERESTS ALTHOUGH A CAVEAT MUST BE INSERTED THAT A                            TENNECO OIL STRIKE COULD AT ANY TIME ADD AN ADDITIONAL US INTEREST IN                            ETHIOPIA BUT IT WILL PROBABLY MAKE IT SOMEWHAT HARDER FOR THE US TO                            ATTAIN ITS OBJECTIVES WITH REGARD TO A WIDE RANGE OF ISSUES IN                            USETHIOPIAN RELATIONS VIGOROUS ETHIOPIAN EFFORTS TO OBTAIN MILITARY                            EQUIPMENT ON CREDIT FROM OTHER NONCOMMUNIST SOURCES CAN CERTAINLY BE                            ANTICIPATED MANY COUNTRIES WOULD GRADUALLY CONCLUDE THAT US WILLINGNESS                            TO HELP ITS FRIENDS IN TIME OF STRESS HAD REACHED A VERY LOW LEVEL A                            LIBYANARMED ELF MIGHT DECIDE TO ATTACK KAGNEW IF IT SAW CLEARLY HOW                            DISINCLINED THE US WAS TO ASSUME ANY FURTHER INVOLVEMENT IN ETHIOPIA                            LASTLY THERE WOULD SE A SOMEWHAT GREATER DANGER OF SOME FORM OF SOMALI                            AGGRESSION AGAINST EHTHIOPIA THAN IF THE US HAD CONTRIBUTED A LITTLE                            MORE TO ETHIOPIAN STRENGTH7 SHOULD THERE EVENTUALLY BE AN OUTBREAK OF SOME FORM OF HOSTILITIES                            WITH SOMALIA THE DISADVANTAGES FOR THE US MENTIONED IN THE PRECEDING                            PARAGRAPH WOULD SE INTENSIFIED8 THESE CONSEQUENCES OF A SIMPLE CONTINUATION OF RECENT US ATTITUDES AND                            PROGRAM TRENDS ARE SUFFICIENTLY UNPLEASANT IN OUR VIEW TO JUSTIFY A                            THOROUGH SEARCH FOR ADDITIONAL ACTIONS WHICH THE US COULD TAKE AT                            PRESENT TO REASSURE ETHIOPIA TO STRENGTHEN ITS MILITARY CAPABILITIES                            AND TO LESSEN THE LIKELIHOOD OF SOMALI AGGRESSION THE RESULTS OF SUCH                            AN EXAMINATION ON OUR PART ARE SUMMARIZED IN THE FOLLOWING                            PARAGRAPHSA THAT A

PROMOTE VIGOROUSLY11 WITH REGARD TO US MILITARY ASSISTANCE A SHORTFALL OF 3 MILLION FROM                            THE DOD MAP OBJECTIVE OF 115 MILLION NOT INCLUDING PCHT NOW APPEARS                            LIKELY FOR FY 73 AND WE SUSPECT THAT THE SHORTFALL FOR FY 74 WILL BE                            EVEN GREATER IF EVENTS ARE ALLOWED TO TAKE THEIR NATURAL COURSE SUCH                            SHORTFALLS COULD PERHAPS HAVE BEEN DIGESTED WITHOUT UNACCEPTABLE DAMAGE                            TO US INTERESTS IF ETHIOPIANSOMALIA RELATIONS WERE NOW APPROXIMATELY                            THE SAME AS WAS THE CASE A YEAR AGO THAT IS DECIDEDLY NOT THE CASE                            UNDER PRESENT CIRCUMSTANCES WE ASCRIBE GREAT IMPORTANCE IN TERMS OF US                            INTERESTS TO THE TOTAL ELMINATION OF THE SHORTFALL THREATENING FOR BOTH                            FY 73 AND FY 74 SUCH ACTION IS NEEDED BOTH IN TERMS OF THE REAL SOMALI                            THREAT AND THE EXPECTATIONS WHICH THE IEG IS ENTITLED TO HAVE REGARDING                            US ASSISTANCE IN TIMES OF GATHERING PERIL ASSISTANCE WHICH WILL MERELY                            PERMIT A STRAIGHTLINE CONTINUATION OF THE MODEST MODERNIZATION PROGRAM                            WHICH BEGAN IN FY 71 WITH FULL US APPROVAL12 WE RECOMMEND THAT IMMEDIATE STEPS BE TAKEN TO ELIMINATE THE IMPENDING 3 MILLION SHORTFALL FOR FY                            73 BY MEANS OF ONE OR MORE OF THE FOLLOWING APPROACHES: A AN INCREASE                            IN MAP B BROADENING THE SPECTRUM OF

UPON A                            SHRINKING MAP BUDGET ALTERNATIVE B SHOULD BE FEASIBLE WITHOUT MUCH                            DIFFICULTY IN OUR VIEW TO A LEVEL OF ABOUT 900000 THIS YEAR AN                            INCREASE OF UP TO 2 MILLION IN FY 73 WOULD IN FACT BE POSSIBLE FROM THE                            STANDPOINT OF ETHIOPIAS ABSORPTIVE CAPACITIES BUT POSSIBLE

SUGGEST THAT WE HAVE IN MIND THE POSSIBILITY OF AN                            INDEFINITELY CONTINUING DRASTIC ESCALATION OF US ASSISTANCE IN FUTURE                            YEARS THAT IS NOT THE CASE WE RECOGNIZE THAT IF THE SOMALI THREAT                            SHOULD INCREASE RAPIDLY AND CONTINUALLY IN THE FUTURE THERE WOULD COME A                            TIME WHEN THE US WOULD HAVE TO DRAW THE LINE SHORT OF INCREASED MILITARY                            ASSISTANCE AND LEAVE THE SOVIETS TO BEAR THE ONUS OF SUBSEQUENT                            CONSEQUENCES IN OUR VIEW HOWEVER NOW IS DECIDEDLY NOT THE TIME TO                            DRAW SUCH A LINE THERE IS STILL AMPLE REASON TO HOPE THAT A                            CONTINUATION OF OUR ORIGINAL PLANS FOR MILITARY ASSISTANCE TO ETHIOPIA                            COMBINED WITH A SETTING BY THE SOVIETS OF REASONABLE LIMITS ON THEIR                            ASSISTANCE TO SOMALIA WILL EFFECTIVELY PROTECT US

                GIST IS THAT WE BELIEVE THE US SHOULD TAKE IMMEDIATE STEPS TO ASSIST                            ETHIOPIA IN THE LIGHT OF THE GROWING SOMALI MILITARY THREAT THE MOST                            IMPORTANT OF THESE BEING THE TOTAL ELIMINATION OF THE 3 MILLION                            SHORTFALL IN US MILITARY ASSISTANCE WHICH PRESENTLY APPEARS LIKELY FOR                            FY 73 AND OF ANY PROSPECTIVE SHORTFALL IN FY 742 OVER THE LAST YEAR ETHIOPIAN CONCERN OVER POSSIBLE SOMALI AGGRESSION                            IN THE FUTURE HAS GREATLY INCREASED THE CONSIDERABLY

THESE HAVE COMBINED TO HEIGHTEN                            CONCERN CLOSE TO ALARM3 THE MOST OMINIOUS DEVELOPMENT OF ALL HAS BEEN AN APPARENT INCREASE                            SINCE JULY 1 I972 IN THE TEMPO OF SOVIET DELIVERIES OF MILITARY                            EQUIPMENT TO SOMALIA AND IN THE ARRIVAL OF SOVIET MILITARY ADVISORS                            THE FACTS OF WHICH THEY ARE AWARE CONCERN ETHIOPIANS DEEPLY: THEIR                            UNCERTAINTY WHETHER EVEN MORE SIGNIFICANT DELIVERIES HAVE RECENTLY                            OCCURRED OR WILL SHORTLY OCCUR WORRIES THEM EVEN MORE4 ETHIOPIAN MILITARY LEADERS CONSIDER THAT THE PRESENT SOMALI THREAT                            CALLS FOR SUCH MAJOR STRENGTHENING OF ETHIOPIAN FORCES AS A MECHANIZED                            INFANTRY BRIDAGE NUMEROUS ADDITIONAL AIRCRAFT INCREASED AIR DEFENSE                            RADAR COVERAGE AND EIGHT MODERN PATROL CRAFT YET ALTHOUGH NUMEROUS                            ETHIOPIAN LEADERS HAVE OF LATE BEEN EMPHASIZING THEIR CONCERN TO US                            SPECIFIC REQUESTS FOR ADDITIONAL US ASSISTANCE HAVE THUS FAR BEEN                            SURPRISINGLY MODERATE THEY ARE NOT YET AWARE OF THE SHORTFALL IN US                            ASSISTANCE WHICH WE ANTICIPATE IN FY 73 WE BELIEVE THAT MORE                            SUBSTANTIAL REQUESTS ARE LIKELY BEFORE LONG HOWEVER AND WE NOTE IN                            THIS CONNECTION THE FOREIGN MINISTERS RECENT PREDICTION THAT HIS                            GOVERNMENT AND POSSIBLY THE EMPEROR HIMSELF WILL SOON REQUEST A BASIC                            DISCUSSION OF THE SOMALI THREAT WITH THE AMBASSADOR ADDIS 9832 WE                            ALSO BELIEVE THAT ANY HARD INFORMATION REGARDING THE DELIVERY OF MIG21S                            OR T54 TANKS TO SOMALIA WOULD TRIGGER A CONSIDERABLE INCREASE IN THE                            URGENCY AND MAGNITUDE OF ETHIOPIAN REQUESTS5 WE ARE BY NO MEANS INCLINED TO REGARD CURRENT ETHIOPIAN EXPRESSIONS OF                            APPREHENSION AS A PLOY TO IMPRESS THE US WE HAVE NO DOUBT THEY ARE                            SINCERE AND TO A LARGE EXTENT WE CONSIDER THEM JUSTIFIED THERE IS                            SUFFICIENT TERRITORIAL APPETITE AND POLITICAL INSTABILITY IN SOMALIA SO                            THAT THE POSSIBILITY OF A FUTURE DESIRE TO ATTACK ETHIOPIA POSSIBLY IN                            A PERIOD OF CONFUSION FOLLOWING THE EMPERORS DEATH MUST BE TAKEN                            SERIOUSLY THE SOVIETS WILL HOPEFULLY SEEK TO AVERT THIS DANGER BY                            CAREFULLY THROTTLING THEIR DELIVERIES TO SOMALIA BUT WITH THEIR RECORD                            IN THE ARABISRAELI CONFLICT IN MIND WE CANNOT AFFORD TO BE OVERLY                            OPTIMISTIC ON THIS SCORE SOVIET DELIVERIES SINCE JULY 1 1972 HAVE                            NOTICEABLY THOUGH NOT DRASTICALLY STRENGTHENED SOMALI MILITARY                            CAPABILITIES IN OUR JUDGMENT ETHIOPIA HAS GOOD REASON IN CONSEQUENCE TO                            STRENGTHEN ITS MILITARY POSTURE AND SHOULD CERTAINLY SEEK CONSIDERABLE                            STRENGTHENING IF SOMALIA SOON ACQUIRES OR IS FOUND TO HAVE ALREADY                            ACQUIRED SUCH IMPORTANT ADDITIONS AS A SIGNIFICANT QUANTITY OF MIG21S                            AMD T54 TANKS6 IF THE US REACTS TO CURRENT ETHIOPIAN APPREHENSION BY A SIMPLE                            CONTINUATION OF RECENT ATTITUDES AND PROGRAM TRENDS INCLUDING A MAP                            LEVEL OF 91 MILLION 86 MILLION EXLUDING PCHT  PACKAGING CRATING                            HANDLING AND TRANSPORTATION FOR THIS FISCAL YEAR AND PROBABLY FURTHER                            CUTS IN THE NEXT FISCAL YEAR THE IEG WILL CONCLUDE THAT US FRIENDSHIP                            IS OF VERY LIMITED VALUE AND THEIR LEADERS WILL FEEL CONSIDERABLE                            DISILLUSIONMENT AND BITTERNESS WE DO NOT ANTICIPATE THAT THIS WILL                            CAUSE A BASIC CHANGE IN ITS ATTITUDE TOWARDS KAGNEW OR SEVERE DAMAGE TO                            OTHER MAJOR US INTERESTS ALTHOUGH A CAVEAT MUST BE INSERTED THAT A                            TENNECO OIL STRIKE COULD AT ANY TIME ADD AN ADDITIONAL US INTEREST IN                            ETHIOPIA BUT IT WILL PROBABLY MAKE IT SOMEWHAT HARDER FOR THE US TO                            ATTAIN ITS OBJECTIVES WITH REGARD TO A WIDE RANGE OF ISSUES IN                            USETHIOPIAN RELATIONS VIGOROUS ETHIOPIAN EFFORTS TO OBTAIN MILITARY                            EQUIPMENT ON CREDIT FROM OTHER NONCOMMUNIST SOURCES CAN CERTAINLY BE                            ANTICIPATED MANY COUNTRIES WOULD GRADUALLY CONCLUDE THAT US WILLINGNESS                            TO HELP ITS FRIENDS IN TIME OF STRESS HAD REACHED A VERY LOW LEVEL A                            LIBYANARMED ELF MIGHT DECIDE TO ATTACK KAGNEW IF IT SAW CLEARLY HOW                            DISINCLINED THE US WAS TO ASSUME ANY FURTHER INVOLVEMENT IN ETHIOPIA                            LASTLY THERE WOULD SE A SOMEWHAT GREATER DANGER OF SOME FORM OF SOMALI                            AGGRESSION AGAINST EHTHIOPIA THAN IF THE US HAD CONTRIBUTED A LITTLE                            MORE TO ETHIOPIAN STRENGTH7 SHOULD THERE EVENTUALLY BE AN OUTBREAK OF SOME FORM OF HOSTILITIES                            WITH SOMALIA THE DISADVANTAGES FOR THE US MENTIONED IN THE PRECEDING                            PARAGRAPH WOULD SE INTENSIFIED8 THESE CONSEQUENCES OF A SIMPLE CONTINUATION OF RECENT US ATTITUDES AND                            PROGRAM TRENDS ARE SUFFICIENTLY UNPLEASANT IN OUR VIEW TO JUSTIFY A                            THOROUGH SEARCH FOR ADDITIONAL ACTIONS WHICH THE US COULD TAKE AT                            PRESENT TO REASSURE ETHIOPIA TO STRENGTHEN ITS MILITARY CAPABILITIES                            AND TO LESSEN THE LIKELIHOOD OF SOMALI AGGRESSION THE RESULTS OF SUCH                            AN EXAMINATION ON OUR PART ARE SUMMARIZED IN THE FOLLOWING                            PARAGRAPHSA THAT A

PROMOTE VIGOROUSLY11 WITH REGARD TO US MILITARY ASSISTANCE A SHORTFALL OF 3 MILLION FROM                            THE DOD MAP OBJECTIVE OF 115 MILLION NOT INCLUDING PCHT NOW APPEARS                            LIKELY FOR FY 73 AND WE SUSPECT THAT THE SHORTFALL FOR FY 74 WILL BE                            EVEN GREATER IF EVENTS ARE ALLOWED TO TAKE THEIR NATURAL COURSE SUCH

SAME AS WAS THE CASE A YEAR AGO THAT IS DECIDEDLY NOT THE CASE                            UNDER PRESENT CIRCUMSTANCES WE ASCRIBE GREAT IMPORTANCE IN TERMS OF US                            INTERESTS TO THE TOTAL ELMINATION OF THE SHORTFALL THREATENING FOR BOTH                            FY 73 AND FY 74 SUCH ACTION IS NEEDED BOTH IN TERMS OF THE REAL SOMALI                            THREAT AND THE

STRAIGHTLINE CONTINUATION OF THE MODEST MODERNIZATION PROGRAM                            WHICH BEGAN IN FY 71 WITH FULL US APPROVAL12 WE RECOMMEND THAT IMMEDIATE STEPS BE TAKEN TO ELIMINATE THE IMPENDING 3 MILLION SHORTFALL FOR FY                            73 BY MEANS OF ONE OR MORE OF THE FOLLOWING APPROACHES: A AN INCREASE                            IN MAP B BROADENING THE SPECTRUM OF

                 INCREASE OF UP TO 2 MILLION IN FY 73 WOULD IN FACT BE POSSIBLE FROM THE                            STANDPOINT OF ETHIOPIAS ABSORPTIVE CAPACITIES BUT POSSIBLE

ASKED ABOUT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN US AND YUGOSLAVIA ON WORLD PROBLEMS AND WHETHER THEY FOSTER MISUNDERSTANDINGS, RIBICIC SAID YUGOSLAVIA MAINTAINS POSITION THAT DIFFERENCES ON WORLD PROBLEMS SHOULD NOT STAND IN WAY OF WIDEST COOPERATION BILATERALLY IN ALL FIELDS OF COMMON INTEREST. THIS REGARD, HE REFERRED TO STRICT YUGOSLAV OBSERVANCE OF 1971 TITO-NIXON STATEMENT, SAYING YUGOSLAVS BELIEVE DIFFERENCES BOUND TO COME UP BUT YUGOSLAVS PLEAD FOR COMPREHENSIVE ADVANCEMENT AND DEVELOP- MENT OF MUTUAL RELATIONS.\n3.

                GIST IS THAT WE BELIEVE THE US SHOULD TAKE IMMEDIATE STEPS TO ASSIST                            ETHIOPIA IN THE LIGHT OF THE GROWING SOMALI MILITARY THREAT THE MOST                            IMPORTANT OF THESE BEING THE TOTAL ELIMINATION OF THE 3 MILLION                            SHORTFALL IN US MILITARY ASSISTANCE WHICH PRESENTLY APPEARS LIKELY FOR                            FY

THESE HAVE COMBINED TO HEIGHTEN                            CONCERN CLOSE TO ALARM3 THE MOST OMINIOUS DEVELOPMENT OF ALL HAS BEEN AN APPARENT INCREASE                            SINCE JULY 1 I972 IN THE TEMPO OF SOVIET DELIVERIES OF MILITARY                            EQUIPMENT TO SOMALIA AND IN THE ARRIVAL OF SOVIET MILITARY ADVISORS                            THE FACTS OF WHICH THEY ARE AWARE CONCERN ETHIOPIANS DEEPLY: THEIR                            UNCERTAINTY WHETHER EVEN MORE SIGNIFICANT DELIVERIES HAVE RECENTLY                            OCCURRED OR WILL SHORTLY OCCUR WORRIES THEM EVEN MORE4 ETHIOPIAN MILITARY LEADERS CONSIDER THAT THE PRESENT SOMALI THREAT                            CALLS FOR SUCH MAJOR STRENGTHENING OF ETHIOPIAN FORCES AS A MECHANIZED                            INFANTRY BRIDAGE NUMEROUS ADDITIONAL AIRCRAFT INCREASED AIR DEFENSE                            RADAR COVERAGE AND EIGHT MODERN PATROL CRAFT YET ALTHOUGH NUMEROUS                            ETHIOPIAN LEADERS HAVE OF LATE BEEN EMPHASIZING THEIR CONCERN TO US                            SPECIFIC REQUESTS FOR ADDITIONAL US ASSISTANCE HAVE THUS FAR BEEN                            SURPRISINGLY MODERATE THEY ARE NOT YET AWARE OF THE SHORTFALL IN US                            ASSISTANCE WHICH WE ANTICIPATE IN FY 73 WE BELIEVE THAT MORE                            SUBSTANTIAL REQUESTS ARE LIKELY BEFORE LONG HOWEVER AND WE NOTE IN                            THIS CONNECTION THE FOREIGN MINISTERS RECENT PREDICTION THAT HIS                            GOVERNMENT AND POSSIBLY THE EMPEROR HIMSELF WILL SOON REQUEST A BASIC                            DISCUSSION OF THE SOMALI THREAT WITH THE AMBASSADOR ADDIS 9832 WE                            ALSO BELIEVE THAT ANY HARD INFORMATION REGARDING THE DELIVERY OF MIG21S                            OR T54 TANKS TO SOMALIA WOULD TRIGGER A CONSIDERABLE INCREASE IN THE                            URGENCY AND MAGNITUDE OF ETHIOPIAN REQUESTS5 WE ARE BY NO MEANS INCLINED TO REGARD CURRENT ETHIOPIAN EXPRESSIONS OF                            APPREHENSION AS A PLOY TO IMPRESS THE US WE HAVE NO DOUBT THEY ARE                            SINCERE AND TO A LARGE EXTENT WE CONSIDER THEM JUSTIFIED THERE IS                            SUFFICIENT TERRITORIAL APPETITE AND POLITICAL INSTABILITY IN SOMALIA SO                            THAT THE POSSIBILITY OF A FUTURE DESIRE TO ATTACK ETHIOPIA POSSIBLY IN                            A PERIOD OF CONFUSION FOLLOWING THE EMPERORS DEATH MUST BE TAKEN                            SERIOUSLY THE SOVIETS WILL HOPEFULLY SEEK TO AVERT THIS DANGER BY                            CAREFULLY THROTTLING THEIR DELIVERIES TO SOMALIA BUT WITH THEIR RECORD                            IN THE ARABISRAELI CONFLICT IN MIND WE CANNOT AFFORD TO BE OVERLY                            OPTIMISTIC ON THIS SCORE SOVIET DELIVERIES SINCE JULY 1 1972 HAVE                            NOTICEABLY THOUGH NOT DRASTICALLY STRENGTHENED SOMALI MILITARY                            CAPABILITIES IN OUR JUDGMENT ETHIOPIA HAS GOOD REASON IN CONSEQUENCE TO                            STRENGTHEN ITS MILITARY POSTURE AND SHOULD CERTAINLY SEEK CONSIDERABLE                            STRENGTHENING IF SOMALIA SOON ACQUIRES OR IS FOUND TO HAVE ALREADY                            ACQUIRED SUCH IMPORTANT ADDITIONS AS A SIGNIFICANT QUANTITY OF MIG21S                            AMD T54 TANKS6 IF THE US REACTS TO CURRENT ETHIOPIAN APPREHENSION BY A SIMPLE                            CONTINUATION OF RECENT ATTITUDES AND PROGRAM TRENDS INCLUDING A MAP                            LEVEL OF 91 MILLION 86 MILLION EXLUDING PCHT  PACKAGING CRATING                            HANDLING AND TRANSPORTATION FOR THIS FISCAL YEAR AND PROBABLY FURTHER                            CUTS IN THE NEXT FISCAL YEAR THE IEG WILL CONCLUDE THAT US FRIENDSHIP                            IS OF VERY LIMITED VALUE AND THEIR LEADERS WILL FEEL CONSIDERABLE                            DISILLUSIONMENT AND BITTERNESS WE DO NOT ANTICIPATE THAT THIS WILL                            CAUSE A BASIC CHANGE IN ITS ATTITUDE TOWARDS KAGNEW OR SEVERE DAMAGE TO                            OTHER MAJOR US INTERESTS ALTHOUGH A CAVEAT MUST BE INSERTED THAT A                            TENNECO OIL STRIKE COULD AT ANY TIME ADD AN ADDITIONAL US INTEREST IN                            ETHIOPIA BUT IT WILL PROBABLY MAKE IT SOMEWHAT HARDER FOR THE US TO                            ATTAIN ITS OBJECTIVES WITH REGARD TO A WIDE RANGE OF ISSUES IN                            USETHIOPIAN RELATIONS VIGOROUS ETHIOPIAN EFFORTS TO OBTAIN MILITARY                            EQUIPMENT ON CREDIT FROM OTHER NONCOMMUNIST SOURCES CAN CERTAINLY BE                            ANTICIPATED MANY COUNTRIES WOULD GRADUALLY CONCLUDE THAT US WILLINGNESS                            TO HELP ITS FRIENDS IN TIME OF STRESS HAD REACHED A VERY LOW LEVEL A                            LIBYANARMED ELF MIGHT DECIDE TO ATTACK KAGNEW IF IT SAW CLEARLY HOW                            DISINCLINED THE US WAS TO ASSUME ANY FURTHER INVOLVEMENT IN ETHIOPIA                            LASTLY THERE WOULD SE A SOMEWHAT GREATER DANGER OF SOME FORM OF SOMALI                            AGGRESSION AGAINST EHTHIOPIA THAN IF THE US HAD CONTRIBUTED A LITTLE                            MORE TO ETHIOPIAN STRENGTH7 SHOULD THERE EVENTUALLY BE AN OUTBREAK OF SOME FORM OF HOSTILITIES                            WITH SOMALIA THE DISADVANTAGES FOR THE US MENTIONED IN THE PRECEDING                            PARAGRAPH WOULD SE INTENSIFIED8 THESE CONSEQUENCES OF A SIMPLE CONTINUATION OF RECENT US ATTITUDES AND                            PROGRAM TRENDS ARE SUFFICIENTLY UNPLEASANT IN OUR VIEW TO JUSTIFY A                            THOROUGH SEARCH FOR ADDITIONAL ACTIONS WHICH THE US COULD TAKE AT                            PRESENT TO REASSURE ETHIOPIA TO STRENGTHEN ITS MILITARY CAPABILITIES                            AND TO LESSEN THE LIKELIHOOD OF SOMALI AGGRESSION THE RESULTS OF SUCH                            AN EXAMINATION ON OUR PART ARE SUMMARIZED IN THE FOLLOWING                            PARAGRAPHSA THAT A

SUCH AS AN IMPROVED COMMAND AND                            CONTROL STRUCTURE AND VARIOUS DEPLOYMENT IMPROVEMENTS WHICH IT HAS BEEN                            RECOMMENDING AND WHICH IT WILL CONTINUE TO PROMOTE VIGOROUSLY11 WITH REGARD TO US MILITARY ASSISTANCE A SHORTFALL OF 3 MILLION FROM                            THE DOD MAP OBJECTIVE OF 115 MILLION NOT INCLUDING PCHT NOW APPEARS                            LIKELY FOR FY 73 AND WE SUSPECT THAT THE SHORTFALL FOR FY 74 WILL BE                            EVEN GREATER IF EVENTS ARE ALLOWED TO TAKE THEIR NATURAL COURSE SUCH                            SHORTFALLS COULD PERHAPS HAVE BEEN DIGESTED WITHOUT UNACCEPTABLE DAMAGE                            TO US INTERESTS IF ETHIOPIANSOMALIA RELATIONS WERE NOW APPROXIMATELY                            THE SAME AS WAS THE CASE A YEAR AGO THAT IS DECIDEDLY NOT THE CASE                            UNDER PRESENT CIRCUMSTANCES WE ASCRIBE GREAT IMPORTANCE IN TERMS OF US                            INTERESTS TO THE TOTAL ELMINATION OF THE SHORTFALL THREATENING FOR BOTH                            FY 73 AND FY 74 SUCH ACTION IS NEEDED BOTH IN TERMS OF THE REAL SOMALI                            THREAT AND THE EXPECTATIONS WHICH THE IEG IS ENTITLED TO HAVE REGARDING                            US ASSISTANCE IN TIMES OF GATHERING PERIL ASSISTANCE WHICH WILL MERELY                            PERMIT A STRAIGHTLINE CONTINUATION OF THE MODEST MODERNIZATION PROGRAM                            WHICH BEGAN IN FY 71 WITH FULL US APPROVAL12 WE RECOMMEND THAT IMMEDIATE STEPS BE TAKEN TO ELIMINATE THE IMPENDING 3 MILLION SHORTFALL FOR FY                            73 BY MEANS OF ONE OR MORE OF THE FOLLOWING APPROACHES: A AN INCREASE                            IN MAP B BROADENING THE SPECTRUM OF

UPON A                            SHRINKING MAP BUDGET ALTERNATIVE B SHOULD BE FEASIBLE WITHOUT MUCH                            DIFFICULTY IN OUR VIEW TO A LEVEL OF ABOUT 900000 THIS YEAR AN                            INCREASE OF UP TO 2 MILLION IN FY 73 WOULD IN FACT BE POSSIBLE FROM THE                            STANDPOINT OF ETHIOPIAS ABSORPTIVE CAPACITIES BUT POSSIBLE

PROFESSOR B. R. SHENOY, OF THE ECONOMICS RESEARCH CENTRE, NEW DELHI, IS EVIDENTLY PLANNING TO WRITE TO ALL MEMBERS OF THE FOREIGN RELATIONS AND FOREIGN AFFAIRS AND AGRICUL- TURE COMMITTEES EXPRESSING HIS OPPOSITION TO THE RUPEE AGREEMENT. PROFESSOR SHENOY HAS BEEN ACTIVE FOR YEARS IN ATTACKING USG HOLDINGS OF RUPEES CLAIMING THAT THESE HOLDINGS WERE INFLATIONARY. WITH THE INITIALING OF A RUPEE AGREEMENT, HE HAS NOW COME TO THE ERRONEOUS CONCLUSION THAT ALL THESE RUPEE HOLDINGS WOULD BE ""MONETIZED"" AND THATTHIS WOULD CAUSE EVENTUAL INFLATION.\n2.  SHENOY IS CONSIDERED A DECENT BUT CRACKPOT ECONOMIST WHOSE PEARLS OF WISDOM HAVE OFTEN BEEN SENT TO VARIOUS US POLITICAL FIGURES. HIS WRITINGS APPEAR EXTENSIVELY IN THE FAR RIGHT WING PRESS IN INDIA, ALSO OCCASIONALLY IN MORE RESPECTABLE PUBLICATIONS.  THE INDIAN GOVERNMENT CONSIDERS HIM AN ECCENTRIC WHOM IT GENERALLY IGNORES.\n3.  IN VIEW OF THE LIKELIHOOD THAT CONGRESSIONAL FIGURES MAY REQUEST INFORMATION ON PROFESSOR SHENOY AND HIS POINT OF VIEW, WE ARE TODAY POUCHING COPIES OF HIS ARTICLE AND LETTER TO THE AMBASSADOR, AS WELL AS THE EMBASSYS REPLY.

THE COUNCIL HAS VERIFIED THAT ONE OF THESE ISLANDS-- CONFIDENTIAL THE ISLAND OF ITU ABA, KNOWN TO US AS LIGAW--IS NOW UNDER OCCUPATION BY NATIONALIST CHINESE FORCES WHO HAVE FORTIFIED THE ISLAND WITH GUN EMPLACEMENT AND WHO HAVE ON A NUMBER OF OCCASIONS, FIRED WARNING SHOTS ON RECONNAISSANCE AIR- CRAFT AND MARITIME VESSELS.\n3. THE COUNCIL IS OF THE UNANIMOUS OPINION THAT BECAUSE OF THE FAST PACE OF DEVELOPMENTS IN THE REGION AND BECAUSE OF THE PROXIMITY TO THE ISLAND TO OUR NATIONAL TERRITORY ITS OCCUPATION BY A FOREIGN POWER CONSTITUTES A SERIOUS THREAT TO OUR NATIONAL SECURITY.\n4. THE ISLAND HAS A STRATEGIC IMPORTANCE TO THE SECURITY OF THE PHILIPPINES. IT IS LOCATED 489 MILES FROM MANILA,\n5. IN 1957, WE AFFIRMED THAT THE SPRATLEY ISLAND GROUP FALLS UNDER THE DE FACTO TRUSTEESHIP OF THE ALLIED POWERS BY VIRTUE OF THE JAPANESE PEACE TREATY SIGNED AND CON- CLUDED IN SAN FRANCISCO ON SEPTEMBER 8, 1951, WHEREBY JAPAN RENOUNCED ALL HER RIGHTS, TITLE AND CLAIM TO THESE ISLANDS. BY VIRTUE OF THAT TRUSTEESHIP NO ONE MAY INTRO- DUCE TROOPS ON ANY OF THESE ISLANDS WITHOUT THE PERMISSION AND CONSENT OF THE ALLIED POWERS. OUR POSITION ON THIS MATTER REMAINS FIRM.\n6. BECAUSE THE CHINESE GARRISON ON LIGAW WAS ESTABLISHED ON THE ISLAND WITHOUT THE PERMISSION AND CONSENT OF THE ALLIES, WE HAVE REQUESTED THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT TO WITH- DRAW ITS TROOPS FROM THERE. THREE DAYS AGO THE FOREIGN OFFICE CONVEYED THAT REQUEST TO THE CHINESE EMBASSY IN MANILA, AND THE COUNCIL TODAY RATIFIED THAT DECISION.\n7. AT THE SAME TIME WE MUST ANNOUNCE THAT THE GOVERNMENT HAS TAKEN ADEQUATE STEPS TO PROTECT ITS INTERESTS AND THE INTERESTS OF ITS CITIZENS IN RELATION TO THE OTHER ISLANDS CONFIDENTIAL OF FREEDOMLAND.\n8. FREEDOMLAND REFERES TO THE 53 ISLAND GROUP, WITH THE EXCLUSION OF THE SPRATLEYS, WHICH FILIPINO EXPLORER TOMAS CLOMA EXPLORED AND OCCUPIED FROM 1950 TO 1974.  THESE ARE ISLANDS, ISLETS, CORAL REEFS, CAYS AND BANKS WHICH ARE REGARDED AS RES NULLIUS AND MAYBE ACQUIRED ACCORDING TO THE MODES OF ACQUISITION RECOGNIZED UNDER INTERNATIONAL LAW - AMONG WHICH IS OCCUPATION AND EFFECTIVE ADMINISTRATION.\n9. WE ARE ABLE TO ANNOUNCE THAT INSOFAR AS THESE ISLANDS ARE CONCERNED, WE ARE IN EFFECTIVE OCCUPATION AND CONTROL OF THE ISLANDS OF PAGASA,SLAWAK AND PATAG. END TEXT SULLIVAN\n",791183

ONLY IF WE                            COLLAPSE INTERNALLY FOR THIS REASON IT WAS ALL THE MORE IMPROTANT TO                            PUT OWN HOUSE IN ORDER5 THE PM STRESSED HIS TOTAL DECIATION TO

PREPARED FOR MUCH MORE SACIFICE HE RETURNED AGAIN TO STRESS HIS HOPE                            THAT THE AMERICAN GOVERNMENT WOULD UNDERSTAND A TURNING POINT IN HIS                            COUTNRY HAD BEEN FINALLY REACHED AND THAT THERE WAS NOW AN OPPORTUNTIY                            FOR MANY IDEALS SHARED BETWEEN THE AMERICAN AND AGHAN PEOPLE TO FIND                            ROOT AND

INTERESTS IN SAYING THIS: SINCE HE WAS CONVINCED THERE WERE                            NO BASIC DIFFERENCES BETWEEN OUR TWO COUNTRIES HE HOPED THAT THE                            AMERICAN GOVERNMENT WOULD TRY TO THINK OF WAYS IT COULD HELP AFGHANISTAN                            PUT ITS HOUSE IN ORDER EVEN TO THE EXTENT OF GOING BEYOND OUR NORMAL                            PROCEDURES BUT HE ALSO HOPED WE WOULD SUGGEST WAY IN WHICH AFGHANISTAN                            COULD HELP US IN MATTERS OF MUTUAL INTEREST AND CONCERN COMMENT: THIS                            DELICATE MESSAGE REPEATS EARLIER COMMENTS OF MUSA SHAFIQS OVER PAST YEAR IN WHICH HE HAS SUGGESTED A                            MORE ACTIVE DIPLOMATIC ROLE FOR AFGHANISTAN COULD BE HELPFUL TO US ON

IN BOTH COUNTRIES ESPECIALLY THE USSR THERE                            WERE ELEMENTS WHO WOULD NEED                            LITTLE PROVOCATION TO TAKE A DIFFERENT LINE IN THIS CONNECTION HE WAS

AT BRIEF INTERVALS AFTER MIDNIGHT JANUARY 11 BOMBS WERE THROWN AT THREE ROME BUILDINGS HOUSING ITT SUBSIDIARIES. IN APPARENTLY RELATED ATTACK, TRUCK BELONGING TO ITALIAN TELEPHONE LINE MAINTENANCE FIRM NOT RPT NOT, HOWEVER, AFFILIATED WITH ITT, WAS BURNED.\n2. FIRST ATTACK HEAVILY DAMAGED COMPUTER CENTER OF SMALL ITALIAN BUSINESS CONSULTING FIRM IN BUILDING HOUSING SEVERAL US COMPANIES (INCLUDING ABC AND PEPSI COLA). OFFICES OF ITT SUBSIDIARY, FACE STANDARD (MANUFACTIRERS OF ELECTRIC AND ELECOMMUNICATIONS EQUIPMENT) ON THIRD FLOOR OF BUILDING ESCAPED DAMAGE. SECOND AND THIRD EXPLOSIONS DAMAGED FACADE OF ITT OWNED INTERCONTINENTAL INSURANCE COMPANY AND BROKE WINDOWS IN WAREHOUSE OF FACE STANDARD SUBSIDIARY, SIETTE SPA, A TELEPHONE INSTALLATION COMPANY.\n3. ANTI-ITT POLITICAL MOTIVATION FOR ATTACKS, WHICH PROBABLY INVOLVED MORE THAN ONE TEAM OF BOMBERS, WAS MADE CLEAR BY NOTE FOUND AT SCENE OF TRUCK FIRE. NOTE IN ITALIAN READ ""ITT IS FOCAL POINT OF THE (FORCES OF) REACTION AND (IS) THE HAND OF THE AMERICAN SECURITY SERVICES. IT IS THE ITT THAT ORGANIZED THE COUP DETAT IN CHILE AND THAT ORGANIZED THE CONFIDENTIAL TELEPHONE TAPPING IN ITALY IN ORDER TO PREPARE ALSO HERE A REACTIONARY SWING IN ACCORD WITH THE FASCISTS. THE WORKING CLASS WILL BAR THE PASSAGE AGAINST REACTION AND WILL STRIKE HARD AT THE VIOLENCE OF THE GOVERNMENT, OF THE FASCISTS AND OF THE CIA. THE CLASS STRUGGLE WILL CAUSE THE FAILURE OF EVERY RRACTIONARY PROJECT FOR SOCIAL PEACE (PACE SOCIALE) AND POLICE DETENTION (FERMO DI POLIZIA)"" BURNED TRUCK BELONGED TO COMPANY WHICH, ALTHOUGH NOT OWNED BY ITT, WAS INVOLVED TOGETHER WITH SIETTE SPA IN LEFT WING CHARGES LAST YEAR OF COLLABORATION WITH ALLEGED POLICE PHONE TAPPING OPERATIONS.\n4. ITT HAS BEEN TARGET OF FREQUENT ATTACKS IN LEFT WING PRESS SINCE CHILE COUP. ITT SOURCE STATES THAT COMPANY HAS NOT RECENTLY RECEIVED THREATS, ALTHOUGH SMALL BOMB WAS SET OFF SOME MONTHS AGO AT ROME OFFICE OF ITT SWISS SUBSIDIARY. HOWEVER, SOURCE SAID THAT PROMISING ITT INITIATIVE TO HELP SOUTHERN ITALIAN ELECTRONICS COMPANIES MARKET THEIR PRODUCTS ABROAD THROUGH ITT FELL THROUGH AFTER CHILE EVENTS - APPARENTLY AS DIRECT RESULT OF ADVERSE PUBLICITY ITT RECEIVED.\n5. COMMUNIST PARTY ORGAN, LUNITA, DENOUNCED ATTACKS AS PROVOCATION DESIGNED TO STIR UP CLIMATE OF TENSION. (COMMENT: AT TIME WHEN PCI HEAVILY ENGAGED IN TRYING TO BUILD ANTI-FASCIST FRONT WITH DEMOCRATIC PARTIES AND IN ENHANCING ITS NON-EXTREMIST IMAGE, ATTACK IS SURELY UNWELCOME TO COMMUNISTS, DESPITE IDENTITY OF ITS VICTIM.)

IT ONLY US  APART FROM CHINA  AMONG                            MAJOR POWERS HAD SHOWN SYMPATHY FOR PLIGHT AND HAD GIVEN ANY POLITICAL                            SUPPORT TO PAKISTAN IN ITS TIME OF

IN DEALING WITH GOP ON CONTENT AND NATURE OF THEIR NEW                            RELATIONSHIP MOST THAT CAN BE SAID IS THAT IF BHUTTO FAILS IN MOVING FROM                            CONFRONTATION TO PEACEFUL COEXISTENCE AS SPECIFIED IN SIMLA                            AGREEMENT PROSPECT OF SUCCESS FOR ANY SUCCESSOR REGIME LIKELY TO BE                            GRIM30 LOOKING BEYOND SUBCONTINENT

PAKISTAN S TIES WITH MAJOR POWERS BELIEVE HE ALSO HOPES                            TO STAKE OUT POSITION OF MORE  INDEPENDENCE IN FOREIGN AFFAIRS IN                            ORDER GIVE PAKISTAN

PROFESSOR B. R. SHENOY, OF THE ECONOMICS RESEARCH CENTRE, NEW DELHI, IS EVIDENTLY PLANNING TO WRITE TO ALL MEMBERS OF THE FOREIGN RELATIONS AND FOREIGN AFFAIRS AND AGRICUL- TURE COMMITTEES EXPRESSING HIS OPPOSITION TO THE RUPEE AGREEMENT. PROFESSOR SHENOY HAS BEEN ACTIVE FOR YEARS IN ATTACKING USG HOLDINGS OF RUPEES CLAIMING THAT THESE HOLDINGS WERE INFLATIONARY. WITH THE INITIALING OF A RUPEE AGREEMENT, HE HAS NOW COME TO THE ERRONEOUS CONCLUSION THAT ALL THESE RUPEE HOLDINGS WOULD BE ""MONETIZED"" AND THATTHIS WOULD CAUSE EVENTUAL INFLATION.\n2.  SHENOY IS CONSIDERED A DECENT BUT CRACKPOT ECONOMIST WHOSE PEARLS OF WISDOM HAVE OFTEN BEEN SENT TO VARIOUS US POLITICAL FIGURES. HIS WRITINGS APPEAR EXTENSIVELY IN THE FAR RIGHT WING PRESS IN INDIA, ALSO OCCASIONALLY IN MORE RESPECTABLE PUBLICATIONS.  THE INDIAN GOVERNMENT CONSIDERS HIM AN ECCENTRIC WHOM IT GENERALLY IGNORES.\n3.  IN VIEW OF THE LIKELIHOOD THAT CONGRESSIONAL FIGURES MAY REQUEST INFORMATION ON PROFESSOR SHENOY AND HIS POINT OF VIEW, WE ARE TODAY POUCHING COPIES OF HIS ARTICLE AND LETTER TO THE AMBASSADOR, AS WELL AS THE EMBASSYS REPLY.

HOWEVER OF CONSIDERABLY GREATER CONCERN IS SPECTRE OF USSR IN BACKGROUND24 RELATIONS WITH US: AT END OF 1971 WAR US WAS SECOND ONLY TO CHINA IN                            PAK ESTEEM SINCE AS PAKS SAW IT ONLY US  APART FROM CHINA  AMONG                            MAJOR POWERS HAD SHOWN SYMPATHY FOR PLIGHT AND HAD GIVEN ANY POLITICAL                            SUPPORT TO PAKISTAN IN ITS TIME OF

IN DEALING WITH GOP ON CONTENT AND NATURE OF THEIR NEW                            RELATIONSHIP MOST THAT CAN BE SAID IS THAT IF BHUTTO FAILS IN MOVING FROM                            CONFRONTATION TO PEACEFUL COEXISTENCE AS SPECIFIED IN SIMLA                            AGREEMENT PROSPECT OF SUCCESS FOR ANY SUCCESSOR REGIME LIKELY TO BE                            GRIM30 LOOKING BEYOND SUBCONTINENT

PAKISTAN S TIES WITH MAJOR POWERS BELIEVE HE ALSO HOPES                            TO STAKE OUT POSITION OF MORE  INDEPENDENCE IN FOREIGN AFFAIRS IN                            ORDER GIVE PAKISTAN

IN APPARENTLY RELATED ATTACK, TRUCK BELONGING TO ITALIAN TELEPHONE LINE MAINTENANCE FIRM NOT RPT NOT, HOWEVER, AFFILIATED WITH ITT, WAS BURNED.\n2. FIRST ATTACK HEAVILY DAMAGED COMPUTER CENTER OF SMALL ITALIAN BUSINESS CONSULTING FIRM IN BUILDING HOUSING SEVERAL US COMPANIES (INCLUDING ABC AND PEPSI COLA).

SECOND AND THIRD EXPLOSIONS DAMAGED FACADE OF ITT OWNED INTERCONTINENTAL INSURANCE COMPANY AND BROKE WINDOWS IN WAREHOUSE OF FACE STANDARD SUBSIDIARY, SIETTE SPA, A TELEPHONE INSTALLATION COMPANY.\n3. ANTI-ITT POLITICAL MOTIVATION FOR ATTACKS, WHICH PROBABLY INVOLVED MORE THAN ONE TEAM OF BOMBERS, WAS MADE CLEAR BY NOTE FOUND AT SCENE OF TRUCK FIRE. NOTE IN ITALIAN READ ""ITT IS FOCAL POINT OF THE (FORCES OF) REACTION AND (IS) THE HAND OF THE AMERICAN SECURITY SERVICES. IT IS THE ITT THAT ORGANIZED THE COUP DETAT IN CHILE AND THAT ORGANIZED THE CONFIDENTIAL TELEPHONE TAPPING IN ITALY IN ORDER TO PREPARE ALSO HERE A REACTIONARY SWING IN ACCORD WITH THE FASCISTS. THE WORKING CLASS WILL BAR THE PASSAGE AGAINST REACTION AND WILL STRIKE HARD AT THE VIOLENCE OF THE GOVERNMENT, OF THE FASCISTS AND OF THE CIA. THE CLASS STRUGGLE WILL CAUSE THE FAILURE OF EVERY RRACTIONARY PROJECT FOR SOCIAL PEACE (PACE SOCIALE) AND POLICE DETENTION (FERMO DI POLIZIA)"" BURNED TRUCK BELONGED TO COMPANY WHICH, ALTHOUGH NOT OWNED BY ITT, WAS INVOLVED TOGETHER WITH SIETTE SPA IN LEFT WING CHARGES LAST YEAR OF COLLABORATION WITH ALLEGED POLICE PHONE TAPPING OPERATIONS.\n4. ITT HAS BEEN TARGET OF FREQUENT ATTACKS IN LEFT WING PRESS SINCE CHILE COUP. ITT SOURCE STATES THAT COMPANY HAS NOT RECENTLY RECEIVED THREATS, ALTHOUGH SMALL BOMB WAS SET OFF SOME MONTHS AGO AT ROME OFFICE OF ITT SWISS SUBSIDIARY. HOWEVER, SOURCE SAID THAT PROMISING ITT INITIATIVE TO HELP SOUTHERN ITALIAN ELECTRONICS COMPANIES MARKET THEIR PRODUCTS ABROAD THROUGH ITT FELL THROUGH AFTER CHILE EVENTS - APPARENTLY AS DIRECT RESULT OF ADVERSE PUBLICITY ITT RECEIVED.\n5. COMMUNIST PARTY ORGAN, LUNITA, DENOUNCED ATTACKS AS PROVOCATION DESIGNED TO STIR UP CLIMATE OF TENSION. (COMMENT: AT TIME WHEN PCI HEAVILY ENGAGED IN TRYING TO BUILD ANTI-FASCIST FRONT WITH DEMOCRATIC PARTIES AND IN ENHANCING ITS NON-EXTREMIST IMAGE, ATTACK IS SURELY UNWELCOME TO COMMUNISTS, DESPITE IDENTITY OF ITS VICTIM.)

               AREAS GDS SOBER,frus1969-76ve08d103,"1. THE EMBASSY WELCOMES THE SECRETARYS AFFIRMATION OF HIS LIMITED OFFICIAL USE\n2. OUR VIEWS ON WAYS TO STRENGTHEN OUR COMMERCIAL OPERATIONS WERE STATED IN SOME DETAIL IN PARIS 5369 OF MARCH 21, 1972, AND PARIS 21641. WHERE ACTION ON THESE RECOMMENDATIONS LAY WITHIN OUR OWN POWER, WE HAVE ACTED. OUR ACTIONS HAVE BEEN CONCENTRATED IN THREE MAIN AREAS; (A) INVOLVING THE ENTIRE EMBASSY IN COMMERCIAL WORK TO THE EXTENT FEASIBLE. (B) REALLOCATING RESOURCES TO THE COMMERCIAL PROGRAM, AND (C) STRENGTHENING THE ROLE OF COMMERCIAL OFFICERS.\n3. IN THE FIRST AREA, WE HAVE ESTABLISHED AN EMBASSY TRADE PROMOTION COMMITTEE WITH REPRESENTATION FROM ALL THE MAJOR SECTIONS OF THE MEBASSY. THE PERIODIC MEETINGS OF THIS COMMITTEE HAVE GREATLY INCREASED THE AWARENESS OF THE IMPORTANCE OF COMMERCIAL WORK ON THE PART OF THE OTHER SECTIONS AND OF THE OPPORTUNITIES WHICH EXIST FOR A CONRIBUTION BY THEM. THE COMMITTEE HAS BEEN PARTICULARLY VALUABLE AS AN AGENCY FOR COORDINATING INTELLIGENCE ON MAJOR PROJECTS. WE HAVE ALSO STRENGTHENED OUR PROGRAM FOR SUPPORTING THE COMMERCIAL WORK OF THE CONSULATES.\n4. IN THE SECOND AREA, WE HAVE CREATED THE NUCLEUS OF AN ADDITIONAL INDUSTRY UNIT IN THE COMMERCIAL OFFICE BY TRANSFERRING TO THAT OFFICE AN FSO FROM ELSEWHERE IN THE CONOMIC SECTION AND WE ARE INVESTIGATING THE POSSIBILITY OF REASSIGNING TWO FRENCH NATIONALS IN ORDER TO FILL OUT THIS UNIT.\n5. IN THE THIRD AREA WE ARE EXPERIMENTING WITH THE TECHNIQUE OF SETTING UP TEMPORARY AD HOC TASK FORCES COMPRISED OF ECONOMIC AND COMMERCIAL OFFICERS TO DEAL WITH SPECIFIC PROBLEMS. ONE OF THE MAIN PURPOSES OF THIS EXPERIMENT IS TO ENHANCE THE ROLE OF COMMERCIAL OFFICERS BY INVOLVING THEM MORE EXTENSIVELY IN SUBSTANTIVE WORK. OUR EXPERIENCE WITH A TASK FORCE SET-UP TO EXAMINE THE EFFECTS OF THE ENERGY CRISIS ON THE FRENCH ECONOMY HAS BEEN PARTICULARLY ENCOURAGING.\n6. WE SHALL CONTINUE TO SEEK OPPORTUNITIES WITHIN THE LIMITS OF OUR OWN RESOURCES TO STRENGTHEN OUR COMMERCIAL PROGRAM. BUT WE BELIEVE THE DEPARTMENT SHOULD BE AWARE THAT IN THE SECOND AND THIRD AREAS THESE LIMITS ARE EXTREMELY NARROW. IN THE SECOND AREA, WE BELIEVE, AS WE STATED IN PARIS 5369, THAT A CASE CAN BE MADE FOR INCREASING THE PERSONNEL RESOURCES ASSIGNED TO COMMERCIAL WORK. BUT WE RECOGNIZE THAT THE PROSPECTS FOR OBTAINING ADDITIONAL POSITIONS ARE MEAGRE AND THAT THE ONLY SURE WAY TO INCREASE COMMERCIAL STAFF IS BY REALLOCATING RESOURCES INTERNALLY. AS WE NOTED ABOVE, WE HAVE ALREADY TAKEN CERTAIN STEPS IN THIS DIRECTION AND WE PLAN FURTHER STEPS. WE ARE ESTABLISHING AN EMBASSY TASK FORCE TO LOOK INTO THE POSSIBILITIES FOR TRANSFERRING POSITIONS FROM OTHER MISSION ACTIVITES WHICH WE BELIEVE ENJOY A LOWER PRIORITY THAN EXPORT PROMOTION. BUT IT SHOULD BE RECOGNIZED THAT IT IS EXTREMELY DIFFICULT FOR AN EMBASSY TO TRANSFER POSITIONS FROM, SAY, THE POLITICAL OR THE ADMINISTRATIVE SECTIONS TO THE COMMERCIAL SECTION WITHOUT A MUCH MORE AUTHORITATIVE ASSESSSMENT THAN IS NOW AVAILABLE OF U.S. OBJECTIVES AND PRIORITIES IN THE HOST COUNTRY AS WEIGHED AGAINST THE OVERALL VIEW OF US INTERESTS. WE BELIEVE THAT THE DEPARTMENT MUST DEVELOP A MUCH MORE EFFECTIVE INSTRUMENT THAN IT NOW POSSESSES FOR DETERMINING THESE OBJECTIVES AND PRIORITIES. A START HAS BEEN MADE IN THE EUROPEAN BUREAU WITH THE PARA SYSTEM, BUT IN THEIR PRESENT FORM THE PARA PAPERS COVER ONLY PA (POLICY ANALYSIS) BUT NOT RA (RESOURCE ALLOCATION). THEY ARE THUS INCAPABLE OF PROVIDING GUIDANCE AND AUTHORITY WHICH WOULD PERMIT A RATIONAL REALLOCATION OF RESOURCES WITHIN AN EMBASSY ON ANY BUT THE SMALLEST SCALE. WE BELIEVE THE DEPARTMENT SHOULD ASSIGN A HIGH PRIORITY TO THE PERFECTION OF THIS SYSTEM.\n7. THERE ARE SIMILAR LIMITATIONS ON THE ABILITY OF AN EMBASSY TO INCREASE THE INTEGRATION OF ECONOMIC AND COMMERCIAL WORK. OUR VIEWS ON THIS SUBJECT WILL BE STATED MORE FULLY IN OUR REPLY TO THE DEPARTMENTS A-10322. FOR THE PRESENT, SUFFICE IT TO SAY THAT, WITHOUT THE FULL BACKING OF THE VARIOUS WASINGTON AGENCIES WITH FOREIGN ECONOMIC RESPONSIBILITIES AND REPRESENTATION, IT IS SIMPLY UNREALISTIC TO TALK ABOUT THE INTEGRATION OF ANY POSITIONS EXCEPT THOSE OCCUPIED BY FSOS.\n8. A RECOMMENDATION MADE IN EARLIER MESSAGES WHICH WE SHOULD LIKE TO REPEAT IS THE ONE CONCERNING THE STRENGTHENING OF THE COMMERCE DISTRICT OFFICES. WITHOUT EFFECTIVE FOLLO-UP OF TRADE OPPORTUNITIES BY THESE OFFICES, MUCH OF THE FIELDS WORK WILL BE IN VAIN. A START HAS BEEN MADE IN THIS DIRECTION, BUT WE DO NOT BELIEVE IT IS ENOUGH.\n7.

India by                        Nepali Congress dissidents and impact of shortages in India on Nepalese                        economy are principal sources of friction USG will want to avoid involvement in these disputes as long as                        regional stability not threatened and to maintain existing policies based on                        our bilateral interests in each country END SUMMARY2 In recent weeks there have been increasing storm signals in IndoNepalese                        relations At various places along IndoNepalese border minor but violent                        incidents have occurred in which socalled antisocial elements have been                        attacking police posts looting grain stocks and in most serious incident                        attempting bomb principal bank at Biratnagar It is widely accepted by                        Nepalese that antisocial elements are in fact Nepali Congress dissidents                        operating from Indian sanctuaries with aim of undermining regime of KING                        BIRENDRA Given understanding which GON                        received from GOI during KINGs State visit                        to Delhi that NCP dissidents would be kept at least fifty miles from border                        Nepalese are concerned about Indian intentions This concern is intensified                        by belief that Nepal has not received what it considers to be adequate                        satisfaction from GOI authorities on 1972                        Haripur incident and subsequent RNAC skyjacking3 As Embassy Delhi rightly observes GOI is sympathetic to democratic                        forces in Nepal It probably cannot control all crossborder activities of                        NCP adherents though GON undoubtedly                        expects it to do so and interprets failure in this regard as evidence of Indian pressure for                        political change As we indicated RefTel                        B we anticipate some increase in level of unrest in Nepal unless economic                        situation takes unexpected turn for better In this situation violent                        incidents may increase and India is likely to get the blame The more that                        Indian politicians and diplomats talk about Indian affinity for democratic                        systems the more this is read in Kathmandu as intent to support subversion                        from without We do not anticipate that rising violence will have effect of                        pursuading KING to liberalize his regime as Indians might like and                        repression seems more likely than compromise4 If in these circumstances COI may be tempted to unleash NCP effects                        on stability in Nepal could be serious It is of course not in our                        interest that India meddle in Nepals internal affairs not only because of                        adverse impact on development prospects but also because of enhanced                        dangerof SinoIndian confrontation in and over Nepal5 On economic front Nepalese are chafing under terms of trade and transit                        agreement They believe India is able to meet Nepalese economic demands                        which they perceive to be limited in scope Nepalese do not understand that                        India cannot always meet requirements of extremely backward country of 12                        million people Petroleum and other shortages which have already developed                        here or which are likely to develop may well be seen by Nepalese as                        evidence of deliberate Indian policy rather than as inevitable result of                        worldwide situation6 Unfortunately Indian aid while generous in global terms has not done                        much to increase longrun selfreliance of Nepal which may in fact be                        economic chimaera Infrastructure projects such as EastWest highway or Kosi                        barrage are felt by Nepalese to be as much in Indias strategic and economic                        interest as in Nepals GONs skittishness                        about Karnali is in part reflection of Nepals preoccupation that it not be                        taken for economic ride in any future agreements with India Given virtual                        total dependence of Nepalese economy on India GON fears being dragged down by Indian economic failure but is                        not yet mature enough to recognize it could be buoyed up by Indian                        success7 Question of economic relationship between India and Nepal is one which has                        dimension for US policy During 1960s we endeavored to encourage economic                        and strategic complementarity between Nepal and India In recent years and                        particularly since 1971 we have tried to look at Nepal as entity worthy of                        attention in its own right This does not mean however that the                        imperatives of economic interdependence between Nepal and India can or                        should be depreciated On contrary a constructive amicable and mutually                        supportive interdependence between the two countries serves our basic                        interests in stability and economic development in the subcontinent While                        recognizing the benefits of some diversification in Nepali trade we do not                        believe it would be either possible or desirable to embark on policies                        designed to alter significantly the interdependence between Nepal and                        India8 As and if tensions rise in Nepal and economic and political frictions                        between Nepal and India increase we will want in Nepal to maintain our                        current posture of steady and sympathetic support for Nepals development                        objectives and political integrity As long as regional stability not                        threatened we would not propose to offer Nepal advice about its relations                        with India any more than we should offer India advice about its relations                        with Nepal No doubt both sides will be free in their advice to us on how to                        handle our relations with the other but this we can standCARGO WIC initialed,frus1969-76ve08d245,"1.

KATHMANDU 44961 SUMMARY: Looked at from Kathmandu frictions between India and Nepal seem                        to be on the increase and may well further intensify in 1974 Minor border raids from India by                        Nepali Congress dissidents and impact of shortages in India on Nepalese                        economy are principal sources of friction USG will want to avoid involvement in these disputes as long as                        regional stability not threatened and to maintain existing policies based on                        our bilateral interests in each country END SUMMARY2 In recent weeks there have been increasing storm signals in IndoNepalese                        relations At various places along IndoNepalese border minor but violent                        incidents have occurred in which socalled antisocial elements have been                        attacking police posts looting grain stocks and in most serious incident                        attempting bomb principal bank at Biratnagar It is widely accepted by                        Nepalese that antisocial elements are in fact Nepali Congress dissidents                        operating from Indian sanctuaries with aim of undermining regime of KING                        BIRENDRA Given understanding which GON                        received from GOI during KINGs State visit

         by belief that Nepal has not received what it considers to be adequate                        satisfaction from GOI authorities on 1972                        Haripur incident and subsequent RNAC skyjacking3 As Embassy Delhi rightly observes GOI is sympathetic to democratic                        forces in Nepal It probably cannot control all crossborder activities of                        NCP adherents though GON undoubtedly                        expects it to do so and interprets failure in this regard as evidence of Indian pressure for                        political change As we indicated RefTel                        B we anticipate some increase in level of unrest in Nepal unless economic                        situation takes unexpected turn for better In this situation violent                        incidents may increase and India is likely to get the blame The more that                        Indian politicians and diplomats talk about Indian affinity for democratic                        systems the more this is read in Kathmandu as intent to support subversion                        from without We do not anticipate that rising violence will have

THE EMBASSY WELCOMES THE SECRETARYS AFFIRMATION OF HIS LIMITED OFFICIAL USE\n2. OUR VIEWS ON WAYS TO STRENGTHEN OUR COMMERCIAL OPERATIONS WERE STATED IN SOME DETAIL IN PARIS 5369 OF MARCH 21, 1972, AND PARIS 21641. WHERE ACTION ON THESE RECOMMENDATIONS LAY WITHIN OUR OWN POWER, WE HAVE ACTED. OUR ACTIONS HAVE BEEN CONCENTRATED IN THREE MAIN AREAS; (A) INVOLVING THE ENTIRE EMBASSY IN COMMERCIAL WORK TO THE EXTENT FEASIBLE. (B) REALLOCATING RESOURCES TO THE COMMERCIAL PROGRAM, AND (C) STRENGTHENING THE ROLE OF COMMERCIAL OFFICERS.\n3. IN THE FIRST AREA, WE HAVE ESTABLISHED AN EMBASSY TRADE PROMOTION COMMITTEE WITH REPRESENTATION FROM ALL THE MAJOR SECTIONS OF THE MEBASSY. THE PERIODIC MEETINGS OF THIS COMMITTEE HAVE GREATLY INCREASED THE AWARENESS OF THE IMPORTANCE OF COMMERCIAL WORK ON THE PART OF THE OTHER SECTIONS AND OF THE OPPORTUNITIES WHICH EXIST FOR A CONRIBUTION BY THEM. THE COMMITTEE HAS BEEN PARTICULARLY VALUABLE AS AN AGENCY FOR COORDINATING INTELLIGENCE ON MAJOR PROJECTS. WE HAVE ALSO STRENGTHENED OUR PROGRAM FOR SUPPORTING THE COMMERCIAL WORK OF THE CONSULATES.\n4. IN THE SECOND AREA, WE HAVE CREATED THE NUCLEUS OF AN ADDITIONAL INDUSTRY UNIT IN THE COMMERCIAL OFFICE BY TRANSFERRING TO THAT OFFICE AN FSO FROM ELSEWHERE IN THE CONOMIC SECTION AND WE ARE INVESTIGATING THE POSSIBILITY OF REASSIGNING TWO FRENCH NATIONALS IN ORDER TO FILL OUT THIS UNIT.\n5. IN THE THIRD AREA WE ARE EXPERIMENTING WITH THE TECHNIQUE OF SETTING UP TEMPORARY AD HOC TASK FORCES COMPRISED OF ECONOMIC AND COMMERCIAL OFFICERS TO DEAL WITH SPECIFIC PROBLEMS. ONE OF THE MAIN PURPOSES OF THIS EXPERIMENT IS TO ENHANCE THE ROLE OF COMMERCIAL OFFICERS BY INVOLVING THEM MORE EXTENSIVELY IN SUBSTANTIVE WORK. OUR EXPERIENCE WITH A TASK FORCE SET-UP TO EXAMINE THE EFFECTS OF THE ENERGY CRISIS ON THE FRENCH ECONOMY HAS BEEN PARTICULARLY ENCOURAGING.\n6. WE SHALL CONTINUE TO SEEK OPPORTUNITIES WITHIN THE LIMITS OF OUR OWN RESOURCES TO STRENGTHEN OUR COMMERCIAL PROGRAM. BUT WE BELIEVE THE DEPARTMENT SHOULD BE AWARE THAT IN THE SECOND AND THIRD AREAS THESE LIMITS ARE EXTREMELY NARROW. IN THE SECOND AREA, WE BELIEVE, AS WE STATED IN PARIS 5369, THAT A CASE CAN BE MADE FOR INCREASING THE PERSONNEL RESOURCES ASSIGNED TO COMMERCIAL WORK. BUT WE RECOGNIZE THAT THE PROSPECTS FOR OBTAINING ADDITIONAL POSITIONS ARE MEAGRE AND THAT THE ONLY SURE WAY TO INCREASE COMMERCIAL STAFF IS BY REALLOCATING RESOURCES INTERNALLY. AS WE NOTED ABOVE, WE HAVE ALREADY TAKEN CERTAIN STEPS IN THIS DIRECTION AND WE PLAN FURTHER STEPS. WE ARE ESTABLISHING AN EMBASSY TASK FORCE TO LOOK INTO THE POSSIBILITIES FOR TRANSFERRING POSITIONS FROM OTHER MISSION ACTIVITES WHICH WE BELIEVE ENJOY A LOWER PRIORITY THAN EXPORT PROMOTION. BUT IT SHOULD BE RECOGNIZED THAT IT IS EXTREMELY DIFFICULT FOR AN EMBASSY TO TRANSFER POSITIONS FROM, SAY, THE POLITICAL OR THE ADMINISTRATIVE SECTIONS TO THE COMMERCIAL SECTION WITHOUT A MUCH MORE AUTHORITATIVE ASSESSSMENT THAN IS NOW AVAILABLE OF U.S. OBJECTIVES AND PRIORITIES IN THE HOST COUNTRY AS WEIGHED AGAINST THE OVERALL VIEW OF US INTERESTS. WE BELIEVE THAT THE DEPARTMENT MUST DEVELOP A MUCH MORE EFFECTIVE INSTRUMENT THAN IT NOW POSSESSES FOR DETERMINING THESE OBJECTIVES AND PRIORITIES. A START HAS BEEN MADE IN THE EUROPEAN BUREAU WITH THE PARA SYSTEM, BUT IN THEIR PRESENT FORM THE PARA PAPERS COVER ONLY PA (POLICY ANALYSIS) BUT NOT RA (RESOURCE ALLOCATION). THEY ARE THUS INCAPABLE OF PROVIDING GUIDANCE AND AUTHORITY WHICH WOULD PERMIT A RATIONAL REALLOCATION OF RESOURCES WITHIN AN EMBASSY ON ANY BUT THE SMALLEST SCALE. WE BELIEVE THE DEPARTMENT SHOULD ASSIGN A HIGH PRIORITY TO THE PERFECTION OF THIS SYSTEM.\n7. THERE ARE SIMILAR LIMITATIONS ON THE ABILITY OF AN EMBASSY TO INCREASE THE INTEGRATION OF ECONOMIC AND COMMERCIAL WORK. OUR VIEWS ON THIS SUBJECT WILL BE STATED MORE FULLY IN OUR REPLY TO THE DEPARTMENTS A-10322. FOR THE PRESENT, SUFFICE IT TO SAY THAT, WITHOUT THE FULL BACKING OF THE VARIOUS WASINGTON AGENCIES WITH FOREIGN ECONOMIC RESPONSIBILITIES AND REPRESENTATION, IT IS SIMPLY UNREALISTIC TO TALK ABOUT THE INTEGRATION OF ANY POSITIONS EXCEPT THOSE OCCUPIED BY FSOS.\n8. A RECOMMENDATION MADE IN EARLIER MESSAGES WHICH WE SHOULD LIKE TO REPEAT IS THE ONE CONCERNING THE STRENGTHENING OF THE COMMERCE DISTRICT OFFICES. WITHOUT EFFECTIVE FOLLO-UP OF TRADE OPPORTUNITIES BY THESE OFFICES, MUCH OF THE FIELDS WORK WILL BE IN VAIN. A START HAS BEEN MADE IN THIS DIRECTION, BUT WE DO NOT BELIEVE IT IS ENOUGH.\n7.

KATHMANDU 44961 SUMMARY: Looked at from Kathmandu frictions between India and Nepal seem                        to be on the increase and may well further intensify in 1974 Minor border raids from India by                        Nepali Congress dissidents and impact of shortages in India on Nepalese                        economy are principal sources of friction USG will want to avoid involvement in these disputes as long as                        regional stability not threatened and to maintain existing policies based on                        our bilateral interests in each country END SUMMARY2 In recent weeks there have been increasing storm signals in IndoNepalese                        relations At various places along IndoNepalese border minor but violent                        incidents have occurred in which socalled antisocial elements have been                        attacking police posts looting grain stocks and in most serious incident                        attempting bomb principal bank at Biratnagar It is widely accepted by                        Nepalese that antisocial elements are in fact Nepali Congress dissidents                        operating from Indian sanctuaries with aim of undermining regime of KING                        BIRENDRA Given understanding which GON                        received from GOI during KINGs State visit                        to Delhi that NCP dissidents would be kept at least fifty miles from border                        Nepalese are concerned about Indian intentions This concern is intensified                        by belief that Nepal has not received what it considers to be adequate                        satisfaction from GOI authorities on 1972                        Haripur incident and subsequent RNAC skyjacking3 As Embassy Delhi rightly observes GOI is sympathetic to democratic                        forces in Nepal It probably cannot control all crossborder activities of                        NCP adherents though GON undoubtedly                        expects it to do so and interprets failure in this regard as evidence of Indian pressure for                        political change As we indicated RefTel                        B we anticipate some increase in level of unrest in Nepal unless economic                        situation takes unexpected turn for better In this situation violent                        incidents may increase and India is likely to get the blame The more that                        Indian politicians and diplomats talk about Indian affinity for democratic                        systems the more this is read in Kathmandu as intent to support subversion                        from without We do not anticipate that rising violence will have effect of                        pursuading KING to liberalize his regime as Indians might like and                        repression seems more likely than compromise4 If in these circumstances COI may be tempted to unleash NCP effects                        on stability in Nepal could be serious It is of course not in our                        interest that India meddle in Nepals internal affairs not only because of                        adverse impact on development prospects but also because of enhanced                        dangerof SinoIndian confrontation in and over Nepal5 On economic front Nepalese are chafing under terms of trade and transit                        agreement They believe India is able to meet Nepalese economic demands                        which they perceive to be limited in scope Nepalese do not understand that                        India cannot always meet requirements of extremely backward country of 12                        million people Petroleum and other shortages which have already developed                        here or which are likely to develop may well be seen by Nepalese as                        evidence of deliberate Indian policy rather than as inevitable result of                        worldwide situation6 Unfortunately Indian aid while generous in global terms has not done                        much to increase longrun selfreliance of Nepal which may in fact be                        economic chimaera Infrastructure projects such as EastWest highway or Kosi                        barrage are felt by Nepalese to be as much in Indias strategic and economic                        interest as in Nepals GONs skittishness                        about Karnali is in part reflection of Nepals preoccupation that it not be                        taken for economic ride in any future agreements with India Given virtual                        total dependence of Nepalese economy on India GON fears being dragged down by Indian economic failure but is                        not yet mature enough to recognize it could be buoyed up by Indian                        success7 Question of economic relationship between India and Nepal is one which has                        dimension for US policy During 1960s we endeavored to encourage economic                        and strategic complementarity between Nepal and India In recent years and                        particularly since 1971 we have tried to look at Nepal as entity worthy of                        attention in its own right This does not mean however that the                        imperatives of economic interdependence between Nepal and India can or                        should be depreciated On contrary a constructive amicable and mutually                        supportive interdependence between the two countries serves our basic                        interests in stability and economic development in the subcontinent While                        recognizing the benefits of some diversification in Nepali trade we do not                        believe it would be either possible or desirable to embark on policies                        designed to alter significantly the interdependence between Nepal and                        India8 As and if tensions rise in Nepal and economic and political frictions                        between Nepal and India increase we will want in Nepal to maintain our                        current posture of steady and sympathetic support for Nepals development                        objectives and political integrity As long as regional stability not                        threatened we would not propose to offer Nepal advice about its relations

THIS                            CREDIBILITY QUESTION RELATES BOTH TO THE SINCERITY OF THESE INTENTIONS                            AND HIS CAPABILITY TO CARRY THEM OUT TO SAY THAT THIS IS UNFORTUNATE IS                            REALLY AN UNDERSTATEMENT  BECAUSE THIS IS REALLY THE NUB OF THE                            PROBLEMITEM NO 4: IS HE DOING THE RIGHT THINGS AS FAR AS THE DIRECTION OF HIS

HAS HAPPENED                            HERE PROBABLY HAD TO HAPPEN AT SOME TIME THE STATEMENT OF MARCOS THAT THIS IS A SICK                            SOCIETY IS NO EXAGGERATION ALTHOUGH THERE ARE THOSE THAT WOULD ADD                            THAT HE IS MERELY THE LATEST OF A LONG LINE OF PREDECESSORS THAT HELPED                            MAKE IT SO BE THAT AS IT MAY THE MERE FACT THAT AN HONEST NATIONWIDE                            PLEBISCITE ON THE QUESTION OF STATEHOODUSA WOULD PROBABLY HAVE WON IS                            AMPLE INDICATION OF FRUSTRATIONS OF THE MASSES AT THEIR OWN SYSTEM I DO                            NOT BELIEVE WE SHOULD CRY TOO MUCH OVER A TEMPORARY LOSS OF DEMOCRACY AS                            IT WORKED IN THE PHILIPPINES AS DEMOCRACY IS DEEPLY ROOTED AND                            PREDICTABLY WILL RETURN IN TIME AND ONE WOULD HOPE IN A MORE EFFECTIVE                            MANNER THE QUESTION BEFORE US THEREFORE IS REALLY WHETHER THIS IS THE                            RIGHT TIME WHETHER THIS IS THE RIGHT MAN AND WHETHER HE IS DOING IT                            THE RIGHT WAYITEM NO 2: IS IT THE RIGHT TIME I WOULD SAY THERE IS NOTHING WRONG AS                            REGARDS TIMING IF CHANGE HAD TO COME TO THE PHILIPPINES PROBABLY                            BETTER NOW THAN LATER BECAUSE THE TREND WAS SO BAD THAT DELAY MIGHT                            HAVE INCREASED THE CHANCES A CHANGE WOULD BE MORE VIOLENT AND BLOODY                            WHICH SO FAR HAS NOT BEEN THAT CASEITEM NO 3: IS THIS THE RIGHT MAN MARCOS IS WITHOUT DOUBT THE                            MOST CAPABLE MAN OF ANYONE ON THE SCENE WHO HAD ANY CHANCE TO BE IN                            POWER AT THIS POINT IN TIME IN THE PHILIPPINES AND YET HE STARTS HIS                            TASK WITH VERY LOW CREDIBILITY INDEED AND THERE ARE ELEMENTS OF BOTH                            CONCERN AND FEAR AMONG THE POPULACE AS TO HIS INTENTIONS THIS                            CREDIBILITY QUESTION RELATES BOTH TO THE SINCERITY OF THESE INTENTIONS                            AND HIS CAPABILITY TO CARRY THEM OUT TO SAY THAT THIS IS UNFORTUNATE IS                            REALLY AN UNDERSTATEMENT  BECAUSE THIS IS REALLY THE NUB OF THE                            PROBLEMITEM NO 4: IS HE DOING THE RIGHT THINGS AS FAR AS THE DIRECTION OF HIS                            PROGRAM OF REFORM IS CONCERNED THE ANSWER IS GENERALLY YES HOWEVER                            HIS PROGRAM WHILE PRAISEWORTHY IS PROBABLY OVERAMBITIOUS AND THERE IS                            SOME DANGER THAT THE LIMITED RESOURCES AND TALENTS AVAILABLE TO                            ACCOMPLISH IT MIGHT BE DISSIPATED IN AN EFFORT TO DO TOO MUCH WITH TOO                            LITTLE I WILL NOT TAKE UP SPACE BY LISTING THE STEPS HE HAS ALREADY                            TAKEN THAT ARE BENEFICIAL AND THAT ARE WIDELY ACCEPTABLE SOME LIKE THE                            PICKING UP OF GUNS AND DISBANDMENT OF PRIVATE ARMIES ARE NEARLY                            FINISHED OTHERS LIKE GETTING RID OF THE INEFFICIENT AND CORRUPT ARE                            ONLY PARTIALLY UNDERWAY HE WILL HAVE TO CONTINUE PROGRAMS SUCH AS THESE                            AND AT A HIGHER AND HIGHER LEVEL IN GOVERNMENT UNTIL IT REACHES THE TOP                            TO REGAIN HIS MUCH NEEDED CREDIBILITYITEM NO 5 NO ONE WANTS THE SYSTEM TO RETURN AS IT WAS BEFORE IN ANY                            HONEST REFERENDUM IN THE PHILIPPINES THE PEOPLE WOULD HAVE VOTED FOR THE

HAS NOT BEEN                            ACCOMPANIED BY XENOPHOBIA AND NATIONALISM WITH ANTIFOREIGN TONES QUITE                            THE OPPOSITE IS TRUE AND THIS IS SIMPLY BECAUSE MARCOS KNOWS THAT HE NEEDS                            FOREIGN INVESTMENT TO HELP THE COUNTRY DEVELOP IT IS FOR THIS REASON                            THAT HE TOOK A HAND IN DRAFTING THE NEW CONSTITUTION TO MAKE IT MORE                            FAVORABLE TO FOREIGN INTERESTS PARTICULARLY US THAN THE OLD                            CONSTITUTIONITEM NO 7: IF MARCOS                            FAILS OR SOMETHING HAPPENS TO HIM THE NEW CONSTITUTION WILL PROBABLY                            AND PARTICULARLY DUE TO HIS MANNER OF RATIFICATION BE TORN UP BY                            SUCCESSORS ANY SUCCEEDING CONSTITUTION UNDER THESE CIRCUMSTANCES WOULD                            ALMOST CERTAINLY BE MORE NATIONALISTIC AND LESS FAVORABLE TO FOREIGN                            INTERESTSITEM NO 8: IF MARCOS                            FAILS OR IF SOMETHING ELSE HAPPENS TO TAKE HIM OFF THE SCENE WE COULD                            BE FACED WITH A CHAOTIC SITUATION THERE IS ALREADY ALMOST NOTHING LEFT                            OF THE TRADITIONAL PARTY STRUCTURE THAT COULD TAKE OVER IN ANY ORGANIZED                            SORT OF WAY THE ULTIMATE RESULT MIGHT BE THAT THE MILITARY ALMOST BY                            NECESSITY WOULD HAVE TO TAKE OVER COMPLETELY THERE WOULD BE                            PREDICTABLE SPLITS WITHIN THEIR RANKS AND THEIR STRENGTH AND CAPABILITY                            IS NOT ALL THAT GOOD IN ANY EVENT AND THE COUNTRY WOULD BE FACED IN                            TIME WITH THE INEVITABLE PROPOSITION THAT ONCE THE MILITARY HAVE TASTED                            POWER

HAS HAPPENED                            HERE PROBABLY HAD TO HAPPEN AT SOME TIME THE STATEMENT OF MARCOS THAT THIS IS A SICK                            SOCIETY IS NO EXAGGERATION ALTHOUGH THERE ARE THOSE THAT WOULD ADD                            THAT HE IS MERELY THE LATEST OF A LONG LINE OF PREDECESSORS THAT HELPED                            MAKE IT SO BE THAT AS IT MAY THE MERE FACT THAT AN HONEST NATIONWIDE                            PLEBISCITE ON THE QUESTION OF STATEHOODUSA WOULD PROBABLY HAVE WON IS                            AMPLE INDICATION OF FRUSTRATIONS OF THE MASSES AT THEIR OWN SYSTEM I DO                            NOT BELIEVE WE SHOULD CRY TOO MUCH OVER A TEMPORARY LOSS OF DEMOCRACY AS                            IT WORKED IN THE PHILIPPINES AS DEMOCRACY IS DEEPLY ROOTED AND                            PREDICTABLY WILL RETURN IN TIME AND ONE WOULD HOPE IN A MORE EFFECTIVE                            MANNER THE QUESTION BEFORE US THEREFORE IS REALLY WHETHER THIS IS THE                            RIGHT TIME WHETHER THIS IS THE RIGHT MAN AND WHETHER HE IS DOING IT                            THE RIGHT WAYITEM NO 2: IS IT THE RIGHT TIME I WOULD SAY THERE IS NOTHING WRONG AS                            REGARDS TIMING IF CHANGE HAD TO COME TO THE PHILIPPINES PROBABLY                            BETTER NOW THAN LATER BECAUSE THE TREND WAS SO BAD THAT DELAY MIGHT                            HAVE INCREASED THE CHANCES A CHANGE WOULD BE MORE VIOLENT AND BLOODY                            WHICH SO FAR HAS NOT BEEN THAT CASEITEM NO 3: IS THIS THE RIGHT MAN MARCOS IS WITHOUT DOUBT THE                            MOST CAPABLE MAN OF ANYONE ON THE SCENE WHO HAD ANY CHANCE TO BE IN                            POWER AT THIS POINT IN TIME IN THE PHILIPPINES AND YET HE STARTS HIS                            TASK WITH VERY LOW CREDIBILITY INDEED AND THERE ARE ELEMENTS OF BOTH                            CONCERN AND FEAR AMONG THE POPULACE AS TO HIS INTENTIONS THIS                            CREDIBILITY QUESTION RELATES BOTH TO THE SINCERITY OF THESE INTENTIONS                            AND HIS CAPABILITY TO CARRY THEM OUT TO SAY THAT THIS IS UNFORTUNATE IS                            REALLY AN UNDERSTATEMENT  BECAUSE THIS IS REALLY THE NUB OF THE                            PROBLEMITEM NO 4: IS HE DOING THE RIGHT THINGS AS FAR AS THE DIRECTION OF HIS                            PROGRAM OF REFORM IS CONCERNED THE ANSWER IS GENERALLY YES HOWEVER                            HIS PROGRAM WHILE PRAISEWORTHY IS PROBABLY OVERAMBITIOUS AND THERE IS                            SOME DANGER THAT THE LIMITED RESOURCES AND TALENTS AVAILABLE TO                            ACCOMPLISH IT MIGHT BE DISSIPATED IN AN EFFORT TO DO TOO MUCH WITH TOO                            LITTLE I WILL NOT TAKE UP SPACE BY LISTING THE STEPS HE HAS ALREADY                            TAKEN THAT ARE BENEFICIAL AND THAT ARE WIDELY ACCEPTABLE SOME LIKE THE                            PICKING UP OF GUNS AND DISBANDMENT OF PRIVATE ARMIES ARE NEARLY                            FINISHED OTHERS LIKE GETTING RID OF THE INEFFICIENT AND CORRUPT ARE                            ONLY PARTIALLY UNDERWAY HE WILL HAVE TO CONTINUE PROGRAMS SUCH AS THESE                            AND AT A HIGHER AND HIGHER LEVEL IN GOVERNMENT UNTIL IT REACHES THE TOP                            TO REGAIN HIS MUCH NEEDED CREDIBILITYITEM NO 5 NO ONE WANTS THE SYSTEM TO RETURN AS IT WAS BEFORE IN ANY                            HONEST REFERENDUM IN THE PHILIPPINES THE PEOPLE WOULD HAVE VOTED FOR THE

   STATE OF SOCIETY THERE ARE VERY FEW VOICES OF DISAPPROVAL THAT EVEN                            SENATORS AND CONGRESSMEN ARE NOW OUT OF A JOBITEM NO 6: CONTRARY TO USUAL PATTERN CHANGE HERE SO FAR HAS NOT BEEN                            ACCOMPANIED BY XENOPHOBIA AND NATIONALISM WITH ANTIFOREIGN TONES QUITE                            THE OPPOSITE IS TRUE AND THIS IS SIMPLY BECAUSE MARCOS KNOWS THAT HE NEEDS                            FOREIGN INVESTMENT TO HELP THE COUNTRY DEVELOP IT IS FOR THIS REASON                            THAT HE TOOK A HAND IN DRAFTING THE NEW CONSTITUTION TO MAKE IT MORE                            FAVORABLE TO FOREIGN INTERESTS PARTICULARLY US THAN THE OLD                            CONSTITUTIONITEM NO 7: IF MARCOS                            FAILS OR SOMETHING HAPPENS TO HIM THE NEW CONSTITUTION WILL PROBABLY                            AND PARTICULARLY DUE TO HIS MANNER OF RATIFICATION BE TORN UP BY                            SUCCESSORS ANY SUCCEEDING CONSTITUTION UNDER THESE CIRCUMSTANCES WOULD                            ALMOST CERTAINLY BE MORE NATIONALISTIC AND LESS FAVORABLE TO FOREIGN                            INTERESTSITEM NO 8: IF MARCOS                            FAILS OR IF SOMETHING ELSE HAPPENS TO TAKE HIM OFF THE SCENE WE COULD                            BE FACED WITH A CHAOTIC SITUATION THERE IS ALREADY ALMOST NOTHING LEFT                            OF THE TRADITIONAL PARTY STRUCTURE THAT COULD TAKE OVER IN ANY ORGANIZED                            SORT OF WAY THE ULTIMATE RESULT MIGHT BE THAT THE MILITARY ALMOST BY                            NECESSITY WOULD HAVE TO TAKE OVER COMPLETELY THERE WOULD BE                            PREDICTABLE SPLITS WITHIN THEIR RANKS AND THEIR STRENGTH AND CAPABILITY                            IS NOT ALL THAT GOOD IN ANY EVENT AND THE COUNTRY WOULD BE FACED IN                            TIME WITH THE INEVITABLE PROPOSITION THAT ONCE THE MILITARY HAVE TASTED                            POWER TO THE EXTENT THEY MIGHT NOW WILLINGLY AGREE WITHIN SOME                            REASONABLE AND SHORT PERIOD TO GO BACK TO THE BARRACKS AND THE PARADE                            GROUND SINCE THEY WOULD HAVE TO RELY ON THE SUPPORT OF CONSERVATIVE                            POLITICAL ELEMENTS THIS COULD ACCENTUATE A TREND TOWARD THE                            POLARIZATION OF POLITICAL FORCES IN

PROFESSOR B. R. SHENOY, OF THE ECONOMICS RESEARCH CENTRE, NEW DELHI, IS EVIDENTLY PLANNING TO WRITE TO ALL MEMBERS OF THE FOREIGN RELATIONS AND FOREIGN AFFAIRS AND AGRICUL- TURE COMMITTEES EXPRESSING HIS OPPOSITION TO THE RUPEE AGREEMENT. PROFESSOR SHENOY HAS BEEN ACTIVE FOR YEARS IN ATTACKING USG HOLDINGS OF RUPEES CLAIMING THAT THESE HOLDINGS WERE INFLATIONARY. WITH THE INITIALING OF A RUPEE AGREEMENT, HE HAS NOW COME TO THE ERRONEOUS CONCLUSION THAT ALL THESE RUPEE HOLDINGS WOULD BE ""MONETIZED"" AND THATTHIS WOULD CAUSE EVENTUAL INFLATION.\n2.  SHENOY IS CONSIDERED A DECENT BUT CRACKPOT ECONOMIST WHOSE PEARLS OF WISDOM HAVE OFTEN BEEN SENT TO VARIOUS US POLITICAL FIGURES. HIS WRITINGS APPEAR EXTENSIVELY IN THE FAR RIGHT WING PRESS IN INDIA, ALSO OCCASIONALLY IN MORE RESPECTABLE PUBLICATIONS.  THE INDIAN GOVERNMENT CONSIDERS HIM AN ECCENTRIC WHOM IT GENERALLY IGNORES.\n3.

FONMIN EXPRESSED VIEW THAT NORTH KOREANS WOULD BE UNLIKELY TO SEE ANY ADVANTAGE IN ACCEPTING CHANG KI-YONGS CALL FOR EARLY RESUMPTION OF SOUTH-NORTH MEETING. INSTEAD, HE FELT IT MUCH MORE LIKELY THAT NORTH KOREANS WOULD ATTEMPT TO EXTRACT PROPAGANDA ADVANTAGE FROM POLITICAL DIFFICULTIES WHICH HAD FORCED ROK TO INSTITUTE EMERGENCY MEASURES.  HE THEREFORE THOUGHT IT LIKELY THAT NORTH KOREANS WOULD RESPOND TO PROPOSAL OF NON-AGGRESSION PACT WITH PROPAGANDA BLAST IN WHICH THEY WOULD DISMISS NON-AGGRESSION PACT AS IMPOSSIBILITY WITHOUT PRIOR OR AT LEAST CONCURRENT AGREEMENT ON MEASURES THEY HAVE RAISED BEFORE, SUCH AS DISSOLUTION OF UN COMMAND, WITHDRAWAL OF US FORCES, PEACE TREATY, ETC.

COMMUNITY PERHAPS ONE OF UTILITIES OF                            UN IS THAT IT OBLIGES OTHERWISE SELFCENTERED NATIONS OF ALL SHAPES AND                            SIZES TO LOOK HOWEVER MYOPICALLY AT WHOLE WORLD COMMUNITY WE MUST IN                            JUDGING UN FOR OURSELVES REMAIN AWARE THAT IF UN CANNOT BE MUCH BETTER                            THAN SUM OF ITS PARTS AND THAT IF UN DID

FROM GENERAL CONSENSUS THIS CAN RE DOCUMENTED ON POLITICAL ISSUES BUT                            I BELIEVE STATEMENT COULD CONTRIBUTE TO MISUNDERSTANDING OF OUR TOTAL                            POSITION WE MUST MAKE DISTINCTION BETWEEN TACTICAL ISOLATION AS WHEN                            WE CHOOSE TO BE ONLY ABSTAINER ON ESTABLISHING WDC STUDY COMMITTEE OR LONE NAY IN COMMITTEE ON KENYAS                            BID FOR ENVIRONMENT SECRETARIAT AND ISOLATION ON SUBSTANCE ON BOTH WDC                            AND UNCHE WE OPTED FOR UNIQUE VOTING POSITION BUT WERE BY NO MEANS                            ALONE IN OUR SUBSTANTIVE VIEWS ON BOTH ISSUES A SIGNIFICANT MINORITY OF                            PRESTIGIOUS UN MEMBERS SHARED OUR RESERVATIONS AND NEGATIVE VIEWS BUT                            ELECTED TO AVOID ISOLATED VOTING POSTURE6 ON BROAD ISSUES OF SUBSTANCE THERE ARE VERY FEW AREAS IN WHICH WE                            TEND TO BE GENUINELY ISOLATED AS ISRAEL BECOMES INCREASINGLY ISOLATED                            US AS ISRAELS FOREMOST CHAMPION TENDS TO BE ISOLATED IN TURN EVEN IN                            THIS CASE IT IS THOUGHT THAT US HAS UNIQUE POTENTIAL

RECORDS TO BE                            RELATIVELY ISOLATED BUT AGAIN IN THIS INSTANCE THE ISOLATION IS MORE                            TACTICAL THAN SUBSTANTIVE AND THE BASIC SINCERITY OF OUR BELIEF

REF A IMPLIES AN IMMEDIATE REQUIREMENT TO PUBLICIZE LOCALLY THE CONSTRAINTS THAT MUST BE APPLIED TO THE MIA/ BNR REWARDS PROGRAM ANNOUNCED BY AP RELEASE ON 1  JUNE 1973.  TO THE BEST OF OUR KNOWLEDGE,  THE LOCAL MEDIA HAS NOT PUBLISHED ANY RELEASES RELATING TO THE CURRENT U. S.  REWARDS POLICY.  CONFIDENTIAL\n2.  THE CONSTRAINTS OUTLINED IN REF B ARE REALISTIC,  BUT BY THEIR NATURE THEY PRECLUDE REWARD PAYMENTS IN LAOS,  AS U. S. VISITATION TO CRASH/ GRAVE SITES IS REQUIRED.  TO DATE,  THE LPF HAVE NOT GIVEN ANY INDICATION AS TO THE DEGREE OF U. S.  PARTICIPA- TION,  IF ANY,  THAT WILL BE PERMITTED DURING FUTURE CASUALTY RESOLUTION ACTIVITIES.\n3.  IT WOULD BE PREMATURE TO SURFACE THE REWARDS ISSUE IN THE LOCAL LAO NEWS MEDIA AT THIS TIME,  SINCE WEA RE NOT IN A POSITION TO FOLLOW THROUGH WITH ANY CONFIRMATION ACTION.  ONCE THE PARA- METERS OF CASUALTY RESOLUTION ACTIVITIES ARE ESTABLISHED BY THE LAO PARTIES,  WE CAN COORDINATE WITH JCRC IN ESTABLISHING A REWARDS PROGRAM TAILORED TO THE LAOTIAN SITUATION.\n4.  PRACTICAL CONSTRAINTS MENTIONED ABOVE,  WHICH WILL NOT PERMIT PRESENT PAYMENT OF REWARDS,  COULD JEOPARDIZE EFFECTIVENESS OF REWARD SYSTEM AT TIME WHEN IT WILL BE MORE MEANINGFUL.  WE THEREFORE RECOMMEND THAT SUBJECT OF REWARD PAYMENTS IN LAOS BE PLAYED- DOWN TO EXTENT POSSIBLE IN FUTURE RELEASES.  UNLESS ADDRESSEES PERCEIVE OBJECTION,  WE WILL NOT RELEASE ANY REWARD INFORMATION TO LOCAL MEDIA. DEAN\n",791161

FROM GENERAL CONSENSUS THIS CAN RE DOCUMENTED ON POLITICAL ISSUES BUT                            I BELIEVE STATEMENT COULD CONTRIBUTE TO MISUNDERSTANDING OF OUR TOTAL                            POSITION WE MUST MAKE DISTINCTION BETWEEN TACTICAL ISOLATION AS WHEN                            WE CHOOSE TO BE ONLY ABSTAINER ON ESTABLISHING WDC STUDY COMMITTEE OR LONE NAY IN COMMITTEE ON KENYAS                            BID FOR ENVIRONMENT SECRETARIAT AND ISOLATION ON SUBSTANCE ON BOTH WDC                            AND UNCHE WE OPTED FOR UNIQUE VOTING POSITION BUT WERE BY NO MEANS                            ALONE IN OUR SUBSTANTIVE VIEWS ON BOTH ISSUES A SIGNIFICANT MINORITY OF                            PRESTIGIOUS UN MEMBERS SHARED OUR RESERVATIONS AND NEGATIVE VIEWS BUT                            ELECTED TO AVOID ISOLATED VOTING POSTURE6 ON BROAD ISSUES OF SUBSTANCE THERE ARE VERY FEW AREAS IN WHICH WE                            TEND TO BE GENUINELY ISOLATED AS ISRAEL BECOMES INCREASINGLY ISOLATED                            US AS ISRAELS FOREMOST CHAMPION TENDS TO BE ISOLATED IN TURN EVEN IN                            THIS CASE IT IS THOUGHT THAT US HAS UNIQUE POTENTIAL FOR CATALYZING                            NEGOTIATIONS AND SOME ARABS WHO THINK OUR BEHAVIOR NOW PROISRAELI HAVE                            CONFIDENCE IN OUR FUNDAMENTAL FAIRNESS WE HAVE BEEN

RECORDS TO BE                            RELATIVELY ISOLATED BUT AGAIN IN THIS INSTANCE THE ISOLATION IS MORE                            TACTICAL THAN SUBSTANTIVE AND THE BASIC SINCERITY OF OUR BELIEF IN                            SELFDETERMINATION AND OUR OPPOSITION TO RACISM IS GENERALLY                            RESPECTED7 OUR RELATIVE TACTICAL ISOLATION IN VOTING RECORDS HAS SOMETIMES BEEN                            RESULT OF BLOC VOTING WHILE BLOC VOTING IS NOT NECESSARILY BAD AND IN                            SOME FORM CHARACTERIZES SOME OF WORLDS MOST EFFECTIVE PARLIAMENTS BLOC

COUNTERTREND LIMITING THIS TENDENCY IN                            SOME INSTANCES REGIONAL GROUPS HAVE PERCEIVED ADVANTAGE IN SUFFICIENTLY                            MODERATING THEIR POSITIONS TO PILE

COMMUNITY PERHAPS ONE OF UTILITIES OF                            UN IS THAT IT OBLIGES OTHERWISE SELFCENTERED NATIONS OF ALL SHAPES AND                            SIZES TO LOOK HOWEVER MYOPICALLY AT WHOLE WORLD COMMUNITY WE MUST IN                            JUDGING UN FOR OURSELVES REMAIN AWARE THAT IF UN CANNOT BE MUCH BETTER                            THAN SUM OF ITS PARTS AND THAT IF UN DID NOT EXIST WE SHOULD STILL HAVE                            TO FACE SAME RANGE OF INTERNATIONAL ATTITUDES5 IT HAS BEEN OBSERVED THAT US WAS THIS YEAR FREQUENTLY IN ISOLATION                            FROM GENERAL CONSENSUS THIS CAN RE DOCUMENTED ON POLITICAL ISSUES BUT                            I BELIEVE STATEMENT COULD CONTRIBUTE TO MISUNDERSTANDING OF OUR TOTAL                            POSITION WE MUST MAKE DISTINCTION BETWEEN TACTICAL ISOLATION AS WHEN                            WE CHOOSE TO BE ONLY ABSTAINER ON ESTABLISHING WDC STUDY COMMITTEE OR LONE NAY IN COMMITTEE ON KENYAS                            BID FOR ENVIRONMENT SECRETARIAT AND ISOLATION ON SUBSTANCE ON BOTH WDC                            AND UNCHE WE OPTED FOR UNIQUE VOTING POSITION BUT WERE BY NO MEANS                            ALONE IN OUR SUBSTANTIVE VIEWS ON BOTH ISSUES A SIGNIFICANT MINORITY OF                            PRESTIGIOUS UN MEMBERS SHARED OUR RESERVATIONS AND NEGATIVE VIEWS BUT                            ELECTED TO AVOID ISOLATED VOTING POSTURE6 ON BROAD ISSUES OF SUBSTANCE THERE ARE VERY FEW AREAS IN WHICH WE                            TEND TO BE GENUINELY ISOLATED AS ISRAEL BECOMES INCREASINGLY ISOLATED                            US AS ISRAELS FOREMOST CHAMPION TENDS TO BE ISOLATED IN TURN EVEN IN                            THIS CASE IT IS THOUGHT THAT US HAS UNIQUE POTENTIAL FOR CATALYZING                            NEGOTIATIONS AND SOME ARABS WHO THINK OUR BEHAVIOR NOW PROISRAELI HAVE                            CONFIDENCE IN OUR FUNDAMENTAL FAIRNESS WE HAVE BEEN PROTECTED FROM                            ATTACKS ON OUR VIETNAM POSITION BY FACT OTHER SIDE DOES NOT WANT ISSUE                            IN UN ON AFRICAN ISSUES WE SOMETIMES APPEAR IN VOTING RECORDS TO BE                            RELATIVELY ISOLATED BUT AGAIN IN THIS INSTANCE THE ISOLATION IS MORE                            TACTICAL THAN SUBSTANTIVE AND THE BASIC SINCERITY OF OUR BELIEF IN                            SELFDETERMINATION AND OUR OPPOSITION TO RACISM IS GENERALLY                            RESPECTED7 OUR RELATIVE TACTICAL ISOLATION IN VOTING RECORDS HAS SOMETIMES BEEN                            RESULT OF BLOC VOTING WHILE BLOC VOTING IS NOT NECESSARILY BAD AND IN                            SOME FORM CHARACTERIZES SOME OF WORLDS MOST EFFECTIVE PARLIAMENTS BLOC                            VOTING IN UN HAS OFTEN LOWERED STANDARDS AND DISSERVED IMMEDIATE US                            INTERESTS REGIONAL LOYALTY FREQUENTLY LEADS AFRICANS LATIN AMERICANS                            AND ASIANS TO VOTE MORE OR LESS AS BLOCS DESPITE CONFLICTING INTERESTS                            WITHIN GROUPS EVEN THE WEO GROUP VOTES                            AS BLOC ON OCCASION TENDENCY

COUNCIL IN A LATIN AMERICAN CAPITAL                            WHEN UNITY IS SOUGHT ON BASIS THIS KIND OF INHERENTLY EMOTIONAL APPEAL                            TO GROUP LOYALTY IT IS NOT UNNATURAL THAT VOICE OF EMOTION  SOMETIMES                            HIGHLY DEFENSIVE  TAKES PRECEDENCE OVER VOICE OF REALISTIC RATIONAL                            PRAGMATISM8 THERE MAY BE AN INCIPIENT COUNTERTREND LIMITING THIS TENDENCY IN                            SOME INSTANCES REGIONAL GROUPS HAVE PERCEIVED ADVANTAGE IN SUFFICIENTLY                            MODERATING THEIR POSITIONS TO PILE UP IMPRESSIVE MAJORITIES AS AGAINST                            ADVANTAGE OF MORE EXTREME RESOLUTIONS PASSED BY BARE MAJORITIES WHILE                            SPONSORS OF RESOLUTIONS UNACCEPTABLE TO US ARE NO LONGER PREDISPOSED TO                            MODIFY THEM JUST TO GET US VOTE HOWEVER ON KEY ISSUES WHERE US ACTION                            OR MONEY IS REQUIRED NECESSITY OF US SUPPORT OR AT LEAST                            NONOPPOSITION IS RECOGNIZED AND DRAFT RESOLUTIONS ARE OFTEN MODIFIED                            ACCORDINGLY TENDENCY TOWARD BLOC VOTING CAN USUALLY BE COUNTERED                            SUCCESSFULLY IF TIMELY AND DETERMINED EFFORT CAN BE MADE TO SHOW                            INDIVIDUAL MEMBERS OF REGIONAL GROUPS THAT THEIR HARD INTERESTS                            PARTICULARLY THEIR IMMEDIATE FINANCIAL INTERESTS ARE AT STAKE FOR                            EXAMPLE ON 25 PERCENT ASSESSMENT ISSUE OR PROPOSAL WAS NOT VERY                            ATTRACTIVE TO MANY UN MEMBERS WE WERE ABLE NONETHELESS NOT ONLY TO                            PREVENT BLOC OPPOSITION BUT ALSO TO OBTAIN STRONG MAJORITY SUPPORT IN                            AFRICAN GROUP BY EMPHASIZING RELEVANCE OF ISSUE TO CONTINUED STRONG US                            SUPPORT OF UNDP AND OTHER VOLUNTARY                            AGENCIES9 FACT THAT SMALLER AND POORER COUNTRIES TEND TO BE RELATIVELY PRAGMATIC                            IN VIEWING SHORTRANGE ECONOMIC INTERESTS AGAINST BACKGROUND OF US                            STRENGTH IN ECONOMIC RESOURCES AND OF OUR INTEREST IN DEVELOPMENT MAY BE                            IMPORTANT REASON WHY US PRESTIGE REMAINS RELATIVELY HIGH AMONG THOSE                            DELEGATIONS REPRESENTING COUNTRIES WHOSE PRIMARY MOTIVATION IN UN GAME                            IS DESIRE TO RECEIVE DEVELOPMENT BENEFITS10 AMONG TRIALS WE STILL FACE IN UN IS FACTOR THAT RELATES TO BUT GOES                            BEYOND BLOC VOTING PHENOMENON THIS FACTOR IS GROWING COHESION OF                            MAJORITY OF POORER WEAKER SMALLER NATIONS IN UN WHO ARE AWARE THAT                            RICH LARGE POWERFUL NATIONS ARE IN MINORITY AND CAN BE OUTVOTED IN                            SHORTRUN AT LEAST THIS TREND IMPLIES DIFFICULTIES IN MORE GENERAL WAY                            WE CAN OBSERVE THAT HAVENOT NATIONS ARE FREQUENTLY TEMPTED TO SEEK                            SHORTRUN ADVANTAGE INCLUDING PSYCHOLOGICAL ADVANTAGE AT EXPENSE OF                            WHAT WE REGARD AS PRINCIPLE HAVE NATIONS ARE BY NO MEANS IMMUNE FROM                            THIS SORT OF TEMPTATION MOST OF FOUNDING FATHERS OF UN CONSIDERED OR                            PRETENDED TO CONSIDER SANCTITY OF PROPERTY INVIOLABILITY OF CONTRACTS                            AND AGREEMENTS CONSTITUTIONALISM AND RULE OF LAW TO BE OF FUNDAMENTAL                            IMPORTANCE BUT POORER COUNTRIES NOW DO NOT FIND THESE VALUES SO                            IMPORTANT IT MAY BE SOME TIME BEFORE THEY DO SO MEANWHILE THIRD WORLD                            TENDENCIES IN THIS DIRECTION HAVE BEGUN TO CREATE CERTAIN MUTUALITY OF                            INTEREST AMONG HAVES OF VARYING IDEOLOGY THAT DID NOT PREVIOUSLY                            EXIST11 IN SUM AS I LOOK BACK OVER MY EXPERIENCE AT UN OVER PAST TWO YEARS                            I AM NOT TEMPTED TO ENGAGE IN HANDWRINGING I AM CRITICAL HOPEFULLY                            CONSTRUCTIVELY SO OF ASPECTS OF UNITED NATIONS ORGANIZATIONS AND I                            BELIEVE THAT IN BEST OF CIRCUMSTANCES WE ARE GOING TO FACE RECURRENT                            FRUSTRATIONS HOWEVER NOW THAT I KNOW IT AT FIRST HAND I BELIEVE IN                            THE INSTITUTION MORE STRONGLY THAN WHEN I CAME TO NEW YORK THE UN                            SYSTEM HAS ALREADY MADE AND IS MAKING SIGNIFICANT CONTRIBUTIONS TO                            WELFARE OF OUR COUNTRY AND OF ALL MANKIND PARTICULARLY ON THE ECONOMIC                            AND SOCIAL SIDE THERE IS GENERAL RECOGNITION THAT IN THESE AREAS                            EFFECTIVENESS OF UN ACTIVITIES NEEDS IMPROVING AND I BELIEVE THIS                            PROCESS IS ALREADY UNDER WAY IN MY VIEW LIMITATIONS TO SUCCESS ON                            POLITICAL SIDE ARE OFTEN INHERENT IN ASSOCIATION OF SOVEREIGN STATES AND                            REFLECT LESS STRONGLY ON VALIDITY OF UN STRUCTURE THAN ON SOUNDNESS AND                            WISDOM OF GOVERNMENTS THAT ARE ITS CONSTITUENTS THE UN IS SLOWLY                            BECOMING MORE LIKE A PARLIAMENT A POLITICAL RATHER THAN A DIPLOMATIC                            INSTITUTION I HAVE FOUND IT EXCITING AND CHALLENGING TO REPRESENT US IN                            THIS POLITICAL ARENA AND HAVE CONFIDENCE THAT WE CAN ACHIEVE OUR                            FUNDAMENTAL OBJECTIVES AT UN IF WE MAKE THE EFFORTAND THAT IT IS WORTH                            THE EFFORT XGDS BUSH,frus1969-76ve14p1d3,"3.\n1.  SUMMARY: REF. B LISTED PHOTOKINA (COLOGNE, SEPT. 27 OCT\n2.  COMMERCE HAS PLANNED TO TAKE PART IN THE LAST TWO PHOTOKINAS, ONLY TO WITHDRAW BECAUSE OF BUDGETARY CONSIDATIONS AFTER THE FAIR AUT*ORITIES FULLY EXPECTED OFFICIAL US PARTICIPATION. THE FAIR AUTHORITIES WERE MOST COOPERATIVE IN ASSISTING US IN PRELIMINARY PLANNING FOR POSSIBLE PARTICIPATION IN THE 1970.\n3. THE COLOGNE FIAR AUTHORITIES ARE MOST ANXIOUS TO HAVE A US GROUP STAND AT PHOTOKINA, AND HAVE AGREED TO ASSIST THROUGH THEIR US REPRESENTATIVES IN RECRUITING US FIRMS. WE HAVE INFORMED COLOGNE THAT WE SHALL MAKE EVERY EFFORT OT SECURE SUFFICIENT FIRMS TO MAKE A GROUP STAND FEASIBLE, AND SHALL WORK WITH THE FAIR AUTHORITIES IN ORGANIZING AND  PROMOTING THE STAND. WE ARE HOPEFUL THAT COMMERCE WILL BE ABLE TO OFFER SOME ASSISTANCE TO OUR EFFORTS, BOTH BUDGETARY AND OTHERWISE. SPECIFIC NON-BUDGETARY HELP WE WOULD WISH TO HAVE INCLUDE (A) COMMERCE AGREEMENT TO WORK WITH THE FAIR AUTHORITYS US REPRESENTATIVE IN RECRUITING, AND (B) THE GUIDANCE ON EXHIBIT LAYOUTS, PROMOTION ETC., DESCRIBED IN REF. A.\n4.  WE ARE ALSO CONSIDERING THE INCLUSION IN THE US STAND OF A CATALOG SHOW, FOR THE BENEFIT OF US FIRMS UNABLE TO EXHIBIT, AND WOULD BE GRATEFUL FOR THE VIEWS OF THE DEPT. OF COMMERCE ON THIS POINT.\n5.  ACTION REQUESTED: PLEASE LET US KNOW AS SOON AS POSSIBLE THE EXTENT TO WHICH COMMERCE WILL BE ABLE TO SUPPORT OUR EFFORTS AT PHOTOKIN\n",791210
